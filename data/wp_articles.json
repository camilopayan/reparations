[" The Skol Company produced Skol antiseptic for sunburn[1] and Skol sunglasses[2] from the 1920s[3]  through the mid-1940s. Based in New York City,[4] their products were available in the United States and Canada.[5] George Gallowhur was president of the business.[4] He developed Skol suntan lotion in the Austrian Alps in the 1920s. He also introduced  Skat insect repellent.[3]\n In April 1938, the firm signed a five-year contract with the J. Walter Thompson Company for car-card advertising.[1]\nThe following month the Skol Company launched a nationwide campaign to promote Skol sunglasses, utilizing newspapers throughout the United\nStates.[2]\n On November 6, 1946, the Skol Company merged with the Gallowhur Chemical Company. Gallowhur maintained his titles as president and treasurer.[6]  The Skol business was\nsold to the J.B. Williams Company in 1948. \n Gallowhur died at the age of 69 at the Miami Heart Institute in Miami, Florida, in March 1974.[3]\n", " Pile weave is a form of textile created by weaving.These fabrics are characterized by a pile, a looped or tufted surface that extends above the foundation or ground weave. The pile is formed by supplemental yarn running in the direction of the length of the fabric (warp pile weave) or the width of the fabric (weft or filling pile weave).[1] Pile weaves include velvet and corduroy fabrics and machine-woven Berber carpets.\n Pile fabrics were originally made on traditional hand looms.  The warp ends that are used for the formation of the pile are woven over metal rods or wires that are inserted in the shed (gap caused by raising alternate threads) during weaving.  Warp pile weaves may also be made on handlooms by winding the pile yarn around a rod during weaving. The pile yarns lie in loops over the inserted rods.  When a rod is extracted the pile yarns remain as loops on top of the base fabric.  The pile ends lying over the rod may be left as 'loop pile', or cut to form 'cut pile' or velvet.\n On power looms the technology of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics.  This weaving technique allows users to obtain both loop pile and cut pile in the same fabric.  Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric on top of each other, whereby the warp ends used for the pile are inserted in such a way that they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric.  By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate pile fabrics.  With this technique only the cut pile effect can be obtained.  This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'.  Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making.\n Knotted pile or knotted weave is the method of weaving used in most rugs. In this technique the rug is woven by creation of knots. A short piece of yarn is tied by hand around two neighboring warp strands creating a knot on the surface of the rug. After each row of knots is created, one or more strands of weft are passed through a complete set of warp strands. Then the knots and the weft strands are beaten with a comb securing the knots in place. A rug can consist of 25 to over 1,000 knots per square inch.\n", " \n Munidopsis serricornis is a species of squat lobster. It is widely distributed in the world's oceans, being found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Iceland and Norway to the Cape Verde Islands), the western Atlantic Ocean (from the United States to the Gulf of Mexico), and the Indo-Pacific (from Australia and the Malay Archipelago to Madagascar).[3] It grows up to a carapace length of 20 millimetres (0.8\u00a0in).[4]\n M. serricornis appears to be one of the most abundant megafauna species in the cold water coral reefs of southern Norway.[5] It has also been observed in association with the gorgonian Acanthogorgia.[6]\n M. serricornis was the first species of the current genus Munidopsis to be described, when Sven Lov\u00e9n described it (as Galathea serricornis) in 1852. It was described independently in 1857 under the name Galathea tridentata by Laurits Esmark.[7]\n", " \n Samuel Pepper[1] (born 26 March[2][3] 1989[4]) is a British YouTube personality, video blogger, comedian, and prankster. Pepper created his YouTube channel in 2010 and holds over 2 million subscribers and 70 million video views as of February 2017.\n Pepper was born in Ashford, Kent. He is of half Greek descent.[5][6] He attended Pent Valley Technology College.[7][8]\n When Sam was 21, in 2010, he was a housemate on the eleventh season of the British reality television series Big Brother. He entered the house on Day 52 as Laura's replacement as part of the \"Ignore the Obvious\" task.[1] He was evicted on Day 73 with 14.6% of the public vote.[9]\n On 8 September 2010, Pepper created his YouTube channel and began uploading videos, mainly consisting of pranks.[10] From late-2013 to mid-2014, Pepper, alongside friend and fellow YouTube personality Marius \"Maz\" Listhrop, began his worldwide comedy tour, \"WDGAF Tour\".[11][12]\n In 2014, Pepper faced controversy after uploading a video titled \"Fake Hand Ass Pinch Prank\". This caused Pepper to face sexual harassment allegations by many women after the video was published. In 2015, Pepper uploaded a video titled \"Killing Best Friend Prank\", which includes a masked Pepper \"shooting\" Colby Brock in front of his friend Sam Golbach, causing further backlash from social media.\n Pepper apologises in his video titled \"i'm sorry\", uploaded on 24 February 2016.[13]\n On 21 February 2016, Pepper made all of his YouTube videos private and deleted all of his tweets except for one stating \"I give up\".[14][15][16][17] He uploaded a 20-minute video on 24 February called \"i'm sorry\". In the video, Pepper confessed that many of his pranks, including his controversial \"Killing Best Friend Prank\", were staged. He also denied all allegations of sexual harassment and rape towards him. He apologised for his fake videos, calling himself an \"idiot\" and stated that he would continue uploading on YouTube and \"make content that [he] really believe[s] in\".[18][13][19][20] After the video was published, Pepper stopped uploading prank videos and began uploading vlogs, subsequently receiving a more positive response.[20][21] In April 2016, Pepper made several of his videos public again.[citation needed]\n In September 2014, Pepper uploaded a controversial video titled \"Fake Hand Ass Pinch Prank\". In the video, Pepper would go up to women and ask for directions before pinching their buttocks.[22][23] Soon after the video was published, many women stated that they had been sexually harassed or raped by Pepper.[24][25][26][27] Subsequently, the hashtag #ReportSamPepper trended on Twitter, along with many people criticising Pepper's actions.[28][29] Pepper released another video a few days later where women would go behind men and pinch their buttocks. On the same day, he published another video explaining that his first prank was a \"social experiment\" and that the video was \"staged and scripted\". He went on to say that sexual harassment was \"the focal point of the experiment\".[30][22] Pepper removed both of these videos from YouTube shortly after their releases.[31][28] Fellow video blogger Laci Green published a video called \"Sam Pepper Exposed\", addressing the sexual harassment allegations to Pepper. Green also wrote an open letter calling on Pepper to \"stop violating women and making them uncomfortable on the street for views\".[24] The letter received more than 100,000 signatures, including many fellow YouTube personalities.[32]\n In November 2015, Pepper uploaded a video entitled \"Killing Best Friend Prank\". The video features internet personalities Sam Golbach and Colby Brock. In the video, a masked Pepper kidnaps Golbach and Brock (the latter of whom was in on the prank alongside Pepper), who are parked at an unknown location, shoving Golbach into the trunk of the car with a bag over his head. Brock helps Pepper tie up Golbach and take him to a rooftop, where he is forced to watch Pepper \"shoot\" Brock, leaving Golbach in tears. The video caused a backlash on social media, also hitting media headlines.[33][34][35][36] British newspaper Metro compared the video to an \"ISIS-style execution\".[37] A subsequent online petition to have Pepper removed from YouTube gained over 100,000 signatures.[35][38] In an interview with Metro, Pepper stated that the criticism towards the video and himself was \"shocking\". In the same interview, Golbach stated that the message of the video was \"about living life to the full... not taking life for granted and loving it because it\u2019s short\".[39] In response to the ongoing criticism, Pepper started a GoFundMe campaign, stating that he would delete his YouTube channel if $1.5 million was pledged to him.[40] The campaign was shortly removed along with the accompanying video that was posted on his YouTube channel.[41]\n", " WSTM-TV, virtual channel 3 (UHF digital channel 24), is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Syracuse, New York, United States. Owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, it is a sister station to low-powered CW affiliate WSTQ-LP (analog channel 14, which WSTM simulcasts on its second digital subchannel); Sinclair also operates CBS affiliate WTVH (channel 5) through joint sales and shared services agreements with owner Granite Broadcasting. The three stations share studios on James Street/NY 290 in the Near Northeast section of Syracuse; WSTM's transmitter is located in the town of Onondaga.\n The station began operations on February 15, 1950 with the call sign WSYR-TV. It was owned by Advance Publications (the Newhouse family's company) along with the Syracuse Post-Standard, Syracuse Herald-Journal, and WSYR radio (AM 570 and FM 94.5, now WYYY). It was Syracuse's second television station, signing on a year and three months after WHEN-TV (now WTVH). It originally had facilities at the Kemper Building in Downtown Syracuse. In 1958, WSYR-AM-FM-TV moved to new studios on James Street. \n Unlike most NBC affiliates in two station markets, WSYR-TV did not take a secondary ABC or DuMont affiliation. WSYR-TV doubled as the NBC affiliate for Binghamton until WINR-TV (now WICZ-TV) signed-on in 1957. The station also operated a satellite station in Elmira until 1980; that station, first known as WSYE-TV and now WETM-TV, is now owned by Nexstar Broadcasting Group and fed via centralcasting facilities of a Syracuse cross-town rival, which ironically now holds the WSYR-TV call letters. It remains affiliated with NBC. \n The Newhouse family largely exited broadcasting in 1980. The WSYR cluster had been grandfathered after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) banned common ownership of newspaper and broadcasting outlets, but lost this protection when Advance dismantled its broadcasting division. Channel 3 was sold to the Times Mirror Company, who changed the television station's calls to WSTM-TV (for Syracuse Times Mirror) on March 28th and kept the James Street studios. Under Times Mirror ownership, WSTM-TV was sister to fellow NBC affiliate WVTM-TV in Birmingham, Alabama (which later became network owned-and-operated and is now owned by Hearst Television) as well as later Fox O&O's KTVI in St. Louis, Missouri, KDFW in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and KTBC in Austin, Texas (KTVI is now owned by Tribune Broadcasting). \n In 1986, Times Mirror sold WSTM-TV to SJL Broadcast Management, a broadcast holding company controlled by George Lilly. SJL then sold WSTM-TV to Federal Broadcasting in 1992. That company was bought out by Raycom Media in 1997. The WSYR-TV calls returned to Syracuse in 2005 after Clear Channel Communications purchased WIXT-TV (formerly WNYS-TV) as part of the Ackerley Group acquisition three years earlier. The company changed WIXT-TV's calls to match WSYR radio, which it had owned for several years. \n On March 5, 1996, WSTM-TV General Manager Charles Bivins died after collapsing at the Syracuse Track and Racquet Club. He was 48 and had previously suffered a mild heart attack two years earlier. Bivins was also a visiting professor at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications teaching television programming. In 2003, Raycom Media purchased Syracuse's low-powered UPN affiliate WAWA-LP from Venture Technologies Group for an undisclosed amount of money. The station had its call letters changed to WSTQ-LP (derived from WSTM-TV) and given the on-air branding of \"UPN 6, The Q\". Raycom used \"6\" to reflect its cable slot as a result of the station becoming offered on the basic lineup of Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) on July 1. \n Before the purchase, Time Warner Cable had refused to carry WAWA-LP. The same \"must-carry\" rules that kept the station off the cable system eventually got WSTQ-LP on. The must-carry rules give full-powered stations the option of \"retransmission consent\" or requiring compensation from cable systems as a condition of carrying a station's signal. In this case, full-powered WSTM-TV can require cable systems like Time Warner Cable to offer WSTQ-LP on their systems as a condition of carrying WSTM-TV. \n On March 27, 2006, Raycom Media announced the sale of WSTM-TV and WSTQ-LP to Barrington Broadcasting. The sale was finalized that August. On March 2, 2009 as a result of low ratings and slow advertising sales, it was announced that WTVH would enter into joint sales and shared service agreements with WSTM-TV.[1][2][3] Initially, WTVH continued to operate out of its own James Street studios a block away but was eventually merged into WSTM-TV's facilities. WTVH was also integrated into WSTM-TV's website.[4] On September 6, 2009, WTVH's transmitter was damaged after a power failure. While Granite Broadcasting worked to fix the signal, WSTM-TV's third digital subchannel carried that station.[5] On September 12, WTVH's signal was restored.[6]\n On February 28, 2013, Barrington Broadcasting announced the sale of its entire group, including WSTM-TV and the SSA for WTVH, to Sinclair Broadcast Group (which announced that it would not renew the SSA with WTVH when it expires in March 2017). To comply with FCC ownership regulations, Sinclair initially announced its intent to transfer the license of its existing Syracuse station, Fox affiliate WSYT, along with WSYT's local marketing agreement with MyNetworkTV affiliate WNYS-TV, to Cunningham Broadcasting.[7] Had the transfer been approved, Sinclair would have continued to effectively own WSYT because nearly all of Cunningham's stock is controlled by trusts in the names of the children of Sinclair's principals. However, in an updated filing that August, Sinclair would instead sell WSYT and the LMA for WNYS-TV to Bristlecone Broadcasting, a company owned by Northwest Broadcasting owner Brian Brady. Following the completion of the sale, Sinclair continued to operate WSYT and WNYS-TV through a transitional services agreement for six months, until May 2014. Those transactions were finalized on November 25.[8]\n Through cable coverage, WSTM-TV serves as the de facto NBC affiliate for the Ithaca/Finger Lakes region of New York State, and provides some news coverage in that area. Previously, it served as the de facto NBC affiliate for Watertown until December 1, 2016 when WVNC-LD signed on as that area's first full-time NBC affiliate.[9] WSTM-TV also carries substantial news stories from Utica and Herkimer County even though that area has its own NBC affiliate WKTV that produces local news. WSTM-TV's analog signal reached parts of Southeastern Ontario and was carried on Cogeco systems in Kingston until February 2009 when it was replaced with Buffalo's WGRZ-TV.[10] WSTM-TV is still (after customer protest) carried on Spectrum systems in Ogdensburg and Gouverneur along with replacement WPTZ out of Plattsburgh.\n The station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n Due to its low-powered status, WSTQ-LP's off-air signal is only attainable in the immediate Syracuse area (northern and eastern boundary is roughly NY 481/Interstate 481; while its southwestern reach is NY 173). Therefore, in order to expand the station's broadcasting radius, WSTQ-LP is simulcast in 720p high definition on WSTM-TV's second digital subchannel.\n WSTM-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009. Two days later, the station's digital signal moved from its pre-transition UHF channel 54, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to UHF channel 24.[12] Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 3.\n Local news offerings on this station originally consisted of ten-minute-long capsules; this effort would not be expanded to thirty-minute full newscasts until the 1960s. For the past two decades, WSTM-TV's newscasts have been second overall in the viewership ratings behind longtime dominant WSYR-TV. As of July 2008, that station remains number one in Central New York for the whole day-part. However, it remains in a tight battle with WSTM-TV for weekday mornings and weeknights at 11. WSYR-TV makes up for this with huge leads during the week at noon, 5, 5:30, and 6. In two periods during its broadcasting history, WSTM-TV has used the popular Action News branding. \n From 1996 until 2000 through a news share agreement, WSTM-TV produced a prime time newscast for Fox affiliate WSYT. Known as Fox 68 News at 10, the broadcast could be seen every night for thirty minutes. After WSTM-TV declined to renew the arrangement, WSYT then partnered with WTVH to keep the broadcasts continuing. Meanwhile, in 2003, WSTM-TV brought back a weeknight prime time news show for newly acquired sister station WSTQ-LP. Although WTVH would terminate its arrangement with WSYT in April 2006, the nightly 10 o'clock broadcasts were WTVH's most successful having soundly beat WSTM-TV's effort on WSTQ-LP.\n After becoming operated by WSTM-TV, WTVH shut down its separate news department and merged it with that of WSTM-TV. This resulted in the elimination of forty jobs at WTVH. Only Michael Benny was retained to anchor by himself the weeknight newscasts on WTVH from its separate studios (less than a block away on James Street from WSTM-TV's facility) using other personalities from WSTM-TV for all other content.[13] The system set up by WTVH to use videotaped footage (including interviews) shot by WSTM-TV presented problems for WSTM-TV staff, who had to walk to WTVH's old studios to deliver raw video for WTVH to edit for its weeknight news programs. Neither station attempted to offer newscasts outside traditional time slots to compete with WSYR-TV (such as weekdays at 11\u00a0a.m., 12:30\u00a0p.m., or weeknights at 4 and 7) despite a plan originally announced.[4][14] However, WSTM-TV eventually expanded WSTQ-LP's weeknight prime time newscast to an hour on August 30, 2010.\n In October 2009, Barrington Broadcasting began to produce separate weeknight newscasts on WTVH from a new secondary set at WSTM-TV's facility. Otherwise, at that time, the CBS and NBC stations would simulcast each other on weekday mornings (except the first hour at 4 a.m. on WSTM-TV), weekdays at noon, and weekend evenings. Although WTVH retained unique branding, music, and graphic aspects of the separately-produced news broadcasts on weeknights, coverage was essentially the same with re-purposed and packaged stories from the NBC affiliate airing on WTVH. WSTM-TV usually featured more live reports from the field during a breaking news event.[15]\n In mid-December 2010, WSTM-TV became the first television station in the market to produce local newscasts in 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen with the shows on WTVH being included in the change. Although not truly high definition, the broadcasts match the aspect ratio of HD television screens. Rival WSYR-TV upgraded to full high definition on January 29, 2011. Initially, only the newscasts seen on the digital cable feed of WSTQ-LP aired in enhanced definition since its over-the-air low-powered analog and digital (on WSTM-DT2) signals remained in pillarboxed 4:3 standard definition. In January 2013, the CW subchannel (WSTM-DT2) was upgraded to high definition allowing the WSTQ-LP shows to be aired terrestrially in widescreen. On October 23, 2016, both WSTM and WTVH became the second and third stations in the Syracuse market to upgrade their newscasts to true HD.\n On April 13, 2015, WTVH reintroduced separately-produced local newscasts airing weekday mornings (from 5 to 7 a.m.) and weekdays at noon (seen for a half-hour) with a dedicated anchor and meteorologist that do not appear on WSTM-TV. At the same time, the CBS station also began to feature its own meteorologist for the weeknight newscasts rather than sharing an on-air personality with WSTM-TV. WTVH already has a separate news anchor seen weeknights exclusively on the station. The CBS station continues to simulcast local news with WSTM-TV on weekend evenings. These broadcasts use the two station's shared branding, CNY Central. There can be a preemption or delay on one channel due to network obligations (most notably sports programming).[16][17]\n WSTM-TV was the first in Syracuse to use Doppler weather radar in 1985 and launched its own system in 2000. This consisted of its own radar at the transmitter site in Onondaga as part of a network including WHEC-TV/SUNY Brockport in the Rochester area and WIVB-TV in Buffalo. However, WIVB-TV and WSTM-TV have since shut down their individual radars. During current weather segments, WSTM-TV features three live NOAA National Weather Service radars in Montague, Binghamton, and Buffalo. On-air, this is known as \"Live Triple Doppler\" and the radar beams are superimposed over the on-screen image.\n", " Alan Dale as Charles WidmoreRebecca Mader as Charlotte LewisKimberley Joseph as Cindy ChandlerSheila Kelley as ZoeMickey Graue as ZackKiersten Havelock as EmmaNeil Hopkins as Liam PaceJodi Lyn O'Keefe as AvaFred Koehler as SeamusChristopher Johnson as Police officerAllen Cole as SergeantMichael Green as Lawyer\n \"Recon\" is the eighth television episode of the American Broadcasting Company's sixth season of the serial drama television series Lost and 111th episode overall.[2] The episode is written by executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and newcomer Jim Galasso and directed by Jack Bender. James \"Sawyer\" Ford is the character the episode is centered on.\n In 2007, The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) tasks James \"Sawyer\" Ford (Josh Holloway) to recon the Ajira Airways Flight 316 plane and passengers. Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) faces an insane Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). In a \"flash-sideways\", Detective James Ford's past issues conflict with his present life.\n The episode received mostly positive reviews, despite it being the lowest-watched episode of the season, with 8.87 million viewers.\n James \"Sawyer\" Ford (Josh Holloway) is a detective for the LAPD, along with his partner Miles Straume (Ken Leung). He is searching for Anthony Cooper, the man who conned his parents, causing his father to kill his mother and then himself (as seen in \"Outlaws\"). He has recently traveled to Australia in his search, telling Miles that he was instead in Palm Springs. Miles arranges for Sawyer to go on a blind date with Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader). The two hit it off rather well. However, after having sex, Charlotte discovers Sawyer's folder containing information on Cooper, leading Sawyer to angrily throw her out. Miles confronts Sawyer the next day for lying about going to Australia and decides to stop being Sawyer's partner. After realizing how lonely he is, Sawyer visits Charlotte, who turns him down. Sawyer decides to open up about his past to Miles, right when a car being driven by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), a fugitive, crashes into his own. He chases her down, leading him to recognize her from their encounter in \"LA X\".\n Following the events of the episode \"Sundown\", The Man in Black (Terry O'Quinn) leads the Others he has recruited, along with Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and Kate, to rendezvous with his other recruit, Sawyer, who is tending to an injured Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). The Man in Black sends Sawyer on a reconnaissance mission to the smaller Hydra Island to spy on the survivors of Ajira Airways Flight 316. Back at the camp, Claire attempts to kill Kate while Sayid watches impassively, forcing The Man in Black to break up the fight. The Man in Black later explains to Kate that he told Claire the Others took Aaron in order to give Claire something to \"hold on to\". He also compares himself to Aaron, stating that his own mother was crazy. Claire later apologizes to Kate and thanks her for taking care of Aaron.\n On the Hydra Island, Sawyer finds all the passengers dead and encounters a woman named Zoe (Sheila Kelley), who claims to be the only remaining survivor of Flight 316. Sawyer realizes she is lying; a cavalcade of armed men appear and escort him to their leader, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who has returned on a submarine. Sawyer makes a deal with Widmore: he will lead the Man in Black into a trap in exchange for safe passage away from the island. Sawyer travels back to the main island and tells the Man in Black about the deal he made, stating that he is loyal to the Man in Black. Sawyer later reveals his true plan to Kate: to turn both sides against each other and escape on the submarine while both sides are distracted.\n This episode is the first to be written by Jim Galasso.\n \"Recon\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 76 out of 100, indicating \"Generally Favorable Reviews\". The score was down on the previous week's score of 92.[3] Jeff Jenson of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the episode positively, commenting that although it often seemed to function as a \"set-up\" episode, it \"really worked for [him]\" due to the return of Sawyer and \"clever, trickster storytelling where every line seemed to have double meaning and so many scenes seemed pregnant with possibilities for what's really going on.\"[4] Raju Mudhar of the Toronto Star agreed that the episode felt like \"mid-game strategic stage setting\", but gave a more negative review than Jensen, deeming Sawyer's off island life \"pretty clich\u00e9 and boring\" and writing: \"The really terrible thing about it is that it started off so promising.\"[5] Sam McPherson of TV Overmind wrote that the episode defied his expectations, but was still less than stellar, preferring the main island storyline to the \"disjointed\" off-island plot. McPherson praised the return of Charlotte, opining that Mader gave a \"fantastic\" performance, and rated the episode \"B+\" overall. He felt that while \"Recon\" had weaknesses in the off-island plot, it was still Lost's best ever Sawyer-centric episode.[6]\n", " Kunto Karap\u00e4\u00e4 (1913\u20131963) was a Finnish stage and film actor.[1]\n \n", " \n Edmund Ironside (c. 990\u00a0\u2013 30 November 1016; Old English: \u0112admund Isernside, Latin: Edmundus; sometimes also known as Edmund II[a]) was King of England from 23 April to 30 November 1016. He was the son of King \u00c6thelred the Unready and his first wife, \u00c6lfgifu of York. Edmund's reign was marred by a war he had inherited from his father; his cognomen \"Ironside\" was given to him \"because of his valour\" in resisting the Danish invasion led by Cnut the Great.[1]\n Edmund was not expected to be King of England; however, by 1014 two elder brothers had died, making him the oldest male heir. His father, \u00c6thelred, was deposed by Sweyn Forkbeard in that same year, but Sweyn died shortly thereafter, paving the way for \u00c6thelred and his family to return to the throne, which they did but not without opposition. In the process they forced Sweyn's son, Cnut, back to Denmark, where he assembled an invasion force to re-conquer England. It would not arrive for another year.\n After regaining the throne, the royal family set about strengthening its hold on the country with the assistance of Eadric Streona (Edmund's brother-in-law). People who had sided with the Danes in 1014 were punished, and some were killed. In one case, two brothers, Morcar and Sigeferth, were killed and their possessions, along with Sigferth's wife, were taken by Edmund. Edmund unofficially became the Earl of the East Midlands and took Ealdgyth for his wife.\n Cnut returned to England in August 1015. Over the next few months, Cnut pillaged most of England. Edmund joined \u00c6thelred to defend London, but \u00c6thelred died on 23 April 1016, making Edmund king. It was not until the summer of 1016 that any serious fighting was done: Edmund fought five battles against the Danes, ending in his defeat on 18 October at the Battle of Assandun, after which they agreed to divide the kingdom, Edmund taking Wessex and Cnut the rest of the country. Edmund died shortly afterwards on 30 November, leaving two sons, Edward and Edmund; however, Cnut became the king of all England, and exiled the remaining members of Edmund's family.\n The exact date of Edmund's birth is unclear, but it could have been no later than 993 when he was a signatory to charters along with his two elder brothers. He was the third of the six sons of King \u00c6thelred the Unready and his first wife, \u00c6lfgifu, who was probably the daughter of Earl Thored of Northumbria. His elder brothers were \u00c6thelstan (died 1014) and Egbert (died c. 1005), and younger ones, Eadred, Eadwig and Edgar.[1]  He had four sisters, Eadgyth (or Edith), \u00c6lfgifu, Wulfhilda, and the Abbess of Wherwell Abbey.  His mother died around 1000,[2] after which his father remarried, this time to Emma of Normandy, who had two sons, Edward the Confessor and Alfred and a daughter Goda.\n \u00c6thelstan and Edmund were close, and they probably felt threatened by Emma's ambitions for her sons.[3] The Life of Edward the Confessor, written fifty years later, claimed that when Emma was pregnant with him, all Englishmen promised that if the child was a boy they would accept him as king.[1] However that claim may just be propaganda.\n When Sweyn Forkbeard seized the throne at the end of 1013 and \u00c6thelred fled to Normandy, the brothers do not appear to have followed him, but stayed in England. \u00c6thelstan died in June 1014 and left Edmund a sword which had belonged to king Offa of Mercia.[1] His will also reflected the close relationship between the brothers and the nobility of the east midlands.[4]\n Sweyn died in February 1014, and the Five Boroughs accepted his son Cnut as king. However, \u00c6thelred returned to England and launched a surprise attack which defeated the Vikings and forced Cnut to flee England. In 1015 Sigeferth (died 1015) and Morcar came to an assembly in Oxford, probably hoping for a royal pardon, but they were murdered by Eadric Streona. King \u00c6thelred then ordered that Sigeferth's widow, Ealdgyth, be seized and brought to Malmesbury Abbey, but Edmund seized and married her in defiance of his father, probably to consolidate his power base in the east midlands.[5] He then received the submission of the people of the Five Boroughs. At the same time, Cnut launched a new invasion of England. In late 1015 Edmund raised an army, possibly assisted by his wife's and mother's links with the midlands and the north, but the Mercians under Eadric Streona joined the West Saxons in submitting to Cnut. In early 1016 the army assembled by Edmund dispersed when \u00c6thelred did not appear to lead it, probably due to illness. Edmund then raised a new army and in conjunction with Earl Uhtred of Northumbria ravaged Eadric Streona's Mercian territories, but when Cnut occupied Northumbria Uhtred submitted to him, only to be killed by Cnut. Edmund went to London.[1]\n \u00c6thelred died on 23 April 1016, and the citizens and councillors in London chose Edmund as king and probably crowned him, while the rest of the Witan, meeting at Southampton, elected Canute.[6] Edmund then mounted a last-ditch effort to revive the defence of England. While the Danes laid siege to London, Edmund headed for Wessex, where the people submitted to him and he gathered an army. He fought inconclusive battles against the Danes and their English supporters at Penselwood in Somerset and Sherston in Wiltshire. He then raised the siege of London, which had been successfully resisted by the citizens,[7] and defeated the Danes near Brentford. They renewed the siege while Edmund went to Wessex to raise further troops, returning to again relieve London, defeat the Danes at Otford, and pursue Cnut into Kent. Eadric Streona now went over to Edmund, but at the decisive Battle of Assandun on 18 October, Eadric and his men fled and Cnut decisively defeated Edmund. There may have been one further battle in the Forest of Dean, after which the two kings, persuaded by the Witan, negotiated a peace dividing the country between them. Edmund received Wessex while Cnut took Mercia and probably Northumbria.[1]\n On 30 November 1016, Edmund died. The location of his death is uncertain though it is generally accepted that it occurred in London, rather than in Oxford where Henry of Huntingdon claimed it to be in his sordid version of events, which included Edmund's murder by suffering multiple stab wounds whilst on a privy tending to a call of nature.[8] Geoffrey Gaimar states a similar occurrence with the weapon being a crossbow, but with a number of other medieval chroniclers including the Encomium Emmae Reginae not mentioning murder, it is thought Edmund's cause of death may possibly have been caused by wounds received in battle or by some disease, but it is certainly a possibility that he was murdered.\n Edmund was buried near his grandfather Edgar at Glastonbury Abbey in Somerset. However the abbey was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, and any remains of a monument or crypt would have been plundered and the location of his remains is unclear.\n In the view of M. K. Lawson, the intensity of Edmund's struggle against the Danes in 1016 is only matched by Alfred the Great's in 871, and contrasts with \u00c6thelred's failure. Edmund's success in raising one army after another suggests that there was little wrong with the organs of government under competent leadership. He was \"probably a highly determined, skilled and indeed inspiring leader of men\". Cnut visited his tomb on the anniversary of his death and laid a cloak decorated with peacocks on it to assist in his salvation, peacocks symbolising resurrection.[1]\n Edmund had two children by Ealdgyth, Edward the Exile and Edmund \u00c6theling. According to John of Worcester, Cnut sent them to Sweden where he probably hoped they would be murdered and forgotten, but Olof, King of Sweden instead forwarded them on to Kiev, where his daughter Ingegerd was the grand princess consort of the Kievan Rus'.  The two boys eventually ended up in Hungary where Edmund died but Edward prospered. Edward \"the Exile\" returned to England in 1057 only to die within a few days of his arrival.[1] His son Edgar the \u00c6theling was briefly proclaimed king after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, but later submitted to William the Conqueror. Edgar would live a long and eventful life; fighting in rebellion against William the Conqueror from 1067\u20131075; fighting alongside the Conqueror's son Robert of Normandy in campaigns in Sicily (1085\u20131087); and accompanying Robert on the First Crusade (1099\u20131103). He was still alive in 1125.\n In 1070 Edward the Exile's daughter, Margaret, became Queen consort to Malcolm III of Scotland. Through her and her descendants, Edmund is the direct ancestor of almost every subsequent Scottish monarch, every English monarch from Henry II onward, and every monarch of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom, down to the present day.[9]\n \n", " Alva Revista Fitch (September 10, 1907 \u2013 November 25, 1989) was a lieutenant general in the United States Army and was deputy director of Defense Intelligence Agency from 1964 to 1966.[1] He commanded an artillery battalion during the Battle of Bataan and was a prisoner of war from 1942 to 1945.

Knopf.\n Correction\u2019s setting is a garret in the middle of an Austrian forest, described by the narrator as the \"thought dungeon\" in which the main character, Roithamer, will pursue his project of constructing an extraordinary habitation, the Cone, as a present for his beloved sister. Roithamer is deeply attached to his sister; this does not, however, prevent his provoking her death, which occurs on the very day that she moves into this conic house that he has built for her with formidable effort, in the Kobernausser forest.  Roithamer has unwittingly killed his sister by forcing her to inhabit a house that was completely contrary to her own nature.\n The Austrian main character Roithamer, lecturer at Cambridge, after years of paroxystic projects, builds for his sister, the only person he ever loved, a house in the shape of a cone, right in the geometrically precise middle of the Kobernausser forest. Her answer to the present is death, her traumatic death on entering the Cone. This cone (see it as you will\u2014a multitude of symbols, such as a refuge, a mausoleum, a phallic icon, the perfect mathematical centre of existence and thought, etc.) is then destined to disappear, absorbed by an invading Nature, eternal nemesis. A typical Bernhardian maniacal character, Roithamer corrects his building project ad infinitum, and ultimately corrects it to its extreme self-correction: suicide. Correction unravels between love and spite, humanity and degradation, hypocrisy and violence, sickness and death, in a crescendo that brings madness to a dramatic threshold of absolute lucidity.\n The first part of the book has the narrator telling Roithamer\u2019s story in the third person; the last part opens with the narrator still nominally telling Roithamer\u2019s story in the third person, but gradually begins to speak directly in Roithamer\u2019s voice, reading portions of his manuscript, where a sort of diary was kept whilst planning and building the Cone. This manuscript was in fact the focus of Roithamer's thousands of corrections, and it becomes apparent that it is being rewritten, \u201ccorrected\u201d once again, this time through the voice of the narrator, who begins, ominously, to disappear into the language of the text. Roithamer\u2019s story becomes increasingly obsessive and mad as it describes the construction of the Cone and the death of his sister. It concludes with the rationalisation of suicide, ending with the sentence, \u201cThe end is no process. Clearing,\u201d and the narrator\u2019s own voice totally dissolved into the text.\n Bernhard used Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s biography to intersperse aspects of Roithamer\u2019s life with similarities and create at times a parallel narration. Wittgenstein was born into great wealth, went to Cambridge, lived austerely, worked obsessively, and spent years carefully designing and building a house for his sister (currently the Bulgarian Cultural Institute in Vienna: Haus Wittgenstein). Other elements of Roithamer come from Bernhard\u2019s own troubled life: his love of the Austrian countryside, his hate of the Austrian state (in his famous will, he prohibited the publication or production of any of his works in Austria), and the bitter relationship with his mother.\n Literary critics often compare Bernhard\u2019s writing with Franz Kafka\u2019s or that of Samuel Beckett. But Bernhard\u2019s style has its own peculiarities, a profoundly innovative form, and a much darker edge. Whilst the characters and situations in Correction are as comical and sometimes as absurd as those of the above two modernists, they are also based on historical reality and a precise geography. As a result, there is a surprising weight and closeness to the existential ground his characters ultimately tread upon. When Bernhard\u2019s satire bends into horror as the novel progresses, there is little allegorical distance for the reader to retreat into. The culminating tragedy feels both personal and claustrophobic.\n", " Fran\u00e7ois Souchon (1787 \u2013 5 April 1857) was a French painter.\n Fran\u00e7ois Souchon was born in Alais, Gard, in 1787.\nIn 1809 he went to Paris to study painting. His father gave him a very small allowance while he was studying.[1]\nHe became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David, the famous painter of historical scenes.[2]\nThrough the influence of M. De Lascour he was able to find work in the houses of several leading personages teaching art to their children.\nThese included Lafayette, Maubourg and Lasteyrie, and Lasteyrie's son-in-law the Antoine Destutt de Tracy. Later he taught in the houses of the Duke of Rovigo, the Prince of San Carlo and Marshall S\u00e9bastiani.[3]\n After the Hundred Days for some time Souchon lost the employment he had enjoyed with the leading families of the First French Empire, but soon after the second Bourbon Restoration he began to find new employment. Through their influence he was commissioned to paint a portrait of King Louis XVIII of France, which was given by the state to the municipality of Alais where it was hung in the council room.[4]\nAfter the coronation of Charles X of France on 29 May 1825 he was one of the artists commissioned to paint large scenes of episodes in the ceremony, in his case the repas royal.[4]\nThe king, princes and nobles who appeared in the picture all visited his studio to pose for their portraits in the painting.[5]\n Souchon was commissioned by the state to paint various other large works in the years that followed, such as a Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, 12 by 8 feet (3.7 by 2.4\u00a0m), in 1824 and a Resurrection of Lazarus, 12 by 8.5 feet (3.7 by 2.6\u00a0m) in 1827.\nSeveral paintings were exhibited in the Salon de Paris.[6]\nHe was a close friend of Xavier Sigalon, who also came to Paris from the Nord department.[7]\nIn 1833 he agreed to assist Sigalon in a huge task that had been assigned by Thiers, to go to Rome to make a copy of Michelangelo's fresco of The Last Judgement for a room in the Palais des beaux-arts.[8]\nThere was a dispute between the two artists, and Souchon returned to Paris. In 1837 he was in his studio on the rue des Orf\u00e8vres working on three tableaux of episodes in the life of Joan of Arc, la Vocation, la Victoire and Martyre.[9]\n Souchon was invited to move to Lille in 1838, to direct the newly founded school of painting there.\nHe was named professor and director of the school on 21 August 1838, a position that came with a good salary and a studio furnished by the city.[10]\nSoon after arriving he made four tableaux for the church of Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ces in Loos, Nord, and several portraits including one of M. Du Bosquiel, mayor of Bondues.[11]\nFran\u00e7ois Souchon died on 5 April 1857 in Lille.[12]\nHis portrait, painted by Alphonse Colas in 1851, hangs in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Lille.[13]\n Some of Souchon's pupils and friends during his Paris years included Narcisse Virgilio D\u00edaz, Honor\u00e9 Daumier and Philippe Auguste Jeanron.[14]\nOne of Souchon's pupils in 1833 was Hyacinthe Besson, who accompanied Souchon to Rome.[15]\nAuguste-Joseph Herlin studied under Souchon in Lille in 1840-48.[16]\nCarolus-Duran (1837\u20131917) studied drawing at the Lille academy under the sculptor Augustin-Phidias Cadet de Beaupr\u00e9, and by the age of fifteen had become an apprentice of Souchon, before moving to Paris in 1853.[17]\nAlphonse Colas was a pupil of Souchon, and became director of the school of painting in Lille in 1855, shortly before Souchon died.[18]\n Diane de Poitiers\n Odalisque facing left\n Louis XVIII in his coronation robes\n Citations\n Sources\n", " Arne Groh (born 1962 in Seghorn, Germany) is a German sculptor living in Kassel, Germany.\n \n \n", " USNS Milford (T\u2011AG\u2011187) was one of 12 ships scheduled to be acquired by the United States Navy in February 1966 and converted into Forward Depot Ships and placed into service with the Military Sea Transport Service, The Greeley Victory (MCV\u2011714) was chosen for this conversion and assigned the name Milford but the program was canceled and the ships were not acquired by the Navy.\n", " Fasito'o Tai is a village situated on the northwest coast of Upolu island in Samoa.

The murders were committed by Huang after the family failed to repay gambling debts.\n The Eight Immortals Restaurant was a Chinese restaurant in the Portuguese colony of Macau. The modest eating establishment was connected to the Eight Immortals Hotel. The restaurant was owned and operated by Zheng Lin, a former street hawker who moved his business from a stand into a formal restaurant in the 1960s. He lived nearby his restaurant with his family, who helped him run his business. The restaurant was a financial success, but Zheng and his wife were noted to be heavy gamblers.[1]\n Huang Zhiheng (sometimes spelled Huang Chih-heng) was born on the Chinese mainland before emigrating to Hong Kong in the 1970s. Huang went by various names during his life, going by Chen Shuliang or Chen Yuliang when in Hong Kong. In 1973 he was involved in a dispute with another man who owed Huang money. The dispute resulted in Huang murdering the other man and fleeing Hong Kong for Guangzhou. After living in Guangzhou for several years, Huang married the daughter of his landlord. The woman's family disapproved of the marriage, so the couple eloped, fleeing to Macau. Before his second leaving of China, Huang burned off his fingertips to avoid being connected to the murder he committed in Hong Kong. In Macau Huang became involved in the local gambling scene, becoming acquainted with the Zhengs in the process. Huang was around 50 years old at the time. \n During one evening of gambling in 1984 Huang and Zheng Lin became involved in a series of high stakes bets against each other. In the end Huang won 180,000 yuan from Zheng and his wife. The Zhengs were unable to pay the debt, so a verbal agreement was made that the Zheng family would cede their restaurant's mortgage to Huang if the debt were not repaid within one year. Huang agreed. However, after one year the Zhengs had failed to repay their debt. Huang later claimed that, not only had the family failed to repay him, they had also continued to lose money to him. In total, he stated that they owed him 600,000 yuan.[2]\n The Eight Immortals murders took place on the night of 4 August 1985. Nine members of the Zheng family were busy inside the restaurant, having earlier closed the establishment for the evening. The Zhengs were last seen alive by a delivery truck driver late in the afternoon. In the evening an angry Huang entered the Eight Immortals Restaurant and demanded that the Zhengs pay him 30,000 yuan (he later claimed that he dropped his demand to 20,000 yuan) of the debt they owed him. He grew increasingly agitated when Zheng Lin refused to turn over ownership of the restaurant. Eventually Huang grew physically aggressive towards the Zhengs, breaking a beer bottle and using the jagged glass that remained as a weapon. He took Zheng Lin's son hostage and forced the other members of the family to bind and gag each other while holding his weapon to the son's neck. Huang later confessed that one family member broke free and started to scream, causing him to stab her in the neck with his weapon. He then preceded to kill (either through strangulation or with his weapon) nine members of the Zheng family. He then briefly left the restaurant to lure one of Zheng's sisters to the restaurant, where he then killed her.[2] He dismembered the bodies over the course of eight hours and wrapped them in black plastic trash bags, which he then dumped into the ocean or threw into dumpsters. He recovered some money and a safe key from Zheng Lin's corpse and left the restaurant, choosing instead to stay the night at the Zheng's nearby residence.[3][1]\n The next morning a delivery truck driver (the same one who had delivered goods to the Zhengs the previous afternoon) found the restaurant locked with a note on the door stating that the restaurant was closed for three days. He visited the Zheng family home, where Huang answered the door, telling the delivery man that the Zheng family had left on a trip to the mainland. On 8 August 1985 a swimmer found eight pieces of human limbs on a nearby beach. It was originally suspected that either smugglers or sharks were involved, but an examination of the limbs revealed that precise cuts had been used to sever them. This finding prompted a police investigation and a search for potential missing persons. Over the next few days forensics determined that the limbs belonged to at least four separate(d) people. A further three body parts were found on Macau's beaches over the following week. These findings generated significant interest in the press, and several theories were raised as to what had happened. The last body parts traceable to the Eight Immortals murders were found in a trash dump in 1989.[3]\n Eventually the Macau police were able to discover that the severed limbs belonged to the Zheng family, who were reported missing by relatives. In the meantime, Huang had reopened and continued to operate the Eight Immortals Restaurant; this was considered unusual but not unwarranted as he was known to associate with the Zheng family and was in possession of the restaurant's ownership documents. He also began collecting rent from the Zheng family's former home. However, Macau police grew suspicious of Huang's activities and began investigating him. When they searched his bank holdings, they found documents belonging to Zheng Lin and student ID cards belonging to the missing Zheng children. Huang attempted to flee Macau for the Chinese mainland, but he was caught and arrested on 28 September 1986. He was charged with the murder of all ten members of the Zheng family, and was convicted on 2 October 1986. Huang's arrest\u00a0\u2013  and the revelation that he had been operating a restaurant for months after dismembering the eatery's former owners\u00a0\u2013  resulted in the urban legend that he had baked his victims into pork buns.[3][2][1]\n Huang was attacked in prison by another inmate the day after his conviction. He was sent to a hospital to convalesce, where he attempted to escape without success. On 6 October he confessed to the murders and detailed to investigators how he had killed the Zheng family. He attempted suicide twice, succeeding the second time on 4 December 1986 by slicing his wrists on a trashcan lid. He left a suicide note and a letter to a local newspaper explaining his actions, stating in his note that his suicide was not due to his acceptance of his sins, but rather to escape his chronic asthma.[3]\n The events surrounding the Eight Immortals Murders were depicted in the 1993 Hong Kong movie The Untold Story. The film featured a fictionalized version of the murder of the Zheng family, and notably played upon the rumors that cannibalism had occurred after the murders. In China the film was also released under the names The Human Pork Bun and Human Meat Roast Pork Buns.[4][5]\n", " \n \"You Ought to Know...\" is the name of a promotional tour single by Phil Collins, which he released during his 1997 Trip into the Light World Tour.

It's the last episode of season 2. It was originally aired on May 25, 2011. The episode was directed by Jim Bagdonas and was written by Paul Corrigan, Brad Walsh & Dan O'Shannon.\n The episode follows the family trying to create a special day for Jay's birthday, while the only he wants is to spend a quiet day fishing. Claire and Mitchell try to recreate a photo of the two of them while they were kids to make a special gift to Jay, Cameron goes to bakery to buy a cake but he gets into trouble, Phil tries to pass Gloria as his wife at the mall when he runs into his college nemesis and the kids try to make a special video as a gift to Jay. Everyone gathers at the house for the birthday, but the dinner ends up a disaster.\n The episode received positive reviews from the critics.\n It is Jay's (Ed O'Neill) birthday and all he desires is to have a quiet birthday while fishing on the lake, but the family misinterpret him as wanting a big celebration. In their frantic scramble to put everything together, all they manage to do is to ruin Jay's day who ends up not going fishing.\n Claire (Julie Bowen) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) want to make a special gift to their dad; recreate a photo of the two of them while they were kids. They dressed up the way they were on the photo (Mitchell is dressed up as a sailor) and they go to their childhood home to take the picture. When they get there, no one is at home so they decide to climb the fence, take the picture and go. While trying to take the picture, the dog of the owners' sees them and they wind up trapped in the back yard. They end up calling Jay to come and help them.\n Meanwhile, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) goes to the bakery to buy a cake for Jay but he gets himself into trouble when people hear him talking on the phone. Manny (Rico Rodriguez) is on the other side of the line asking for advice for a girl he likes. Cameron is telling him what to say and people misinterpret his words, thinking he is talking to an underage girl. While crying he calls Gloria (Sof\u00eda Vergara) to ask her to take the cake but Jay accidentally took her phone so he is the one who ends up going to buy the cake.\n Phil (Ty Burrell) runs into his old college nemesis, Glen (Rob Huebel), while at the mall with Gloria and Lily. When Glen keeps making fun of him, he decides to make him think that Gloria is his wife. Glen gets impressed when he sees Gloria but he tells Phil that he was thinking he got married to Claire and that he was jealous of him back in college because he was dating her. Phil realizes how lucky he is for having Claire and after going back home he tells her all the time.\n Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould) want to do a special gift for their grandfather; a video with all the family talking about Jay and wishing him happy birthday. The material they have though is not the best and Luke says he will edit it to make something awesome.\n At the end of the episode, the whole family is at Jay and Gloria's home for the birthday dinner. Jay's day at the lake is ruined, Stella drops the cake on the floor and the presents Jay gets are not the ones someone was expecting. Luke wants to save the day with the special video but when he plays it no one likes it and it leaves Jay with a headache. Finally, Manny is the one who saves the party who tried to make Jay's wish about fishing come true at the house's pool.\n The episode ends with Mitchell telling Cameron that he wants a second kid. Cameron immediately agrees asking if they could get a boy this time.\n \"The One That Got Away\" was written by Paul Corrigan, Brad Walsh & Dan O'Shannon and was directed by Jim Bagdonas, his first and only credit for the series.[1] This episode was given a rating of TV-14 L.[1] The episode was filmed on March 9[2] and March 10, 2011.[1] The episode also features a guest appearance from Rob Huebel as Glen Whipple, Phil's old college nemesis.[1]\n In its original American broadcast on May 25, 2011, \"The One That Got Away\" was viewed by an estimated 10.31 million households and received a 4.2 rating/11% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49.[3] This means that it was seen by 4.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a slight rise in the ratings from the previous episode \"See You Next Fall\" and stayed flat with the first season finale, \"Family Portrait\".[3] In its timeslot, \"See You Next Fall\" was defeated by Fox reality series, American Idol which received a 9.2 rating/26% share in the 18\u201349 demographic. However, the series defeated a rerun episode of CBS crime drama Criminal Minds which received a 1.4 rating/4% share, a rerun episode of the NBC reality series Minute to Win It which received a 1.0 rating/2% share and the season finale of The CW Television Network reality series America's Next Top Model which received a 0.4 rating/2% share.[3]  \"The One That Got Away\" was the second most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18\u201349 after the Glee finale, and was the seventh most-watched show among all viewers.[4] Added with the DVR viewers, the episode received a 6.2 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic, adding a 2.0 rating to the original viewership.[5]\n \"The One That Got Away\" received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall gave the episode a positive review, complimenting the episode for having an overlapping theme and plot, unlike previous episodes. He also complimented the writers for featuring \"versions of the characters I feel the most affection for\" and for using a plot for Cameron that \"didn't revolve around him being a whiny, overly-sensitive diva\".[6]\n Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club compared the episode to \"Airport 2010\" and \"Hawaii\" and praised the episode's use of Ed O'Neill and for his characters non \"explosive\" reactions to his family planning a birthday party for him. She ultimately gave the episode a B+.[7]\n Despite the positive reviews, many critics suggested that the previous episode, \"See You Next Fall\", would've worked better as the season finale.[6][7]\n At the beginning of the episode, Hayley and Alex are seen watching Lily's commercial from the season 2 episode where Lily starred in a commercial (episode 7, \"Chirp\").\n The short videos of the family members that Alex took in order to create a video montage for Jay's birthday refer each to a specific episode of the season: Hailey in the black cat costume from \"Halloween\" (episode 6), Gloria yelling at the next door's dog from \"Unplugged\" (episode 5), Mitchell practicing the choreography for the flash mob he surprises Cam with in \"Manny Get Your Gun\" (episode 8), Phil with the Bixby's name tag for the improvised Valentine's role play in \"Bixby's Back\" (episode 14), Cam putting on makeup to become Fizbo because he has \"a little girl's birthday party to save\", meaning Lily's \"Princess Party\" (episode 15), Claire getting out with the \"Slow down\" signs she made for the driver of the too fast car from \"Slow Down Your Neighbors\" (episode 11) and Luke with the \"astronaut helmet\" he wore in \"Chirp\" (episode 7) to avoid catching Claire and Hailey's cold, where we also see Phil in the background curse the chirping smoke detector while wearing Claire's apron.\n Also, near the end, Gloria looks for cake candles in the kitchen drawer and finds various objects which have been important in previous episodes: the FrootLoop necklace Manny gave her in \"Mother's Day\" (episode 21), the Baby Jesus that Gloria got from Jay's secretary who misunderstood her when she told her to order \"baby cheeses\" in \"Halloween\" (episode 6), the BB gun that Manny gets from Jay for his birthday and the spare set of Gloria's car keys from \"Manny Get Your Gun\" (episode 8), which led her and Jay to a fight because he said she is too disorganised and lost them while she insisted until the end that somebody broke in and stole them. Yet in this episode she only comments the finding with a \"Ay, I was looking for these keys\".\n", " Go is the twelfth studio album by Christian pop rock band Newsboys, released on October 31, 2006. It is the band's last album with Phil Joel as a member, and is their first (and only full-length studio) album with Paul Colman.\n An EP, entitled Go EP, was released on the iTunes Store as a preview of the album. It featured the songs \"Wherever We Go\", \"Go (I Wanna Send You)\", and \"I Am Free\" from the album. On September 30, 2008, nearly a year after its release, it spawned its own live CD/DVD, Houston We Are GO.\n The album produced one music video for the single, \"Something Beautiful\".\n A live version of \"I Am Free\" (cover of Desperation Band song) was released as a single to radio stations long before the release of the album (early 2006), and peaked at No. 11 on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart, as well as No. 11 on the Hot Christian Adult Contemporary charts.\n The second single, \"Wherever We Go\", was released to radio stations on August 18, 2006, and has peaked at No. 3 on the Hot Christian Songs chart and No. 15 on the Hot Christian Adult Contemporary charts.\n \"Something Beautiful\" was released as the third promotional single for GO in early 2007, and peaked at No. 4 on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart, and at No. 6 on the Hot Christian Adult Contemporary charts. The song also finished at No. 5 on the 2007 year-end chart for Hot Christian Songs.[1]\n \"In Wonder\" was released between late summer and early fall of 2007 as the fourth single to radio to promote the album. It peaked at No. 6 on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart, and No. 5 on the Hot Christian Adult Contemporary charts. It is a new version of a song written in 2004 by New Zealand band Magnify. Rick Knott, lead singer of Magnify, is noted as one of the authors of the track on the Newsboys album. The lyrics on the new song are different from the original song, however, the backing track is nearly identical.\n Reviews were generally positive, especially in the Christian market, where the band was praised for getting back to its original rock roots.  Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and raved \u201cCatchy, fun, worshipful, encouraging, and memorable, GO is liable to cause longtime fans to join me in saying, \u2018Hallelujah, the Newsboys are back!\u2019\u201d CCM Magazine had similar praise to offer, remarking in their review that the band has \"returned in what\u2019s arguably its best creative offering since 1998\u2019s Step Up to the Microphone.

Hex forms solid grey crystals at standard temperature and pressure, is highly toxic, reacts with water, and is corrosive to most metals. The compound reacts mildly with aluminium, forming a thin surface layer of AlF3 that resists any further reaction from the compound.\n Milled uranium ore\u2014U3O8 or \"yellowcake\"\u2014is dissolved in nitric acid, yielding a solution of uranyl nitrate UO2(NO3)2. Pure uranyl nitrate is obtained by solvent extraction, then treated with ammonia to produce ammonium diuranate (\"ADU\", (NH4)2U2O7). Reduction with hydrogen gives UO2, which is converted with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to uranium tetrafluoride, UF4. Oxidation with fluorine yields UF6.\n During nuclear reprocessing, uranium is reacted with chlorine trifluoride to give UF6:\n At atmospheric pressure, it sublimes at 56.5\u00a0\u00b0C.[3]\n The solid state structure was determined by neutron diffraction at 77 K and 293 K.[4][5]\n Ball-and-stick model of the unit cell of uranium hexafluoride[6]\n Bond lengths and angles of gaseous uranium hexafluoride[7]\n It has been shown that uranium hexafluoride is an oxidant[8] and a Lewis acid that is able to bind to fluoride; for instance, the reaction of copper(II) fluoride with uranium hexafluoride in acetonitrile is reported to form copper(II) heptafluorouranate(VI), Cu(UF7)2.[9]\n Polymeric uranium(VI) fluorides containing organic cations have been isolated and characterised by X-ray diffraction.[10]\n UF6 is used in both of the main uranium enrichment methods \u2014 gaseous diffusion and the gas centrifuge method \u2014 because its triple point is at temperature 64.05\u00a0\u00b0C (147\u00a0\u00b0F, 337 K) and only slightly higher than normal atmospheric pressure. Fluorine has only a single naturally occurring stable isotope, so isotopologues of UF6 differ in their molecular weight based solely on the uranium isotope present.[11]\n All the other uranium fluorides are nonvolatile solids that are coordination polymers.\n Gaseous diffusion requires about 60 times as much energy as the gas centrifuge process: gaseous diffusion-produced nuclear fuel produces 25 times more energy than is used in the diffusion process, while centrifuge-produced fuel produces 1,500 times more energy than is used in the centrifuge process.\n In addition to its use in enrichment, uranium hexafluoride has been used in an advanced reprocessing method (fluoride volatility), which was developed in the Czech Republic. In this process, used oxide nuclear fuel is treated with fluorine gas to form a mixture of fluorides. This mixture is then distilled to separate the different classes of material.\n Uranium enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium hexafluoride, or DUF6, as a waste product. The long-term storage of DUF6 presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF6 is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air to produce UO2F2 (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride) both of which are highly corrosive and toxic. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes of DUF6 was housed in 57,122 storage cylinders located near Portsmouth, Ohio; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Paducah, Kentucky.[12][13] Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.[14]\n There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the US, including a cylinder-filling accident and material release at the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation in 1986.[15][16] The U.S. government has been converting DUF6 to solid uranium oxides for disposal.[17] Such disposal of the entire DUF6 inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million.[18]\n Ruptured 14-ton UF6 shipping cylinder. 1 fatality, dozens injured. ~29500\u00a0lbs of material released.

It is the first officially planned neighbourhood of Belgrade in 12 years; the project was started in 2006, and the apartments were used by participants of the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade. The complex consists of 14 residential buildings and 2 commercial buildings, and more than 300 stores, a sales pavilion and a large parking space, covering a total area of 13.8 hectares. The construction investor is the company \"Block 67 Associates\".\n Belville, which means \"beautiful city\" in French, is a common name of residential quarters in France, Canada and the United States.\n Belville is located within Block 67, in New Belgrade. It is bounded by the following streets: Yuri Gagarin Street, Agostinho Neto Street, \u0110or\u0111e Stanojevi\u0107 Street and Spanish Fighters Street.\n Belville covers an area of over 14 hectares and consists of 14 residential buildings and two buildings with office space containing 1,858 apartments of 27 different sizes and areas between 31 and 104 m\u00b2, and 333 shops on the ground floor of residential buildings. The underground parking garage and parking place provide parking space for more than 1,300 cars. Besides, there is outdoor parking space for more than 600 cars. There are two elevators for underground garages in each building.\nInvestor of the Belville construction is the company Block 67 Associates, whose founders are Delta Real Estate and Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank a.d.. The author of the architectural project is Milutin Gec, Eng. Arch., while the other projects were entrusted to Ma\u0161inoprojekt.  The project management and supervision was done by the company Mace doo, founded by the Mace Group. Construction works were performed by the companies Deneza M, Montera, GK Kocic, Eksing, Grading, Gredina, Ratko Mitrovic Dedinje and Integral Banja Luka. \nThe project was started in August 2006, and the construction began in June 2007. The keys to apartments that accommodated the Universiade participants were given in March 2009. Keys were first given to apartment owners on December 8, 2009.\n Delta City shopping mall is in the vicinity of the complex. Each of the residential buildings, ranging in size from 10 to 13 floors, is named after a type of flower: Rose, Tulip, Lily, Lilac, Hyacinth, Cyclamen, Wallflower, Mayflower, Sunflower, Mimosa, Violet, Dandelion, Calendula and Iris.\n The \"University Village\" was planned for use by the participants in the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade. The project was started in August 2006, construction began in June 2007, and in March 2009 the first apartments were ready to be used by participants in the 2009 Summer Universiade. The keys of the first apartments were delivered to their owners on December 8, 2009.\n The neighborhood has three zones: residential, international and free zone. It covers 140,000 square metres and has 2,100 condos that were used by 9,000 sportsmen. Also built within the complex are a computer center, two 10-storeys business towers, a post office, underground garages, hair and beauty salons, a trim trail, etc.\n The city government plans to make the University Village a fully functional residential neighborhood for 6,000 inhabitants after the Universiade, so from 2009 new school, kindergarten, retirement home, etc. are planned to be built too.\n During the 25th Summer Universiade 2009, which was held in Belgrade from 1 until 12 July 2009, the Belville complex accommodated almost 9,000 athletes from 145 countries. \nThe Universiade was officially opened in the Arena Belgrade, and sports competitions were held in Zemun, Pancevo, Obrenovac, Novi Sad, Smederevo and Vrsac. \nBelville was officially opened as a university village on June 24, 2009.\n Part of the terrain on which the Belville was to be built, was a Romany informal settlement. They were moved on an empty lot just west of the Belville. In the next years, the settlement grew, becoming the one with the worst living conditions in the town: no electricity, no water, rats infestation, etc. Inhabitants were constantly illegally tapping on the electricity lines, from any source possible: street lights, traffic signs, neighboring railway facilities, etc., using cables without an insulation dragged through the water. Out of 366 children of the school age, even though it is mandatory by the law, only 20 of them were pupils. It was colloquially named Romville (Rom[any]+[Bel]ville). The settlement was also partially obstructing the construction of the access roads to the newly built Ada Bridge. City tried to relocate the settlers but they refused, gaining support from some NGO\u2019s. After a long stalemate, the city almost forcefully, using the police, first counted the settlers and then relocated them all, 974 persons, in one day, 26 April 2012. City employed 450 communal workers and 110 buses which relocated the inhabitants to Maki\u0161, Jabu\u010dki Rit, Resnik, Dren, Barajevo and Kijevo. Despite the previous skirmish between the settlers and the representatives of the city, the relocation itself was without incident, closely watched by the local inspections and the representatives of the international human rights institutions. At their destinations, settlers were provided with the container houses with running water and electricity.[2][3]\n", " Project Nekton was the codename for a series of very shallow test dives (three of them in Apra Harbor) and also deep-submergence operations in the Pacific Ocean near Guam that ended with the United States Navy-owned research bathyscaphe Trieste entering the Challenger Deep, the deepest surveyed point in the world's oceans.\n The series of eight dives began with two harbor dives, then a Pacific Ocean test dive at Guam, by the newly modified Trieste, which had been modified to dive far deeper than before. After two checkout dives, the first abyssal dive reached a record of 18,150 feet (5,530\u00a0m) on November 15, 1959. The series included a record deep dive to near the bottom of the Nero deep in the Mariana Trench at 24,000 feet (7,300\u00a0m), and finally culminated with a trip to the bottom of the Challenger Deep at 35,797 feet (10,911\u00a0m), on January 23, 1960.[1][2]\n The project name was proposed by oceanographer Dr. Robert S. Dietz in early 1958, as plans to modify the Trieste bathyscaphe to go to the deepest part of the oceans were being contemplated. It is in reference to ocean life that actively swims (nekton) as opposed to the plankton organisms that only drift. The bathyscaphe Trieste to be used for Project Nekton was able to move independently, in contrast to tethered bathyspheres. The Trieste featured two electric motors, each with a propeller, of two horsepower each. These allowed it to move forward, backward and to turn horizontally. A maximum speed of one knot (1.9\u00a0km/h; 1.2\u00a0mph) was attainable over a few miles distance.[3]\n Trieste departed San Diego on October 5, 1959 for Guam aboard the freighter SS Santa Mariana to participate in Project Nekton, a series of very deep dives near Guam, culminating in a descent to the Mariana Trench. It had been modified with a larger gasoline float, larger ballast tubs, and a newly designed heavy pressure sphere (made by Krupp in Germany), after having been purchased by the Office of Naval Research, which undertook the modification.\n The first two test dives in the Nekton series were conducted at Guam in the Apra Harbor, then a third dive off the Western flank of Guam reached 4,900 feet (1,500\u00a0m).\n The next dive, the fourth in the Nekton series, was a very deep dive (dive 61 in a long series of bathyscaphe dives supervised by Jacques Piccard). It reached 18,600 feet (5,700\u00a0m), later recalibrated to 18,150 feet (5,530\u00a0m) depth, to the sea floor, on November 15, 1959. On returning from this dive, some water leakage was noted along the seals between the three sections of the sphere, but since these were held together with pressure at depth, it was not considered serious after re-epoxying.\n Dive 62 (fifth in the Nekton series) was another Apra Harbor dive. The next dive (sixth in the series, dive 63 for Piccard) was another checkout dive on December 18, west of Guam. It reached 5,700 feet (1,700\u00a0m).\n The next dive (dive 64 in a series, seventh in the Nekton series) reached 24,000 feet (7,300\u00a0m) in the Nero Deep in the Mariana Trench 70 miles (110\u00a0km) off Guam. This deep had been discovered in 1899 by the USS Nero in a search for a deep sea cable route to the orient. This dive did not quite reach the bottom, 48 feet (15\u00a0m) below, because too much ballast had been released when the bottom was sounded, and once rising, the bathyscaphe could not be stopped.\n On dive 65 (eighth in the Nekton series), on January 23, 1960, Trieste[2] reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard (son of the boat's designer Auguste Piccard) and Lieutenant Don Walsh, USN. This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 metres (37,799\u00a0ft), although this was later revised to 10,916 metres (35,814\u00a0ft) and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep to be slightly shallower, at 10,911 metres (35,797\u00a0ft).\n The descent to the ocean floor took 4 hours and 48 minutes at a descent rate of 0.914\u00a0m/s (3.29\u00a0km/h; 2.04\u00a0mph).[4][5] After passing 30,000 feet (9,000\u00a0m) one of the outer Plexiglas window panes cracked, shaking the entire vessel.[6] The two men spent barely twenty minutes at the ocean floor, eating chocolate bars to keep their strength. The temperature in the cabin was a mere 45\u00a0\u00b0F (7\u00a0\u00b0C) at the time. While on the bottom at maximum depth, Piccard and Walsh unexpectedly regained the ability to communicate with the surface ship, USS Wandank II, using a sonar/hydrophone voice communications system.[7] At a speed of almost one mile per second (1.6\u00a0km/s) (about five times the speed of sound in air), it took about seven seconds for a voice message to travel from the craft to the surface ship and another seven seconds for answers to return.\n While on the bottom, Piccard and Walsh reported they observed a number of small sole and flounder swimming away, indicating that at least some vertebrate life might withstand the extremes of pressure in any of the Earth's oceans. They noted that the floor of the Challenger Deep consisted of \"diatomaceous ooze\". The ascent to surface took three hours, fifteen minutes.\n The next manned craft to reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep was Deepsea Challenger, on March 25, 2012. A Japanese robotic craft Kaik\u014d reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep in 1995. The Nereus hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) reached the bottom on May 31, 2009.[8]\n", " Osamu Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba \u9577\u6b66, Watanabe Osamu, born on October 21, 1940) is a retired Japanese freestyle wrestler.

She spent four years as a country ship, i.e., sailing in the East Indies but without going to Britain. Then between 1788 and 1803 she made eight voyages to India and China for the EIC. In 1804 the EIC sold Sir Edward Hughes to the British Royal Navy, which commissioned her as a 38-gun frigate. The Navy renamed her Tortoise in 1807 and converted her to a storeship in 1808. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars she became variously a coal depot, a hulk, and then a convict transport. In 1844 she became a receiving ship at Ascension Island. She was lost there in 1859, or broken up there in 1860, or 1863.\n Indian shipwrights built water tanks or cisterns into their vessels that made the use of water butts or casks unnecessary. These tanks were perfectly water tight and saved stowage and manual labour. However, in their designs, the shipwrights did not prioritize sailing speed.[5]\n She was named after Admiral Sir Edward Hughes, the outgoing Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, who retired in 1784. Between 1784 and 1788, Sir Edward Hughes traded locally in India.[2] Thereafter she made nine voyages to China or India, with one to the West Indies under contract to the Navy in between the voyages for the EIC.\n Captain Joseph Smith left Bombay on 21 August 1788. Sir Edward Hughes arrived at Whampoa anchorage on 14 October. Outward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 26 December, reached St Helena on 19 March 1789,  and arrived at the Downs on 17 May.[1]\n Captain Robert Anderson left the Downs on 14 March 1790, reached Madras on 1 July and Penang on 15 August, before arriving at Whampoa on 4 October. Homeward-bound, Sir Edward Hughes crossed the Second Bar on 18 December, reached the Cape on 9 April 1791 and St Helena on 28 April, and arrived at the Downs on 28 June.[1]\n Captain Anderson left Falmouth on 15 February 1792, reached Madras on 9 June, Penang on 29 July, and Malacca on 30 August. They arrived at Whampoa on 26 September. Homeward-bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 26 November, arrived at St Helena on 19 March 1793, and arrived at Portsmouth on 9 June.[1]\n Captain Anderson received a letter of marque on 16 January 1794.[3] However, he did not sail Sir Edward Hughes again. Instead, Captain James Urmston received a letter of marque on 10 May.[3]\n Under Urmston'a command, Sir Edward Hughes left Plymouth on 22 June 1794. She arrived at the Cape on 9 September and Bombay on  1 December. She left Tellicherry  on 18 January 1795, reached St Helena on 18 March, and arrived at the Downs on 23 July.[1]\n In 1796 Sir Edward Hughes sailed as part of Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian's expedition to the West Indies. She carried hospital tents, bedding, and stores.[6]\n[7] After numerous starts aborted by weather issues, the fleet sailed on 20 March to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May.[8] The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and Grenada. Sir Edward Hughes returned to Britain in September 1796.[1]\n Captain Urmston and Sir Edward Hughes left Plymouth 22 February 1797. She reached the Cape on 4 May and arrived at Bombay on 4 July. She then sailed back and forth along the Malabar and Coromandel coasts. She visited Tellicherry (9 October), Cochin (18 October), Anjengo (24 October), Calicut (1 November), Tellicherry (14 November), Calicut (25 November), Cannanore (1 December), Tellicherry (7 December), Cannanore (16 December), and Tellicherry 28 December. She was at Bombay on 9 January 1798. (She had carried Major Lachlan Macquarie, Jonathan Duncan Governor of Bombay, and General Stuart from Calicut to Bombay. By 28 April she had reached the Cape, and by 26 May St Helena. She arrived at the Downs on 2 August.[1]\n Urmston sailed Sir Edward Hughes from Portsmouth on 2 April 1799. She arrived at 23 Jul Bombay on 23 July. She was at Goa on 6 September, Managalore on 18 September, Calicut on 24 September, and Madras on 5 October. She reached the Cape on 30 December and St Helena on 27 January 1800, before arriving at the Downs on 30 May.[1]\n Sir Edward Hughes left Portsmouth on 5 September 1800 and reached Madeira by 23 September. Sir Edward Hughes, Price William Henry, Basket, master, and Hawke, Baker, master, were reported to have been \"all well\" on 11 November at 28\u00b011\u2032S 27\u00b023\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff28.183\u00b0S 27.383\u00b0W\ufeff / -28.183; -27.383.[9] She reached Madras on 29 January 1801. She then visited Masulipatam (23 March), Narsipore (25 March), Coninga (28 March), and Vizagapatam (31 March). She reached the Cape on 12 July and St Helena on 14 August. She arrived at the Downs on 31 October.\n Captain Urmston was still in command of Sir Edward Hughes when she sailed from the Downs on 18 April 1802.[1] She was reported to have been \"all well\" on 5 May at 28\u00b035\u2032N 19\u00b014\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff28.583\u00b0N 19.233\u00b0W\ufeff / 28.583; -19.233.[10] She reached Johanna on 9 August, and arrived at Bombay on 29 August. She visited Surat on 13 October but returned to Bombay by 22 October. She then visited Tellicherry (2 November), Cochin (12 November), Calicut (19 November), Mah\u00e9 (24 November), Tellicherry (25 November), and Managalore (29 November), before returning to Bombay by 8 December. When she left Bombay she again carried Lachlan Macquarie, who was returning to Britain.  Sir Edward Hughes was at Mah\u00e9 on 13 January 1803 and Calicut two days later. She reached the Cape on 5 March and St Helena on 25 March, before arriving back at the Downs on 9 May.[1]\n On her return to Britain, the EIC had Sir Edward Hughes fitted as a frigate. Captain Thomas Barrow received a letter of marque on 3 October 1803. This showed her as having doubled her armament and her complement relative to her service as an Indiaman.[3] Barrow sailed from Portsmouth 26 October 1803 with destination Madras and with the EIC intending her to remain in the Far East.[1]\n On this voyage, she was reported to have been \"all well\" at 40\u00b0N 15\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff40\u00b0N 15\u00b0W\ufeff / 40; -15 on 11 November.[11] On 19 June 1804 she sailed from Madras to Bombay to go into dock to fix leaks.[12] Still, on 12 July, she captured the French slaver Jeune Clementine at 4\u00b018\u2032S 64\u00b00\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff4.300\u00b0S 64.000\u00b0E\ufeff / -4.300; 64.000. Jeune Clementine had a crew of 15 men and was carrying 180 slaves.[13]\n The Royal Navy purchased Sir Edward Hughes in May 1804 in India for \u00a335,000.[4] However, the notice of her capturing Jeune Clementine in July still refers to Sir Edward Hughes as belonging to the EIC. Furthermore, some records state that the EIC presented her to the Navy in 1805.[14][Note 1]\n The Royal Navy commissioned Sir Edward Hughes in 1805 under the command of Commander Hood Christian.[4]  Immediately Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, had her escorting convoys.[16]\n In 1806 Captain Gilbert Heathcote replaced Christian.[4] On 6 June 1806 Sir Edward Hughes escorted Ganges to Bombay as Ganges was leaky and had to interrupt her return to Britain in order to undergo repairs.[17][Note 2] In September Captain Edward Ratsey replaced Heathcote.\n In December Sir Edward Hughes was part of a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Troubridge, in Blenheim, and including Harrier. By 27 March 1807 Sir Edward Hughes was at Madras.[1]\n By April the three warships were at Pulo Aura awaiting four East Indiamen coming from China. On 6 April Blenheim grounded on a sandbank in the Straits of Malacca. It took four days before she could be righted to enable her to return to Penang. Sir Edward Hughes took off her stores, though the heaviest had had to be thrown overboard.[18]\n Sir Edward Hughes was next reported to have been near the Equator on 1 June 1807, escorting a convoy to the Cape.[19]\n On 19 September Sir Edward Hughes and Scorpion were in company and so shared in the proceeds of the capture on that day of the Danish ship Christle.[20]\n Tortoise arrived at Sheerness on 9 October and two days later sailed to Woolwich. There she was put in ordinary in December.[4]\n Sir Edward Hughes was renamed HMS Tortoise on 28 November 1807. Between March and July 1808 Tortoise was at Woolwich being fitted as a storeship for the Royal Navy. In May Commander Thomas Cook recommissioned her. She was in the Mediterranean in 1812 and at Gibraltar in 1813.[4]\n In 2 April 1817 Tortoise was at St Helena. Her captain, Cooke, had an audience with Napoleon.\n Between September and November 1824 Tortoise was at Portsmouth being fitted as a coal depot. She was at Milford until 1838.[4]\n Between January and August Porpoise was at Chatham being fitted for a storeship. James Wood was appointed on 22 May 1841 as master of Tortoise. However, Tortoise's next task was to transport convicts to Van Diemen's Land.\n On 12 August Wood received orders take on convicts, carry them to Van Dieman's Land, and then sail to New Zealand to gather timber and spars for the Navy. Wood had been captain of HMS\u00a0Buffalo when she had wrecked at Mercury Bay off Whitianga in 1840 on an identical mission. The actual task of identifying trees to be cut down, and marking them, was the responsibility of the Navy's Purveyor of Timber, Thomas Laslett, who had accompanied Wood in Buffalo.[21]\n Tortoise departed Plymouth on 26 October and arrived at Hobart on 19 February 1842, having travelled via the Cape.[22] She had embarked 400 male prisoners, of which three were re-landed and three died on the voyage, and so disembarked 394.[23] The 96th Regiment of Foot provided 103 officers and men to serve as the guard force. There were also some 50 soldiers' wives and children on board.\n While Tortoise was at Hobart, HMS\u00a0Beagle, with Charles Darwin on board, came into port. On 9, or 16 March Tortoise left Hobart for New Zealand.\n Tortoise's sailed to the Bay of Islands to gather Kauri wood (Agathis australis) for spars for the Navy. Between 21 March and 19 June, Tortoise succeed in gathering 103 masts along New Zealand's Coromandel Coast. While she was at Te Karo Bay on 6 May, Able Seaman William Sampson drowned in the surf when her jolly boat overturned in the surf. He is buried on land in a grave that the Royal New Zealand Navy still maintains.[24]\n In 1842 Major Bunbury, of the 80th Regiment of Foot, took 40 to 50 men, half of the force he had brought in 1840 to Auckland from Sydney, and launched a punitive expedition against the Te Arawa tribe at Tauranga. Tortoise provided some support for the expedition.[25] She contributed two 18-pounder carronades, 100 round shot, and 50 rounds of canister, as well as sailors and marines. The Acting Governor of New Zealand exercised some mediation and then withdrew his force when he realised that it was too small to prevail and that the M\u0101ori resented the English interfering in their intertribal wars. After the British left, the locals ate some of their prisoners, which is the last recorded incident of this kind in New Zealand. The fortuitous presence of the Tortoise's carronades was essential in giving the expedition gravitas.[26]\n Tortoise's expedition was the third, and last, that the Royal Navy mounted to gather kauri-wood spars. (The first had consisted of HMS Coromandel and HMS Dromedary in 1821.) After her return to Britain in October 1843, Tortoise was at Chatham where between December and March 1844 she underwent fitting out as a receiving ship for Ascension Island.\n Commander Arthur Fleming Morrell sailed Tortoise to Ascension Island in 1844. He had been appointed Administrator of the island.\n On 12 November 1846 Captain Frederick Hutton replaced Morrell in command of Tortoise and as Administrator of Ascension Island.[27] The island was a supply depot for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron, which had the task of suppressing the slave trade. In support of that mission, Tortoise had a ship's tender, Snap.\n In March 1847 fire broke out in the coal Torotise's hold. Her crew and men from the garrison worked for four days and nights before they could clear all the hold and subdue the fire. Even so, her beams were burnt 3 to 5\" through.[28]\n On 19 August 1848, Rapid, Dart, and Snap were in company when they captured the slave vessel Tentador. Tortoise shared Snap's portion of the bounties for the capture.[29] Tentador, of 183 tons, was captured at 6\u00b034\u2032S 12\u00b08\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff6.567\u00b0S 12.133\u00b0E\ufeff / -6.567; 12.133.[30] The Vice admiralty court at St Helena condemned Tentador. She was subsequently destroyed.\n In 1852 William Hewgill Kitchen replaced Hutton. In 1854 Captain William Farquharson Burnett was Captain of Tortoise. Then in 1855 Captain G.A.Seymour replaced Burnett.\n The merchant vessel The Abyssinian, of 1000 tons, arrived at Ascension Island on 16 May 1856 in a sinking state with five feet of water in her hold and the water rising at a rate of two feet an hour. The master and crew were exhausted from pumping and stated that they were going to abandon her. Instead, between 18 May and 22 July 111 men, crew from Tortoise and 24 Africans, removed 800 tons of cargo from The Abyssinian, uncovering the leak, which they fixed. Then over 17 days Tortoise's boats returned the cargo. The master tendered a payment of \u00a3800. She then continued on her journey to London. The salvors took the case to court, which found that value of the salvage was \u00a323,464. The court ruled that given the value of the vessel and cargo, her state, and the amount of effort expended to save the voyage and cargo, \u00a3800 was too little. It awarded them \u00a31,500.[31][32] Shares were allocated in proportion to the number of days each salvor was employed on the occasion.[33]\n Capt. J Elliott replaced Seymour in 1857.\n The fate of Tortoise is a little unclear. The Admiralty issued an order on 18 October 1859 that she be broken up at Ascension Island.[4] However, in 1979 a Royal Navy team of divers searching the waters around Ascension Island for any trace of William Dampier's ship Roebuck, found a number of other wrecks. They identified three: HMS\u00a0Maeander, lost in 1870; Normandie, an iron sailing ship of 1900, and Soudan, lost in 1892. They also found an older wreck that they speculated was Tortoise, which \"broke away from its moorings in 1859\".[34] Other reports have her being broken up at Ascension in 1860,[2] or 1863.[4]\n Notes\n Citations\n References\n This article includes data released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported UK: England & Wales Licence, by the National Maritime Museum, as part of the Warship Histories project\n", " \n Rajiv Kumar (born 2 December 1976) is an Indian former first-class cricketer who played for Bihar and Jharkhand.

Technological advances in aerodynamics, propulsion and aerospace building materials (primarily aluminum alloys) permitted designers to experiment with aeronautical innovations, such as swept wings, delta wings, and area-ruled fuselages. Widespread use of after-burning turbojet engines made these the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier, and the ability to sustain supersonic speeds in level flight became a common capability amongst fighters of this generation.\n Fighter designs also took advantage of new electronics technologies that made effective radars small enough to be carried aboard smaller aircraft. Onboard radars permitted detection of enemy aircraft beyond visual range, thereby improving the handoff of targets by longer-ranged ground-based warning and tracking radars. Similarly, advances in guided missile development allowed air-to-air missiles to begin supplementing the gun as the primary offensive weapon for the first time in fighter history. During this period, passive Infrared homing became commonplace, but early IR missile sensors had poor sensitivity and a very narrow field of view (typically no more than 30\u00b0), which limited their effective use to only close-range, tail-chase engagements. Radar-guided (RF) missiles were introduced as well, but early examples proved unreliable. These semi-active radar homing (SARH) missiles could track and intercept an enemy aircraft \"painted\" by the launching aircraft's onboard radar. Medium- and long-range RF air-to-air missiles promised to open up a new dimension of \"beyond-visual-range\" (BVR) combat, and much effort was placed in further development of this technology.\n The prospect of a potential third world war featuring large mechanized armies and nuclear weapon strikes led to a degree of specialization along two design approaches: interceptors (like the English Electric Lightning and Sukhoi Su-9) and fighter-bombers (such as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the Sukhoi Su-7). Dogfighting, per se, was deemphasized in both cases. The interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond visual ranges. As a result, interceptors were designed with a large missile payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favour of high speed, altitude ceiling and rate of climb. With a primary air defence role, emphasis was placed on the ability to intercept strategic bombers flying at high altitudes. Specialized point-defence interceptors often had limited range and little, if any, ground-attack capabilities. Fighter-bombers could swing between air superiority and ground-attack roles, and were often designed for a high-speed, low-altitude dash to deliver their ordnance. Television- and IR-guided air-to-surface missiles were introduced to augment traditional gravity bombs, and some were also equipped to deliver a nuclear bomb.\n Note: Thrust Dry/Afterburner (in some cases only data for one of the two might be available)\n This generational era also saw the introduction of VTOL aircraft such as:\n \n", " Nakagawara Station (\u4e2d\u5ddd\u539f\u99c5, Nakagawara-eki) is a railway station on the Yunoyama Line in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan, operated by the private railway operator Kintetsu.

She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Far Eastern Studies from the University of Michigan (1967), her Master of Arts in History from Columbia University (1969), and her Juris Doctor from Cornell Law School (1975).\n Before taking her seat on the Southern District, Scheindlin worked as a prosecutor, commercial lawyer, and judge. She was a clerk for federal judge Charles L. Brieant from 1976 to 1977 and, from 1977 to 1981, was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. From 1981 to 1982, she was General Counsel for the New York City Department of Investigation. Starting in 1982, and continuing through 1984, she served as special master in the Agent Orange mass tort litigation. She was an adjunct professor at Brooklyn Law School from 1983 to 1994.

He was a prominent Melbourne barrister before his appointment to the court.\n Starke was born in 1871 in the Victorian gold rush town of Creswick, Victoria, where his father was the Chief Medical Officer of the Creswick Hospital. Dr Anthony George Hayden Starke had emigrated from Honiton in Devon in 1863 to take up the position at the new hospital in this bustling town that then rivalled Ballarat. Hayden Starke was educated at the Scotch College in Melbourne.\n Starke completed a course as an articled clerk in 1892, and was admitted to the Victorian Bar later that year, having won the annual Prize in Law from the Supreme Court of Victoria. He practised as a barrister until he was appointed to the bench of the High Court in 1920. Between 1903 (when the High Court was created) and 1920, he appeared before the court 211 times, more than any other justice of the court.[1]\n Starke was appointed to the High Court in 1920 by the Hughes Government, following the death of Sir Edmund Barton, a foundation member of the court. From 1920 to 1921, he was the Deputy President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.\n Starke was a mentor to John Latham, an Attorney-General of Australia and later Chief Justice of Australia, although there was later friction between them, when Latham was Chief Justice. Starke had a reputation for being upfront and independent. Although it is common practice for the Chief Justice to compose a list of proposals, identifying which justice will hear which case, Starke would regularly arrive and hear cases, often without notice.[2] Starke had a tendency to dissent from the majority opinions offered by the likes of Latham and Owen Dixon. To some extent, commentators have attributed this to personal disagreements with the other justices, as well as his ideological independence.[3] Starke thought that some justices, such as Edward McTiernan, and George Rich, were too heavily under the influence of Owen Dixon, and is said to have referred to them as \"parrots\" and \"worms\".[4] At one stage he was not even on speaking terms with fellow judge H. V. Evatt. Over 60 years after Starke's retirement, Justice Dyson Heydon, in his reasons for allowing an appeal brought by Jayant Patel against manslaughter convictions, noted that Patel's charge sheet listed fraud charges before manslaughter charges and said: \"The young Hayden Starke would have applauded this decision to place important questions of dollars and cents ahead of mere manslaughter matters\".[5]\n In 1939, Starke was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. He resigned from the High Court on 31 January 1950. Starke died in 1958.

At the 2016 census, Kyogle had a population of 2,751 people.[1] It was founded in the 1830s as a lumber camp, and is located 758 kilometres (471\u00a0mi) north of Sydney, 32 kilometres (20\u00a0mi) north of Casino on the Summerland Way close to the Queensland border. It also lies on the banks of the Richmond River. It is the seat of its own shire. Kyogle is an Aboriginal Australian word meaning 'place of the Bush Turkey',[3] a reference to the Australian brushturkey which is indigenous to the region.\n Cattle grazing, dairy farming and forestry are the primary industries.

Parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft put it at a distance of about 150 light-years (45 parsecs) away,[4] but this value is in high error. The system is located within the TW Hydrae association (TWA), and has received the designation TWA 4.[9]\n The system consists of HD 98800 A and HD 98800 B each of which contains two stars. In 2007, a debris disk was discovered orbiting HD 98800 B consisting of two rings which indicates there may be an extrasolar planet orbiting within a distance of 1.5 to 2 astronomical units.\n The system is a member of the TW Hydrae association, a group of young stars. Its membership was derived from the fact that its proper motion is similar to other stars in the group.[9]The system itself is estimated to be around 7-10 million years old.[10]\n HD 98800 is a quadruple system, with two pairs of stars orbiting each other. The two pairs are separated by over an arcsecond,[6] so the wide visual orbit is poorly known. A preliminary range of orbits has been calculated, with an orbital period of 300 to 430 years, as well as a moderate eccentricity of 0.3 to 0.6.[6]\n The primary component, HD 98800 A, is a K-type main-sequence star[3] with a varying radial velocity. This indicates the presence of another star orbiting it, but light from that star cannot be detected, so the system is a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The secondary system, HD 98800 B, is another spectroscopic binary, but double-lined since both stars (another K-type star and a red dwarf) can be directly detected. The stars in the HD 98800 are much larger than would be expected from their masses: at such a young age, these stars have not condensed into their normal size yet.[11]\n An infrared excess indicative of a debris disk was first discovered by IRAS.[12] Further observations of the system have been made using Keck[13] and the Spitzer Space Telescope.[14]  The disk consists of two separate belts. The inner ring extends from a distance of 1.5 to 2 astronomical units from the barycenter of the central binary. The outer ring begins at approximately 5.9 astronomical units from the central binary, and extends out an undetermined distance. The gap between the two rings is ~3 astronomical units. The inner ring is thin, while the inner portion of the outer ring is dense.\n Dr. Elise Furlan, leader of the Spitzer team that imaged this disk, concludes that the dust generated from the collision of rocky objects in the outer belt should eventually migrate toward the inner disk. But because the system is a double binary system, the dust particles do not evenly fill out the inner disk as expected.\n Debris disks are thought to constitute a phase in planetary formation. Because of the gap within the debris disk, the possibility of a planet within the system becomes even more likely. The detected gap could be caused by a unique gravitational relationship between the disk and a possible planet already begun to form, carving out a clear space in the disk. However, the gap could also be gravitational resonance effects of the four stars.\n", " Avranville is a commune in the Vosges department in Grand Est in northeastern France.\n \n", " Tiny Truckers is a children's rail ride operated at Chessington World of Adventures Resort in London.

The first documentation of it came from the New York Times on 4 August 1977.[6] The ESA made its existence more widely known during the upheaval caused by the September 1978 bus fare strikes in Guatemala City. On 18 October 1978, the ESA authored the first of a series of public bulletins containing \"death lists\" of persons which the organization considered to be \"communists\".[7] It claimed to be independent, but was coordinated and staffed by members of the military and security services and was allegedly run by Colonel German Chupina Barahona, Director General of the National Police (PN) from 1978 to 1982.[8][9][10] Often, the lists of targets were provided by the Minister of the Interior, Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz.[6]\n High profile incidents officially attributed to the ESA peaked in Guatemala between 1978 and 1980, and were first directed at academics who were openly involved in progressive politics.[4] One of these cases included the assassination of the President of the Association of University Students (AEU), Oliverio Castaneda de Leon on 20 October 1978, who was submachine-gunned by unknown men approximately one block from the Presidential Palace in Guatemala City, with no intervention from nearby, and heavily armed Policia Nacional. Castenada's name had appeared among others on an ESA death-list bulletin issued two days earlier. His successor as President of the AEU, Antonio Ciani Garcia de Leon, whose name also appeared on the same bulletin, was arrested on 6 November 1978 and \"disappeared.\"[11]\n Among many specific incidents linking the ESA to the state security services, was the attempted assassination on 10 June 1980 of student-leader Victor Manuel Valverth, who was seized at gunpoint at the University of San Carlos by two men in plain-clothes claiming to belong to the ESA. Valverth attempted to flee and was shot several times, but survived. The assailants were tackled and one was killed as troops moved onto the campus to rescue the men from the students. ID cards were found on the two ESA assailants, linking one to the S-2 (military intelligence) section of the \"General Aguilar Santa Maria\" army base at Jutiapa and the other to the (Servicio Especial) Special Service of the Treasury Police.[12]\n As a mechanism for fomenting terror and evading accountability for the assassination program, the government of Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia waged an intensive publicity campaign in which it issued regular statistics to the press on political assassinations and disappearances of persons whom it explicitly labeled \"criminals\" and \"subversives\". National Police spokesmen told the Guatemala City press in 1979 that the ESA had killed 3,252 \"subversives\" between January and October of that year alone.[13]\n Political killings were also carried out in El Salvador in the name of the ESA as well during the height of the internal terror, beginning in 1980 but escalating around 1983. Sources suggest that the ESA was operated primarily by the Salvadorean National Police and was led by detective Edgar Perez Linares.[14] Linares was a key player in the National Police death squad operations run by the chief of intelligence of the National Police, Aristides Marquez. Linares was credited with having captured three leftist guerilla commanders and turned them into a trio of assassins known as the \"little angels\", who systematically murdered clandestine guerillas and collaborators and were instrumental in breaking the back of the FMLN's urban infrastructure.[15] Connections existed between the militaries and the far-right of Guatemala and El Salvador, and at one point El Salvador's National Police chief Col. Reynaldo Lopez Nuila and the director of the Salvadorean police academy visited Guatemala for counterinsurgency advice and had set up links within the security services.[16]\n It is not clear whether the ESA was controlled by state operators or was functioning as an independent paramilitary organization after the end of military rule in Guatemala in 1986. The ESA reemerged in 1988 in Guatemala during a renewed wave of killings and disappearances. The last known attack by the ESA in Guatemala took place on 28 December 1989.[4]\n", " \n Charles James Kennedy Osborne Scott (16 November 1876\u00a0\u2013 2 July 1965) was an English organist and choral conductor who played an important part in developing the performance of choral and polyphonic music in England, especially of early and modern English music.\n Scott was born in Romsey. Educated at Southampton Grammar School, he entered the Brussels Conservatory in 1894. Beginning by studying the violin, he transferred to the organ under the outstanding virtuoso and teacher Alphonse Mailly (1833\u20131918), who encouraged a special interest in plainchant and in the phrasing of Johann Sebastian Bach's organ music: he also studied composition under Hubert Ferdinand Kufferath (1818\u20131896) (a pupil of Mendelssohn's), teacher of counterpoint and fugue, and under the organist-composer Edgar Tinel (1854\u20131912). In 1897 he took the Premier Prix avec distinction and the Mailly Prize for organ playing.\n He settled in London in 1898 as a professional organist and teacher, and married a second cousin who had also studied at Brussels.[1][2]\n In 1904 Scott founded the Oriana Madrigal Society, consisting of 36 voices, which made its first public appearance at the Portman Rooms in July 1905.[3] Its initially stated object was 'to press the claims of our Elizabethan school', and 'to devote itself solely to the singing of English madrigals.'[4] Scott was by chance shown the publications of the Musical Antiquarian Society, including a volume of madrigals by John Wilbye, and formed the determination to lift English Elizabethan music from its position of comparative neglect. He scored many examples over the next years and held gatherings which became the core of his society.[5] Later on the number of voices was increased to 60, and its work was extended to include modern compositions, both English and foreign, but always with emphasis on the English.[6]\n The Oriana Choir brought high standards of precision and flexibility to choral performance, which had a beneficial influence on choral music in general.[7] Their work naturally drew Scott towards the contemporary English scene, and he came to know H. Balfour Gardiner and Arnold Bax, and through them Norman O'Neill, Frederick Delius, Gustav Holst, Percy Grainger, Benjamin Dale, Roger Quilter and others.[8]\n Thus the Oriana gave madrigal concerts in the two series devoted to English contemporary music, of 1912 and 1913, promoted by Gardiner,[9] and in the Philharmonic Society concert of 20 November 1913, under Scott and Balfour Gardiner, which also included part-songs by Charles Villiers Stanford, Gardiner and Hubert Parry.[10] In 1920 they gave the first hearing of Delius's unaccompanied choruses To be Sung of a Summer Night on the Water.[11] In 1922 they sang in a special concert of the works of Arnold Bax, with the Goossens Orchestra,[12] giving the first performance of his motet for double choir Mater ora filium, a work dedicated to Charles Kennedy Scott.[13]\n In 1926 and 1927 the Oriana joined with the Bach Cantata Club for performances of Bach's Mass in B minor: in 1931 they sang works by Bax, Peter Warlock and Holst at a Festival for the International Society of Contemporary Music, and in 1936 they formed the core of a 100-voice chorus for the first London performance of Gabriel Faur\u00e9's Requiem, and for Heinrich Sch\u00fctz's History of the Resurrection under Nadia Boulanger.[14] All of these performances were given at the Queen's Hall, but latterly most Oriana concerts were at the Aeolian Hall, usually three times yearly, and often in collaboration with the English Folk Dance Society.\n In October 1919 Scott founded the Philharmonic Choir, the predecessor of the present London Philharmonic Choir.[15] This first appeared at a Philharmonic Society concert in February 1920, to give the first performance of Delius's A Song of the High Hills, and also Bach's Sing Ye to the Lord and Beethoven's 9th Symphony (directed by Scott, under Albert Coates).[16] Most of its concerts took place in the Queen's Hall, where the space available limited the membership to about 300. The choir contained a large professional element, especially among the tenors, to achieve a high standard of performance: the costs of their employment were met principally by Balfour Gardiner.[17]\n The Choir gave two or three concerts of its own each season under its own conductor, but also made very numerous appearances with the Royal Philharmonic Society, the London Symphony Orchestra, the BBC, and the Courtauld-Sargent Concerts (established 1929). On 25 March 1920 they gave the first performance of Holst's The Hymn of Jesus, the composer conducting: they went on to introduce many modern works to London, including Delius's Requiem and Songs of Farewell, C\u00e9sar Franck's Psyche: St Patrick's Breastplate, Walsinghame and This Worldes Joie by Bax; Requiem Mass by Sir George Henschel; April by Balfour Gardiner; Psalmus Hungaricus of Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly; San Francesco d'Assisi of Malipiero; The Prison by Ethel Smyth; The Canterbury Pilgrims and In Honour of the City by George Dyson; Ode on a Grecian Urn by Philip Napier Miles; Magnificat and Flourish for a Coronation by Ralph Vaughan Williams; Constant Lambert's Summer's Last Will and Testament, Igor Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex, Sergei Rachmaninoff's The Bells and Paul Hindemith's Mathis der Maler.[18]\n The choir was suspended in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II: when the London Philharmonic Choir was formed in 1946 Scott was unable to resume direction, and a new conductor was appointed.[19]\n \nThe choir played a major part with the London Symphony Orchestra in Sir Thomas Beecham's 'revitalisation' of George Frideric Handel's Messiah in December 1926, and undertook much of the choral work in the Delius Festival of 1929.  They gave many performances of the great standard works such as the Mass in B minor, the St Matthew Passion and St John Passion, the Christmas Oratorio, the Requiems of Mozart and Brahms, and many of the Handel oratorios.[20] As an offshoot of the Philharmonic Choir appeared the Junior Philharmonic Choir, consisting of two to three hundred girls and young men from the London Secondary Schools' Festival, who gave several concerts from 1932 onwards in major religious works by Bach.\n Scott created the A Cappella Singers as a small group of 14 professional singers, for singing madrigals and part-songs under chamber-music conditions rather than in the concert hall. It was first assembled in 1922, and gave most of its performances in private houses or for music clubs, though occasionally singing at Queen's Hall in company with other Kennedy Scott choirs.[23]\n In 1914, at the Glastonbury Festival, Scott conducted the first performance of Rutland Boughton's opera The Immortal Hour.[24]\n Also in 1922 Scott founded the Euterpe String Players.[27]\n The Bach Cantata Club was formed in 1926, with the aim of making known the church and secular cantatas of J. S. Bach and his instrumental works, performed with resources similar to those which Bach himself must have planned for when he was composing. In this project Scott was joined by Hubert J. Foss and E. Stanley Roper (organist of the Chapel Royal), and they received assistance from the Bach musicologist Dr Charles Sanford Terry (who contributed programme notes, and gave a lecture on Bach's Chorales and Chorale Preludes in 1927) and from Dr W. G. Whittaker, director of the Newcastle Bach Choir (on which the London Club was partly modelled). The Vice-President was Dr Albert Schweitzer, who from time to time acted as organist at the Society's concerts. The choir of the Club consisted of twenty-five singers, mostly professional, while the instrumental work was an ensemble of London players called the Bach Chamber Orchestra. The choral concerts mostly took place at St. Margaret's, Westminster, and the orchestral performances at the Royal College of Music.[28] A command performance of the unaccompanied motets was given before Their Majesties at Buckingham Palace in 1927, and the Motet 'Jesu Joy and Treasure' was recorded for HMV in the same year.[29]\n On 27 November 1929, at the Annual Extra Meeting, a bicentennial performance of the St Matthew Passion, in English, using Dr Troutbeck's version and rejecting the Elgar-Atkin treatment, was given at Westminster with a 90-minute interval for dinner. The following resources were employed:[30]\n For the grand event of 1930 the Christmas Oratorio was given complete with Dorothy Silk, Margaret Balfour, Henry Wendon and Keith Falkner.\n By this date the Club had held 22 meetings including three performances of the Mass in B Minor (one in St Margaret's Church and one in Queen's Hall), twenty-five Church Cantatas, four Motets, three secular Cantatas, and various composite programmes and instrumental works. The subscription rate was 24 shillings (\u00a31.4s.0d., i.e. \u00a31.20p sterling) for a single seat to five concerts, \u00a32.2s.0d. (two guineas) for a double ticket and \u00a33 for a treble. Single Guest Tickets were 5s.9d. per concert.[31]\n There was a plan to amalgamate all four of the Kennedy choirs in 1939 for a series of 9 concerts illustrating a survey of choral music, but this was abandoned owing to the war.\n Scott was a member of staff of Trinity College of Music, Marylebone, London, from 1929 to 1965. He taught singing, conducted the College Choir, and was involved in the governance of the College. The College holds an archive relating to him, including manuscripts of some choral works, personal notebooks, concert programmes including many for the Oriana Madrigal Society, press cuttings and letters including correspondence received from well-known English composers. The collection also includes programmes from the memorial services of famous musicians which belonged to Kathleen Ewart, a singer in the Phoebus Singers, also a choir conducted by Scott.[34] Scott died, aged 88, in London.\n Charles Kennedy Scott and his wife Mary (n\u00e9e Donaldson) were the parents of the aviator C. W. A. Scott (1903\u20131946) who was famous for winning the MacRobertson Air Race, The Schlesinger African Air Race and holding several England-Australia record solo flights, they also had a son John Kennedy Scott and a daughter Barbara Hamilton Scott, who married Major Leslie Stewart-Brown in October 1926.[35] In 1946 whilst posted at the UNRRA headquarters in Germany his son C.W.A. Scott committed suicide.\n Scott also compiled and wrote two biographies detailing the life of his son C. W. A. Scott the famous aviator, one of the books mainly contains letters he received home from C. W. A. Scott over his entire life, with a biographical context added throughout the book by Charles Kennedy Scott. The other book is a shortened biography written almost solely by C. K. S. Both manuscripts remain unpublished, however, work has been done to digitally copy the hard copy's as part of ongoing work to create the digital back up of the Scott family Archive. this work is being done by James Scott, and Tim Barron who are both Charles's great grandchildren, they also plan to publish an edited version of one of these books at some time in the future once more work has been done to add some extra detail to what will become the publishable biography or life story of C.

It is a medieval European city and a regional center of the Eastern Podolia region (see Bratslav Voivodeship) founded by government of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, which dramatically lost its importance during the 19th-20th centuries. Population: 5,557\u2009(2015 est.)[1]\n The first written mention of Bratslav dates back to 1362. City status was granted Magdeburg Rights in 1564. Bratslav belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Lublin Union of 1569, when it became a voivodeship center in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n In the early 16th century, the Starosta of Bratslav and Vinnytsia (Winnica) was Hetman Kostiantyn Ostrozky, who commanded Polish-Lithuanian army in the Battle of Orsha. Nevertheless, Ostrozky was unable to protect Bratslav and its castle from destruction in 1497, when the town was raided by Crimean Tatars. The castle was rebuilt and reinforced by order of Polish King Alexander I Jagiellon, but it was destroyed once again, in 1551, during a Tatar raid commanded by Khan Devlet I Giray, after which Bratslav turned into a desert.\n In 1564, Bratslav was granted Magdeburg rights, and five years later, following the Union of Lublin, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland, becoming capital of the Bratslav Voivodeship, which existed for over 200 years. During this time, Bratslav (then named Brac\u0142aw in Polish) by the authorities, was property of Polish kings, and was ruled by the starostas.\n In 1570, a special commission of the Polish Sejm marked boundaries of the Bratslav Voivodeship. In the west, it reached the Dniestr and the Murachwa rivers, in the north it went along the so-called Black Tatar Trail. With top-quality soil, the so-called chernozem, Brac\u0142aw Voivodeship was the most fertile region of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1589 in Warsaw, the Sejm granted coat of arms to the town: a cross in red field, with blue shield in the middle. In 1598, Polish Parliamend decided to move the seat of local courts and sejmiks from Bratslav to Vinnytsia, and as a result, Winnica became a de facto capital of the voivodeship, even though it was still named after Brac\u0142aw.\n On October 5, 1594, Zaporozhian Cossacks under Severyn Nalyvaiko murdered near Bratslav Castle a tabor of the local Polish nobility, who tried to escape the Nalyvaiko Uprising. In 1648, during the Bohdan Khmelnytsky rebellion, Brac\u0142aw became a Cossack regimental city, part of the Ukrainian Hetman state, which was later assimilated by the Duchy of Muscovy. In 1667, under the Treaty of Andrusiv, Muscovy returned the city to Poland. The city was ruled by Ottoman Empire between 1672-1699, returning then to Poland once more. It became part of the Russian Empire (the new name of Muscovy since 1708) after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, along with the rest of the formerly Polish Right-bank Ukraine. Under Russia, Bratslav was an uyezd (district) center in the Podolia governorate. As the city had no access to a railroad, its importance and population gradually declined.\n Bratslav is famous in Judaism as the place where Rabbi Nachman lived and taught between 1802 and 1810. Rabbi Nachman was the founder of one of the major branches of Hasidism, Breslover Hasidism, and an author of Jewish mystical works. After the 1917 revolution Judaism had been strongly persecuted. The history of this persecution is well illustrated by the life of Bratslav rabbi Moishe Yankel Rabinovich who served as a rabbi from 1919 to 1968.[3]\n In 1926 Bratslav had a population of 7,842 (Source=Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer).\n During World War II, Bratslav was occupied by German and Romanian armies on July 22, 1941, and was made into a ghetto for Jews of Bratslav and its vicinities.

The Macau government also began to collect taxes from the populations of these three islands in exchange for protection as these islands were not protected by Chinese soldiers. The Portuguese built a leper colony on the island of Dom Jo\u00e3o and some schools to educate the few Chinese residents on the islands.\n Followed by the Japanese invasion of China in 1938, the Portuguese officially occupied these three islands, with an excuse to better protect Portuguese missionaries residing there.

It was founded in March\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-03),[1][2] and provides cloud computing service, provided from ten data centres;[3][4] in the United Kingdom (two sites), Netherlands, United States (four sites), Canada, Hong Kong and Australia.\n ElasticHosts is privately held and competes with other public cloud-infrastructure providers such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Rackspace Cloud.[5][6]\nAccording to CEO Richard Davies, the company aims to provide servers that are set up as similar as possible to how one would provision dedicated hosting, with the exception that the customer can self-serve at any time.[7]\n ElasticHosts' EU hosting data centres are in the UK and not Ireland. It is the first public [8] cloud service built on Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (rather than Xen), and it has an API that has been given a good review from a REST perspective.[9] It charges for resources (CPU, memory, disk and network) as separate entities, allowing customers to build virtual machines with widely different characteristics instead of simply categorized ones, such as small, medium and large instances.[10]\n ElasticHosts (and therefore licensees) are supported directly by BoxGrinder included in Fedora 15 as of May 2011.[11][12][13]\n ElasticHosts Cloud Servers are available from ten data centres; San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Maidenhead (UK), Portsmouth (UK), Amsterdam, Toronto, Hong Kong and Sydney.\n ElasticHosts only has persistent storage, based on local host store. However, in 2012 it announced solid-state drives (SSD) for all instance sizes.[15] It does not use a storage area network, but instead has directly attached RAID arrays, with iSCSI interconnects between hosts.[citation needed]\nIn 2011 the CEO predicted a greater demand for storage.[16]\n ElasticHosts has two types of IPv4 addresses - static and dynamic. Both are allocated from the same pools of addresses, but static addresses are kept by the account, and can be allocated to any account's server at any time. Dynamic ones are randomly allocated for any server that has not been specifically allocated a static IP address. These are not guaranteed to remain the same, though remain for the lifespan of the instance. A shutdown of the virtual machine may or may not reallocate the IP address. ElasticHosts does not lock a static IP to a server instance - they can be reallocated from the control panel. Reverse DNS is managed by the customer from the control panel.[17]\n Elastichosts announced on 14 April 2014 that in addition to maintaining their traditional cloud VM business, they were releasing an alternate type of server, based on linux running within containers. This implementation, similar to chroot or BSD jails uses the more advanced Linux kernel Control Groups feature, which the company deemed mature enough to use as the basis for a new type of cloud server, launched under the name \"Elastic Containers\".[18] Claiming this as a world first in terms of virtualization, the company currently offers versions of Debian, Ubuntu and Centos - though because of the nature of the containers, all run with the host's Linux kernel. Containers in and of themselves are not a new technology, with the cgroups features first begun being added to the Linux kernel in 2007; and other companies such as Docker Inc. producing software that uses them to virtualize applications; this is claimed as the first time an IaaS provider has used the technology for full operating system use.\n Various press articles focused on the newly released pay as you go billing option, whereby the container can optionally be billed for actual usage, as opposed to some fixed instance size, in 15 minute increments; where the common industry standard is 1 hour time blocks for cloud server rentals.[19][20] In particular the CEO's claim that customers could save up to 50% on traditional costs using the service.[21] Some analysts expressed confidence that container based systems had to be the future for cloud providers; \"Given the fiercely competitive nature of cloud pricing these days, it\u2019s hard to see how containers won\u2019t become a dominant mechanism for delivering cloud services.\"[22] though others wondered whether this would actually pull customers from the dominating players in the market - Owen Rogers, senior analyst for digital economics at 451 Research, noted that though the \u201cinteresting and unique\u201d  model did give Elastichosts an advantage, with the \"... rest of the market ... still based on virtual machines, and I can\u00b9t see this changing overnight\u201d; but wondered whether \"... consumers really care about ElasticHosts\u2019 more detailed \u2013 and arguably fairer \u2013 method of pricing, when its bigger competitors are slashing prices\" [23]\n ElasticHosts was acquired by Paragon Internet Group in April 2016.[24] Paragon itself was acquired by Host Europe Group in late 2015.[25]  Host Europe Group was acquired by GoDaddy in December 2016,[26] meaning that ElasticHosts is ultimately a subsidiary of GoDaddy.\n", " North Beach is a residential area in central Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.\n \n", " Front Mission 2 (\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 \u30bb\u30ab\u30f3\u30c9, Furonto Misshon Sekando) is a tactical role-playing game for the Sony PlayStation developed by G-Craft and published by Squaresoft, and was released in Japan on September 25, 1997.[2] Front Mission 2 is the second main entry and the third entry overall in the Front Mission series.[3]  Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission 2 is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.[4] The game was well received by critics and fans, and was part of Square Enix's \"Ultimate Hits\" collection in 2005.\n Front Mission 2 uses 3D models and a moving camera.[5]\n Front Mission 2 expands on the mechanics found in Front Mission. The video game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up their wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a point-and-click world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. Battle zones are where the missions take place, though they become inaccessible upon the completion of a mission. A new element of progression in Front Mission 2 involves alternating scenarios between the game's three main characters. After reaching a certain point of the game, control switches over to a different group of characters for the next few missions. Towards the climax, all three scenarios merge for the remainder of Front Mission 2.[6]\n Front Mission 2 missions are traditional tactical RPG fare, ranging from destroying all enemy targets to protecting a certain allied target. There are a number of new main features that are used for mission play in Front Mission 2. Action Points (AP) is a feature that dictates how much actions can be done with each unit. Actions such as moving and attacking require a certain amount of AP to use. At the end of a full turn, which is one Player Phase and Enemy Phase, a set amount of AP is replenished. A unit's AP amount and recharge value increases as their pilots gain proficiency levels through destroying enemy targets. The Action Points feature ties into a second feature known as Honor. Moving around while allied units are nearby can result in statistical advantages such as increased AP charge or accuracy. In contrast, being surrounded by enemy units will result in statistical disadvantages such as decreased evasion or AP charge. By destroying enemy targets, a unit's pilot can gain Honor Points.\n When enough Honor Points are accumulated, the aforementioned pilot will learn abilities that provide special benefits or detriments to nearby allied or enemy units; one of these abilities is Links. Links is a unique ability that allows multiple units to provide defensive support to each other during Enemy Phase battles. Up to two units can be linked together to form one \"link\". For linked actions, only melee weapons and short-range weapons can be used during a linked battle. As long as the linked units are within an eight-square radius of each other, they can participate in linked battles. Furthermore, the target of an enemy unit is protected entirely from their attack; the linked unit is hit by the attack instead during linked battles. Other new features for mission play include armor coating and flanking. Armor coating allows a unit to resist certain types of attacks, while flanking improves a unit's chances at hitting an enemy target.\n Missions aside, there are several returning features from Front Mission that are expanded upon Front Mission 2. The Arena feature returns, which allows players to fight against the AI or against another player for monetary rewards. A new addition to the Arena is team matches, in which the player can field more than one wanzer to do battle with an opposing team. Briefings are also retained, and now operate differently. Instead of providing basic information on the enemy, briefings allow the player to review battle maps - enemy placements, allied units, and player starting positions can all be seen. Returning features aside, Front Mission 2 introduces the Network - a pseudo-Internet feature that allows the player to better understand the world of Front Mission through various websites and web pages.\n The story takes place 12 years after Front Mission 1st.[5] Set in June 2102, the game's story of takes place in Alordesh (modern-day Bangladesh), a member state for the Oceania Cooperative Union (OCU).[6] The formation of the OCU in the early 21st century led to rapid industrialization of developing countries such as Bangladesh. During the 1st Huffman Conflict in 2070, Bangladesh's economic growth flourishes with the OCU because of many war factories in the country. However, the economic boom begins to slow down in 2080, with a loss of foreign investments and pullout of several businesses. Five years later, the OCU offers to provide Bangladesh with foreign aid, provided it joins the union. The Bangladeshi economy resurges briefly during the 2nd Huffman Conflict. Anti-OCU sentiments grew after the war and in 2094, Bangladesh renames itself as the \"People's Republic of Alordesh\".[7] Four years later, the Alordeshi military, the Forces of Alordesh, staged a coup d'\u00e9tat. While the coup failed, it further increased anti-OCU support and led to a second coup in 2102.\n The plot of Front Mission 2 revolves around three individuals from the OCU - Corporal Ash Faruk, Captain Thomas Norland, and intelligence officer Lisa Stanley. On June 12, 2102, the Forces of Alordesh declares independence from the OCU. Through a well-orchestrated plan, Alordeshi troops overwhelm OCU forces at their military bases in the country while overthrowing the government. In the midst of the chaos, Ash Faruk and members of the Muddy Otters unit attempt to flee the country. Along the way, they come across some OCU survivors led by Thomas Norland of the Dull Stags unit. Thomas leads the survivors to the estate of Saribash Labra, the CEO of the transport business Burg Transportation. Saribash offers to help them escape by the seashore, the only part of Alordesh not controlled by the coup d'\u00e9tat forces. As the survivors head for the seashore, an OCU regiment lands in the country. Tasked with freeing POWs, Stanley leads a small unit to investigate the movements of the coup d'\u00e9tat forces.\n Upon intercepting a transport helicopter, she learns of a detention center where OCU POWs are being held. Lisa succeeds in liberating the inmates and begins preparing for an operation to rescue Alordeshi government officials in Dhaka. A major battle breaks out in the city. The operation succeeds with some help from Thomas and his subordinates, who opted to stay in the country and fight the coup forces. Meanwhile, aboard the OCU aircraft carrier Monto, Ash is confronted by an officer from the OCU's Central Intelligence Unit. He reluctantly agrees to return to the country when the officer, Pike Reischauer, reveals that some of his colleagues in the Muddy Otters are still alive. Upon returning to Alordesh, they are pursued by coup leader Ven Mackarge. A link between Ven's pursuit of them, the OCU's liberation attempts, and Burg Transportation's involvement in the war is eventually formed when it is revealed that the Forces of Alordesh are receiving support from an unknown third party, and are in possession of a device codenamed \"FENRIR\".\n Front Mission 2 was composed by Noriko Matsueda, who also composed the original Front Mission. The Front Mission 2 Original Soundtrack was released by DigiCube on September 21, 1997 on a single 43-track disc.[8]\n According to the series' public relations manager Koichiro Sakamoto, the game was never released outside Japan due to the presence of situations and vocabulary which would be considered faux pas in North America.[9]\n Front Mission 2 was both a financial and critical success in Japan. The game sold 496,200 copies, making it the 18th best-selling game of 1997.[10][11]\n The game was also later re-released alongside both Front Mission and Front Mission 3 as part of the Front Mission History compilation. This version included a Quick Battle option that allows players to progress through the game's story at a faster pace.[12]\n Famitsu magazine awarded the game 32 out of 40 upon its release.[2][18] The magazine chose the game as the number 63rd best game on the original PlayStation.[19] At the time of the re-release of Front Mission 2 under the Ultimate Hits line on October 5, 2006, the game sold over 510,000 copies in Japan.[6]\n Front Mission 2 has been criticized for its long loading times,[5] causing a player to wait over 10 seconds for a battle sequence to begin, something which could happen nearly a hundred times in a battle.[citation needed] A workaround for this technical flaw was added in the Ultimate Hits version of the game, which enables the ability to skip battle sequences.[20][13]\n", " \n James Macpherson Grant (1822 \u2013 1 April 1885)[1] \nwas an Australian solicitor who defended the Eureka Stockade rebels and a politician who was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly and the Victorian Legislative Council.\n Grant was born at Alvie, Inverness-shire, Scotland,[2] son of Louis Grant and his wife Isabella, n\u00e9e McBean. He obtained some schooling at Kingdenie[2] and emigrated to Sydney with his parents in 1836 and was articled to Chambers and Thurlow, solicitors.[2] In 1844 he paid a visit to New Zealand and served as a volunteer in the Flagstaff War against the M\u0101oris. Returning to Australia he was admitted to practise as an attorney and solicitor in 1847, and became a partner of Mr Thurlow.[2] In 1850, with a partner, he chartered a vessel and took supplies to California, and in June 1851 was still at San Francisco. Grant returned to Australia on receiving news of the discovery of gold in Victoria and in 1853 was a successful miner at Bendigo, Victoria.[2] He was practising as a solicitor at Melbourne in 1854, and showed much sympathy for the diggers (miners) at the time of the Eureka rebellion in December 1854. The mayor of Melbourne, John Thomas Smith, had called a meeting at the town hall to concert measures for keeping law and order. Grant and Dr J. H. Owens issued a placard asking the public not to go to the town hall, but to attend an open air meeting on the present site of St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. About 5000 people attended. Grant was one of the speakers and a committee was appointed to interview the governor. At the trial of the Ballarat miners Grant acted as their attorney without fee.[2]\n In 1855 Grant was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Sandhurst,[1] and when responsible government was established in 1856, was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly for Sandhurst Boroughs (based around current Bendigo).[1] Grant did not stand at the 1859 Sandhurst Boroughs election, but, in October 1959, was elected for Avoca and held this seat until his death.[1] Grant joined the Richard Heales ministry in February 1861 as vice-president of the board of land and works and commissioner of public works, and resigned with Heales in November. Grant was commissioner for railways in the James McCulloch ministry from June 1863 to September 1864 and then became president of the board of lands and works and commissioner of crown lands and survey from September 1864 to May 1868. In 1865 Grant succeeded in passing a land act which promised to be little more successful than previous acts, the conditions being too exacting for poor men. One clause, however, which had been meant to apply to goldfield areas, allowed selectors to take up 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) at a rental of two shillings an acre. Grant interpreted this very liberally and many applicants were allowed to hold four licences and thus farms of 80 acres (32\u00a0ha) were established. However, in May 1869, Grant brought in a new land bill which allowed the selection of up to 320 acres (1.3\u00a0km2) with conditions of residence, cultivation and improvement at a yearly payment of two shillings an acre, with liberal terms to convert into freehold. Grant was then holding the same position in the second McCulloch ministry as in the previous one, and went out of office in September 1869. The act, however, came into force on 1 February 1870 and, though amended by later governments, was the basis of all subsequent land settlement in Victoria. Grant earned great popularity from it, and was afterwards presented with a testimonial of \u00a33000 raised by public subscription. He again held the lands portfolio in the Charles Duffy ministry from June 1871 to June 1872, was minister of justice in the first Graham Berry ministry for a few weeks in 1875, held the same position in the second Berry ministry from May 1877 to March 1880, and was chief secretary and minister of public instruction in the Bryan O'Loghlen ministry from July 1881 to March 1883. He was able to do valuable work at the education department by insisting on the importance of merit in considering promotions. Grant had a stroke of paralysis in November 1884 and died on 1 April 1885, leaving a widow, a son and three daughters. Grant was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery after a service at Elsternwick Presbyterian Church. A grant of \u00a34000 was subsequently voted by parliament to his family.\n Grant was regarded as having a genial nature and was generally liked. Although not a great orator, Grant had a clear grasp of questions which commanded attention and was also a thorough and hard-working administrator. His land act cleared up what seemed to be an almost hopeless position, and had great influence in the development of Victoria.\n", " \n The Nuggets is a close group of four granite islets, with a combined area of 6.76 hectares (16.7 acres), in south-eastern Australia.

Cowman, was an American writer and author of the devotional books Streams in the Desert and Springs in the Valley. Cowman published her books under the author name Mrs. Charles E. Cowman. She was also one of the cofounders of The Oriental Missionary Society (later known as OMS International, and eventually One Mission Society).\n Lettie Burd Cowman was born on March 3, 1870, in Afton, Iowa to Isaac and Margaret Burd. At 13 years of age, she met her future husband, Charles Cowman, a young telegraph operator. Six years later, on June 8, 1889, they were married. Charles was also one of the co-founders of The Oriental Missionary Society. Lettie and Charles lived in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, for the first year of their marriage. After living there for a year, the high altitude of the Rocky Mountains caused Lettie to become very ill. They were forced to move back to Chicago, where they lived for the next 10 years. While there, Charles worked at the same telegraph office where he had previously worked.[1]\n On February 1, 1901, the Cowmans left the United States to work as missionaries in Japan.[1] They worked alongside Juji Nakada, a friend they had met at their church in Chicago. In 1902, a friend from the telegraph office, Ernest Kilbourne, joined them to aid their growing ministry. The Cowmans, Nakada, and Kilbourne are considered the four cofounders of the Oriental Missionary Society.\n The work in Japan continued to grow. By 1903, two Bible Training Institutes had opened in Japan. These schools held classes during the day, and in the evening hosted evangelical services open to the public. Dozens flooded in nightly to hear the preaching of Juji Nakada. A Bible Training Institute was open in Seoul in 1910.[1]\n It was clear that all four co-founders had a deep burden on their heart for the people of Japan. They wanted to reach as many people as they could with the Gospel. Although they were making huge strides in their goals, Charles was not satisfied. This led to the start of the Great Village Campaign in 1913. His goal was for every person in Japan to hear the Gospel within the next five years. Teams of missionaries went to every town, village and home throughout Japan, proclaiming the Gospel and distributing Bibles. When Charles' health took a turn downward in 1917, he and Lettie were forced to return to America. In January 1918, they received news through the O.M.S. Standard that the Great Village Campaign was complete. About 60 million Japanese were equipped with the Gospel, covering 161,000 square miles (420,000\u00a0km2) of land.[1]\n Cowman began writing in November 1902 when OMS co-founder Ernest Kilbourne initiated a monthly publication called Electric Messages.'. She wrote monthly reports of the work being accomplished. These reports were then mailed to supporters in the United States. The name was later changed to The O.M.S. Standard, and is currently named OMS Outreach.[1]\n After the Cowmans returned to the United States in January 1918, Charles' health continued to decline. As he suffered in pain, Lettie suffered, watching her husband slowly fade away. During this time, her best-selling devotional book, Streams in the Desert, was conceived. Lettie wrote a daily devotional based on her hardships and her experiences of fellowship with God. Each daily section contains a Bible passage and a quote from another author. The title of the book comes from Isaiah 35:6, \"Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.\"[2] No one expected Streams to be as successful as it was. Cowman was not seeking success during the time she wrote it. When the book was being printed, her publisher was certain they would never publish more than the original printing of 3,000. Yet, many readers found they could connect with Streams because it \"spoke to those who had difficulty relating their own sufferings to the noble and eternal purposes of a loving and all-wise God.\"[2] Cowman often stated, \"I did not write Streams. God gave me Streams.\"[3]\n Charles died in September 1924. After his death, Lettie found a note addressed to her in his Bible, stating, \"Go on with my unfinished task.\"[3] Despite her grieving, she knew that she had work to complete. The year following her husband's death, Cowman wrote Missionary Warrior, a biography of Charles Cowman's life. In writing this, she hoped that \"a world-wide crusade [would] be launched to reach every living member of this generation with the gospel.\"[3] After Charles' death, OMS' work continued with co-founder E.A. Kilbourne as the organization's second President. Lettie continued serving with OMS as one of the co-founders. When Kilbourne died four years after Charles, Lettie became the third President of OMS.\n In the midst of her new writing career, Lettie continued serving as President of OMS as her first priority. She was determined to carry out the Every Creature Crusade (now known as Every Community for Christ), which Charles started in Japan as the Great Village Campaign. She began speaking at camp meetings and conventions. Just as Charles felt such a strong calling to proclaim the Gospel to every individual in Japan, Lettie felt a similar call to distribute the Gospel to all the nations. They had already been to Japan, Korea, and China, so they began to make plans to go to India, Africa, South America, Europe; all the nations of the earth.[3] In Europe, they expanded into countries such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. This crusade marked one of the last great evangelistic efforts in Europe before Nazi Germany took control. In Africa, Egypt was a country for which Lettie felt a great burden.[3] In North America, Cuba was a country of focus (Page 130).[3] In December 1941, a crusade began in Mexico. Over the course of five years, the total evangelical church membership doubled (Page 166).[3] In 1943, the Oriental Missionary Society entered South America, something Lettie never dreamed would happen. The right doors opened, and a Bible Training Institute began that year in Medell\u00edn, Colombia.\n In the fall of 1949, Lettie knew that her time as President of OMS had come to an end. She stepped down from the role with the hope that the mission's book department and crusade department would be released to form another corporation. They were and she accepted the presidency for the new corporation under two names: Cowman Publications, Inc. and World Gospel Crusades.[3]\n In 1957, at 87 years of age, Lettie became very ill. Three years later, she died on Easter Sunday, April 17, 1960.[2]\n", " Kathleen Krull (born July 29, 1952)[1] is an author of children's books.\n Krull was born in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri in 1952 and grew up in Wilmette, Illinois.[1] She graduated from Regina Dominican High School in Wilmette, studied music at Northwestern University, and then earned a B.A. from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, magna cum laude, majoring in English, minoring in music.\n Krull worked as a children\u2019s book editor for several companies in the Midwest.

Egge (born September 20, 1976, in Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada)[1] is an American folk singer-songwriter. She sings, plays guitar, mandolin, bottleneck slide guitar and piano during her live performances.\n Egge grew up the daughter of a teacher and a wheat farmer in Ambrose, North Dakota, and later moved to Silver City, New Mexico. She spent some of her childhood traveling back and forth from North Dakota to a hot springs commune in New Mexico.\n When Egge was 15 years old, she began a one-year apprenticeship with luthier Don Musser, in order to build her own guitar which she still plays exclusively.\n She currently lives in Brooklyn, New York.\n The early songs she wrote were soon noted by bassist Sarah Brown (Albert Collins, Bonnie Raitt) and guitarist Steve James, who persuaded her to record a demo of her original songs in Austin, Texas. The demo led to a record contract with Lazy S.O.B. Recordings and the release of her first full-length album, River Under The Road. The title track was co-written by Egge, Sarah Brown and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. The following year, the Austin Music Awards named Egge, then nineteen, their \"Best Singer/Songwriter\" and \"Best Folk Artist\".\n Next Egge was invited on tour by several luminaries, including Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Iris DeMent, Shawn Colvin and Ron Sexsmith.

It is part of the commune Taiarapu-Est.  With a population of 2338 (in 2007), it is located 49 kilometres southeast of the Tahitian capital of Papeete on the coast of Tautira Bay, at the end of what is the largest valley of the Taiarapu Peninsula. Domingo de Bonechea visited the area in 1772 and attempted to spread Christianity here; James Cook landed at Tautira Bay during his voyage. Robert Louis Stevenson referred to the village as \u201cThe Garden of the World\u201d, staying here to recover from illness in 1886. The village contains a Catholic church.\n Tautira is where Catholic missionaries first landed which eventually led to the takeover of Tahiti by the French people, and which also ended Protestants hold on Tahiti. Earlier, in 1772, Domingo de Bonechea, the Basque captain landed at Aguilla near the Aiurua River, about 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) from Tautira. He had left two missionaries to try convert the indigenous people to Christianity, in 1772. However, when he returned from Peru in 1775 he found that the two missionaries he had left behind on Tahiti failed to convert the natives, and eventually they preferred to return to Peru. However, de Bonechea died on Tahiti during this campaign and he is buried in the Catholic Church in Tautira, which is now named after him. James Cook had landed at Tautira Bay (or \"Cooks Anchorage\") during his voyage.[1] The chiefs of Tautira were reportedly once replaced by the chiefs of Teahupo'o after conflict.[2]\n In 1886, Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and children's books, stayed here for two months to recuperate from his illness. Stevenson had moved to the village from Papeete and lived in a hut called the \"bird-cage house\" where the beautiful Princess Moe, an old lady of royalty, tended him back to good health, bringing him dishes of raw fish in coconut milk, lime juice, sea water and chilli.[3] The local chief, Ori O Ori, befriended him and kept him in his house, and they had even exchanged names as \u201cRui\u201d and \u201cTerii-Tera\u201d. It was during his stay here that Stevenson wrote to his friends calling Tautira as \u201cThe Garden of the World\u201d.[4] In 1915, Tautira was described as being \"the second town of the island\".[5]\n It is located at a distance of 49 kilometres (30\u00a0mi) from Papeete, the capital city of Tahiti. The coastal stretch of the mountainous road extends from Taravoa to Tautira via Pueu. This stretch of the coast also receives the highest rainfall.[1] An 18 kilometres (11\u00a0mi) stretch of highway links Tautira with Taravao.[6] The Tautira River runs nearby,[7] and there is a beach at the mouth of the Vaitepiha River nearby as well.[6]\n Tautira is the largest valley of the Taiarapu Peninsula, resembling Papenoo in that its innermost areas consist of the principal crater-basin. The valley runs outward in a direction a little to the west of north, and is traversed by a large river. The boundaries of the Tautira Valley are high and well marked.[8] Aionifaa Valley lies between Tautira and Aiurua.[8]\n \nTautira Point is a tongue of low wooded land about 600 yards wide, extending northward .75 miles (1.21\u00a0km) from the general line of the coast and from the foot of the mountains.  It is formed by the deposits from the Vaitepiha River, one of the largest streams in Tahiti. The barrier reef fronts the coast from Aiurua Pass to Tautira Point at 3,000 feet (910\u00a0m) and less from the shore.  It encloses channels and basins of deep water. From Vaionifa Pass, barrier reef trends northwestward in a straight line, rounding Tautira Point at only 1,200 feet (370\u00a0m) and breaking off abruptly just westward of the point, where there is a gap with very deep water 2,400 feet (730\u00a0m) wide before the reef begins again. Between Vaionifa and Tautira, there is a smaller gap about 1,200 feet (370\u00a0m) wide in which there is only 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m) of water. Between this pass and Tautira, there is a channel from 1,200\u20131,800 feet (370\u2013550\u00a0m) wide and 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) long which ends in a cul-de-sac at the northern end, with the exception of a small boat passage to the village.  From 19 to 37 fathoms there is mud almost everywhere. At the northern end the soundings decrease gradually to 16 and 8 fathoms. From Tautira Point, the coast trends westward 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) to a short distance beyond Pueu village. The general direction is straight, but two low and wooded points, Pihaa and Faraari, project about 500 yards to seaward; the first at 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) from Tautira, the second about 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) farther on. The mountains behind, from which numerous cascades descend, are steep and cliff-like.[9]\n When Stevenson had visited Tautira in 1888 cruising through the South Seas, he had described the setting of the village as \"...in a cloudy moonlight, on the forest lawn which is the street of Tautira. The Pacific roared outside upon the reef. Here and there one of the scattered palm-built lodges shone out under the shadow of the wood, the lamplight bursting through the crannies of the wall.\u201d The present scene, however, in Tautira is one of \u201cneat bungalows of wood or cinder block with metal roofs\" in the backdrop of the hills of the Vaitepiha River Valley.[10] About one km of trekking along hilly terrain leads to the Vaitepiha River where three maraes (communal or sacred place which serves religious and social purposes in Polynesian societies) were restored in 1960s. However, they are again seen in ruins.[1]\n According to the data recorded at the NOAA Station Id: FP91000987470110, the climatic conditions at Tautira are reported as: Annual average monthly precipitation is 299.11 millimetres (11.776\u00a0in) with a maximum of 474.1 millimetres (18.67\u00a0in) in December and a minimum of 133.7 millimetres (5.26\u00a0in) in August, with average annual incidence of rainfall being 3,590.3 millimetres (141.35\u00a0in). The average high temperature over the year is 28.59\u00a0\u00b0C (83.46\u00a0\u00b0F) and minimum over the year is 22.87\u00a0\u00b0C (73.17\u00a0\u00b0F). The effect of global warming due to climate change has been predicted an increase of 1\u00a0\u00b0C (34\u00a0\u00b0F) and 2\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F).[11]\n The Fe'i, similar to a red banana, is found here and has to be cooked, as the red skin cover in its raw state an inedible pulp.[7]\n Coconut palm with ironwood, milo, mango tree and ulu trees fringe the coastline. Mango tree, ferns and groves of hala trees are seen in the interior valley.[10]\n Partula otaheitana rubescens, an IUCN Red List endangered animalia species, is located in Tautira.[8]\n The demographic evolution of Tautira\u00a0:\n Demographic evolution\n In the 19th century, Tautira boasted a Chinese store and a church. The Catholic Church, Protestants, and Mormon missions were in juxtaposition in the village.[7] When P\u014dmare II returned to kingship in Tahiti, he became a Christian, and destroyed the temple and idol of 'Oro, the national god of Tahiti, at Tautira.[15]\n The Faaa International Airport close to Papeete is the main use of transportation in Tautira. Air Tahiti serves inter-island flights to other islands within French Polynesia. Air France takes passengers to Los Angeles, California. Other destinations are Honolulu, Hawaii; Tokyo, Japan; and Paris, France. The residents of Tautira would drive to Teahupoo and drive northbound toward Faaa. One helipad is nearby and some helicopters drop off passengers.\n Only a few streets of Tautira are paved while the rest are dirt.\n The Papeete Wharf in Papeete has 3 main ships. They are the Aremiti 5, the Aremiti 7, and the Moorea ferry. The Aremiti 5 is the largest of the ships. It has red stripes with a red background. The Aremiti 7 has the same color but is smaller and faster than the Aremiti 5. The Moorea Ferry is white on the top and blue at the bottom. It is the slowest of the 3 ships.

The lectures were originally presented by Joseph Smith to a group of elders in a course known as the \"School of the Prophets\" in the early winter of 1834\u201335 in Kirtland, Ohio.\n Although authorship of the lectures is uncertain, studies suggest that the actual wording was largely by Sidney Rigdon,[1] with substantial involvement and approval by Joseph Smith and possibly others. (See Dahl & Tate at 7\u201310, 16 n. 8.) Smith was involved, both in their authorship in November 1834 and in their later preparation for publication in January 1835. (See History of the Church 2:169\u201370, 180.)\n The original title of each lecture was \"Of Faith\". It was not until 1876, in an edition of the Doctrine and Covenants edited by Church Historian Orson Pratt of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), that the title was given as \"Lectures on Faith\".\n Possibly the most famous quotation is from Lecture 6:7: \"A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation\".\n Faith gives rise to all human endeavors in both worldly and spiritual matters, and is a source of power, both in man and God.\n The human family\u2019s knowledge of God began with God\u2019s interaction with Adam before The Fall, which knowledge was retained after The Fall, and which knowledge has been transmitted via human testimony among Adam's descendants.  Although people since Adam have had to rely on human testimony to learn about God, God can choose to reveal himself directly (as he did to Adam) to those who live a life of devout prayer and service to God.\n In addition to a belief in God, a correct knowledge of God\u2019s character and attributes as revealed in scripture is necessary for the exercise of faith leading to life and salvation.  Effective faith requires the following understanding of God's characteristics:\n From scripture, one can learn that God possesses the following attributes: knowledge, faith (which is His power), justice, judgment, mercy, and truth.  An explanation for why each attribute is necessary in order for mankind to be able to exercise productive faith is provided.\n The Godhead, or the collective persons of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, is expounded upon:\n 1. The Godhead consists of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost (5:1c)\n 2. There are two \"personages\", the Father and the Son, that constitute the \"supreme power over all things\" (5:2a, Q&A section)\n 3. The Father is a \"personage of spirit, glory, and power\" (5:2c)\n 4. The Son is a \"personage of tabernacle\" (5:2d) who \"possess[es] the same mind with the Father; which Mind is the Holy Spirit\" (5:2j,k)\n 5. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit constitute the \"supreme power over all things\" (5:2l)\n 6. \"These three constitute the Godhead and are one: the Father and the Son possessing the same mind, the same wisdom, glory, power, and fullness;\" (5:2m)\n 7. The Son is \"filled with the fullness of the Mind of the Father, or in other words, the Spirit of the Father.\" (5:2o)\n The knowledge that one\u2019s life is in accordance with God's will is necessary for obtaining eternal life.  Any religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, does not have the power to produce the faith necessary for life and salvation.  Those who have not sacrificed all things will not be able to know that their lives are pleasing to God and will therefore not be able to have the faith to overcome the tribulations that stand in the way of becoming joint heirs with Christ in God\u2019s Kingdom.\n By growing in faith, one draws nearer to God, and in the perfection of faith, one becomes like God.\nBy faith, one obtains knowledge of God, through which knowledge one can receive all things pertaining to life and godliness.\n The lectures were published in 1835 as the \"Doctrine\" portion of the volume entitled Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God. The lectures were selected for that volume by a committee appointed on September 24, 1834, by a general assembly of the church to arrange the doctrines and revelations of the church into a single volume. That committee of Presiding Elders, consisting of Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, stated that the lectures were included \"in consequence of their embracing the important doctrine of salvation,\" and that the lectures, together with the church-regulatory sections that followed, represent \"our belief, and when we say this, humbly trust, the faith and principles of this society as a body.\" (See 1835 D&C, Preface.) Accordingly, the church body accepted the committee's compilation on August 17, 1835, as \"the doctrine and covenants of their faith, by a unanimous vote\" (History of the Church 2: 243\u201346).\n Some Latter Day Saint denominations have subsequently removed the lectures from the Doctrine and Covenants. The lectures were removed from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints version of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1897, although that denomination began publishing the lectures in a separate volume in 1952. The LDS Church removed the lectures from the Doctrine and Covenants in the 1921 edition, with an explanation that the lectures \"were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons\". (See Introduction, 1921 edition.) This is in contrast to the remaining pages of the original Doctrine and Covenants, which are officially recognized by nearly all Latter Day Saint denominations as divine revelation given specifically to the church.\n Mormon apologists give several reasons to explain why the Lectures were removed from the scriptural volumes of the LDS Church. According to church apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, the reasons were:\n Brigham Young University's Thomas G. Alexander has stated in a Sunstone article:\n Revision [of the Doctrine and Covenants] continued through July and August 1921, and the Church printed the new edition in late 1921. The committee proposed to delete the 'Lectures on Faith' on the grounds that they were 'lessons prepared for use in the School of the Elders, conducted in Kirtland, Ohio, during the winter of 1834-35; but they were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons.' How the committee came to this conclusion is uncertain. The general conference of the Church in April 1835 had accepted the entire volume, including the Lectures, not simply the portion entitled 'Covenants and Commandments,' as authoritative and binding upon Church members. What seems certain, however, is that the interpretive exegesis of 1916 based upon the reconstructed doctrine of the Godhead had superseded the Lectures.[3]\n Other commentators[who?] have theorized that the lectures represented official church doctrine in 1835, but that by 1897 or 1921, when the work was decanonized by the major Latter Day Saint denominations, the doctrine concerning the Godhead had changed, and the lectures were no longer generally consistent with accepted doctrines. For instance, in Lecture 5, paragraph 2, it defines the Father as a \"personage of spirit, glory and power,\" whereas in section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 22 states that \"the Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's.\"  In addition, the Father and Son are said to possess the same mind, \"which mind is the Holy Spirit\" (Lecture 5, paragraph 2). The Holy Spirit is not a personage, as defined at the beginning of paragraph 2: \"There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing and supreme power over all things .... They are the Father and Son.\" This could cause confusion when compared with section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants: \"The Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.\" Section 130 was added in the 1876 edition and hence co-existed with the Lectures on Faith.\n In 1972, Elder Bruce R. McConkie, then a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' First Council of the Seventy, praised the lectures as follows:\n Today, the Lectures on Faith are part of the Restoration Edition of the Scriptures, an edition of the Latter-day scriptures used by the Fellowships of the remnants.\n", " Viddyad is a cloud-based video creation platform.[1] The company was formed in 2013.[2]\n Viddyad was founded by Grainne Barron in 2013 and launched at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco.[3] Viddyad currently has two offices, one in San Francisco and the other in Dublin, Ireland.[4][5][6]\n Viddyad platform allows users to convert video clips, images, music and animation effects into video.

It runs through the small town of Allyn, Washington, just before releasing into the Case Inlet at the base of the Kitsap Peninsula.\n Sherwood Creek varies widely in its geography, for example, one minute its one inch deep rock bottom, and the next, its three feet deep sand bottom. The creek is fed by Mason Lake, which in turn is fed by another creek. The creek, in places, is rock bottom; the rocks are generally smooth and dark in color. In other places of the creek, it is sand bottom, in these areas it is usually deep. Sherwood Creek has one known tributary.\n The depth of the creek ranges much as in the example, though it can get much deeper than three feet. In some places, the depth has been recorded to be around ten feet, but the creek has hardly been explored. The creek usually has a seasonal flood usually around fall and winter when it rains the most. The creek is also ridden with small to large pools of deep slow moving water. In the sand bottom areas, sometimes the walls of the creek are small cliffs, dropping straight down into the creek. The creek itself lies within its own valley, which is very wide and steep, thus making the creek hard to access. In some places of the valley, it is so steep, it could be considered as a cliff. If you are ever wanting to attempt to access the creek, never go alone, and bring rope. It can be very dangerous in the creek, because when walking in the sand bottom areas, it cause the water to become murky, making it impossible to see the bottom. When the water is murky, there are many dangers present, such as swift currents, sudden drop offs (which the creek is greatly composed of), etc. Later down in the creek, houses line its side, this goes for about a mile or two. But before that, it slows and splits, and then rejoins in what is known as Mill Pond.\n Mill Pond is a large reservoir of water, not much is known about it. It is affected by the tide as it is close to the outlet of the creek. It is believed to have been created in the 1950s by Native Americans within the area for fishing. But it is now inaccessible to the public. It is scarcely viewable, though the best view is at a residence along Washington State Route 3. There, you can see the small lake (referred to as a pond) and how the creek used to be. You can see a dark area running through the center of it, which is where the creek used to be. A way to tell if your near it, is when on Route 3, you will see a small lake to your left if heading towards Shelton, Washington. This lake is known as Catfish Lake.\n The small town of Allyn was settled in 1853, but it would not be until 1889 when it was official. By 1890, Allyn had become a large lumber exporter, with railways going along the creek. This meant that Allyn had to have its own sawmill, which it did. The sawmill was set at the creek. The operator of the mill was Joe Sherwood, who died from an accident at the mill in 1873. After Joe's death, they named Sherwood Creek after him. Later, in the 1950s, it is believed that Mill Pond was formed. The local Indian tribe created it, most likely for fishing. Currently, a group known as the ASEG (Allyn Salmon Enhancement Group) is working on protecting and helping the salmon in the creek. They do numerous projects at the creek, from the delta to the start. Also currently, there is a Naval railway running alongside the unpopulated side of the creek's valley. The railway, at a point, crosses over the creek near its start. You can also find ruins from an old logging site, and possible parts of the old State Route 3. These are located on a small hidden road near a residence.\n Part of the creek is considered an estuary, as the whole creek is full of life. During October through November, salmon swim up the creek in order to reproduce.Crayfish are a rare sight, but do live in the creek. On land, Deer, Coyotes, Bears, Chipmunks, Squirrels, Rabbits, and possibly Bigfoot plus numerous types of birds, flora, fungi, rodents and insects are all present. At night, spiders come out to hunt, it seemingly rains spiders from the trees. Also at night, other creatures come out to hunt, such as the Coyotes, which are a hazard to other animals and people. They come up to peoples' houses to try to get their animals, which can be a nuisance. There is also many beavers within the creek, their neatly chewed sticks can be found all around.\n", " Mikhail Nikolaevich Lysenko is a retired Russian diplomat.\n In 1977 he entered the foreign service.

He became a gentleman commoner of Trinity College, Oxford in 1626, graduated BA in 1629 and entered the Middle Temple the same year.\n On the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the parliamentary army, fighting at the Battle of Edgehill in October 1642, and at the Battle of Gainsborough in July 1643. He was made deputy-governor of the Isle of Ely by Cromwell and served under Earl of Manchester in the Yorkshire campaign and at the second Battle of Newbury, afterwards supporting Cromwell in his accusations of incompetency against the Earl.\n On the night before the Battle of Naseby, in June 1645, Ireton succeeded in surprising the Royalist army and captured many prisoners. The next day, on the suggestion of Cromwell, he was made commissary-general and appointed to the command of the left wing, Cromwell himself commanding the right. The wing under Ireton was completely broken by the impetuous charge of Rupert and Ireton was wounded and taken prisoner, but Cromwell charged and successfully routed the Royalists, freeing prisoners including Ireton.\n Ireton was at the siege of Bristol in September 1645 and took part in the subsequent campaign that succeeded in overthrowing the royal cause. On 30 October 1645 Ireton entered parliament as member for Appleby. On 15 June 1646,[citation needed][1] during the siege of Oxford he married Bridget Cromwell, eldest daughter of Oliver Cromwell. The marriage brought Ireton's career into parallel with Cromwell's.\n Ireton was initially a moderate. At the Putney Debates he opposed extremism, disliked the views of the Republicans and the Levellers, which he considered impractical and dangerous to the foundations of society, and wished to retain the constitution of King, Lords and Commons. He argued for these in the negotiations of the army with Parliament, and in the conferences with the king, being the person chiefly entrusted with the drawing up of the army proposals, including the manifesto called \"The Heads of the Proposals\" which proposed a constitutional monarchy. He tried to prevent the breach between the army and parliament, but when it happened, he supported the negotiations with the king till his actions made him unpopular.\n Ireton finally became convinced of the hopelessness of dealing with King Charles, and, after the king's flight to the Isle of Wight, treated his further proposals with coldness and urged the parliament to establish an administration without him.  Ireton served under Thomas Fairfax in the second civil war in the campaigns, in Kent and Essex, although it was Fairfax, as Lord General, and not Ireton as is sometimes believed, who was responsible for the executions of Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle at Colchester.  After the rejection by the king of the last offers of the army, Ireton zealously supported bringing him to trial. He wrote the Army's statement about the regicide\u2014the Remonstrance of the Army\u2014with Hugh Peters. He was active in the choice to purge rather than reelect Parliament and supported the second Leveller Agreement of the People. He sat on the king's trial and was one of the commissioners who signed the death warrant.\n Ireton's regiment was chosen by lot to accompany Cromwell in his Irish campaign. Ireton arrived in Dublin two days after Cromwell on 17 August 1649, with 77 ships full of troops and supplies. Ireton was appointed major-general and after the conquest of the south of Ireland, Lord President of Munster. He went over with John Cook with a brief to reform the law of Ireland, to anglicise it, and to make it a model for a new settlement of English law.\n In May 1650 Cromwell was recalled to England to command a Parliamentary force preparing to invade Scotland, and Ireton assumed command of the New Model Army in Ireland with the title and powers of Lord Deputy to complete the conquest of the country. This he proceeded to do, becoming noted as much by the savagery of his methods as for his military skill. By the middle of 1650 Ireton and his commanders faced two problems. One was the capture of the remaining cities held by the Irish Confederate and Royalists forces. The other was an escalating guerrilla war in the countryside as Irish fighters called tories attacked his supply lines. Ireton appealed to the English Parliament to publish lenient surrender terms for Irish Catholics, in order to end their resistance, but this was refused.\n His first action after the refusal was to mount a counter-guerrilla expedition into the Wicklow Mountains early in June 1650, in order to secure his lines of supply for the Siege of Waterford in Ireland's southeast. Ireton then blockaded Waterford into surrender by August 1650. Ireton systematically constructed trenches to bring his siege guns within range of the walls and stationed a Parliamentary fleet off the city to prevent its re-supply. Thomas Preston surrendered Waterford after a three-month siege. Ireton then advanced to Limerick by October, but had to call off the siege due to cold and bad weather. Early in 1651 Ireton ordered that areas harbouring the guerrillas should be systematically stripped of food \u2013 a scorched earth policy that caused a famine in Ireland by the end of the year. Ireton returned to Limerick in June 1651 and besieged the city for five months until it surrendered in October 1651. At the same time, Galway was under siege by Parliamentarian forces, and Ireton rode to inspect the command of Charles Coote, who was blockading that city. The physical strain of his command took hold on Ireton, however, and he fell ill.\n After the capture of Limerick, Ireton had dignitaries of Limerick hanged for their defence of the city, including an Alderman, Bishop (Turlough O'Brien) Terence Albert O'Brien and an English Royalist officer, Colonel Fennell. He also wanted the Irish commander, Hugh Dubh O'Neill hanged, but Edmund Ludlow cancelled the order after Ireton's death.\n Ireton fell ill of the plague that was raging through the town, and died on 26 November. His loss reportedly \"struck a great sadness into Cromwell\" and he was considered a great loss to the administration. There are various anecdotes about his demise from Irish ecclesiastical and English royalist sources. Thus, his death has been depicted as divine punishment for the execution of Bishop O'Brien, who prior to his death had called upon Ireton to answer at God's judgment seat for his murders; the Hibernica Dominicana claims that on his death bed Ireton was  \"privately muttering to himself 'I never gave the aid of my counsel towards the murder of that bishop; never, never; it was the council of war did it\u2026 I wish I had never seen this popish bishop'.\" [2] Philip Warwick stated that among Ireton's last words were \"blood! blood! I must have more blood!\".[3]\n At Ireton's funeral, in Westminster Abbey,[4] John Watson and others wore new tabards that replaced the royal arms with the new arms of the commonwealth.[5]\n By his wife, Bridget Cromwell, Ireton left one son, Henry Ireton (c.1652\u20131711),[6] and four daughters, one of whom, Bridget Bendish (she married Thomas Bendish in 1670) is said to have compromised herself in the Rye House Plot of 1683, as did Henry.[7] Ireton's widow Bridget afterwards married General Charles Fleetwood. Another daughter Elizabeth married Thomas Polhill, their son was David Polhill.\n On 30 January 1661, following the Restoration of the English monarchy of 1660, Charles II had Ireton's corpse exhumed from Westminster and mutilated in a posthumous execution, along with those of Cromwell and John Bradshaw, in retribution for signing his father's death warrant. The date was symbolic, being the 12th anniversary of the execution of Charles I.\n A blue plaque was affixed to Ireton's birthplace at Church Lane in Attenborough, on 22 June 2011 by the Beeston and District Local History Society with the following text: \n\"General Henry Ireton lawyer, confederate and son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell born here 1611 died Limerick 1651\" [8]  \nThe town of Ireton, Iowa, United States was named after Henry Ireton. \n Ireton Avenue in Beeston near to Attenborough is named after General Ireton.  Ireton Road in Market Harborough was also named after Henry Ireton, whilst Ireton Way is now a very straight part of the A142 between Ely and Chatteris, built by Ireton when he was commanding East Anglian forces as a causeway across the flooded Fens around the Ouse river to rush troops and supplies over when resisting Royalist attack from Lincolnshire and the Midlands.\n There is also an Ireton Road in Colchester. This adjoins Honywood Road, named after Sir Thomas Honywood who led the Essex forces at the Siege of Colchester under the command of Thomas Fairfax.\n His portrait continues to hang in the dining hall of Trinity College, Oxford.\n In the 1970 film Cromwell starring Richard Harris and Alec Guinness, Michael Jayston plays Ireton as a subtle but well-meaning manipulator who hates Charles I and pushes Cromwell into actions which Cromwell at first considers neither desirable nor possible but then pursues all the way. This version of Ireton is ready to denounce the King and plunge England into civil war before Cromwell becomes convinced that this is a necessary step. In the film, he and Cromwell are also among the five members whom Charles I attempts to arrest on the eve of the war (when in fact they were not) and, after the King is executed, is upbraided by Cromwell as being too ambitious. There is no mention in the film of Ireton marrying Cromwell's daughter.\n Ireton is portrayed as a minor character in Rosemary Sutcliff's 1953 historical fiction novel Simon.\n Ireton is the main character in John Attenborough's 1987 historical fiction novel Destiny Our Choice, which gives a generally positive view of Ireton, claiming that he was influential in saving the life of Hugh O'Neill after the Siege of Limerick in 1650-51.\n", " The discography of Joey DeFrancesco consists of twenty-nine studio albums on Columbia Records, Muse Records, Big Mo Records, Concord Records, HighNote Records, Concord Jazz, and Doodlin' Records.\n", " \n Allan Grogan is a Scottish political activist in Angus, an ex-professional wrestler,[1] and the founder of the Labour for Independence (LFI) campaign.[2] Since October 2014, he has been a member of the Scottish Socialist Party.[3][4]\n Grogan was a Labour sympathizer, joining the Labour Party in his late teens. He remained a member into his early-twenties until he left the UK to work in Asia. He returned to Scotland and rejoined the party in 2010, working for it in election campaigns.[2]\n In 2012, he launched LFI as a \"home\" for pro-indy Labour voters,[5] and spoke out against Labour's decision to join the Conservatives in the Better Together campaign.[6]\n In 2014, Grogan was invited to make the case for Scottish independence at a Scottish Labour spring conference fringe event hosted by the Law Society of Scotland. He shared a platform with Shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran and former First Minister Henry McLeish.[7]\n McLeish urged conference attendees to be \"tolerant of dissident voices\" after Grogan's advocacy of a \"Yes\" vote prompted jeering from the audience.[8] Writing after the debate, Grogan said that \"independence need not mean UK lite, but a progressive nation that cares for all its citizens\", and that Labour \"can play the leading role in this, but it must accept their follies and embrace the need for real and lasting change\".[9]\n After the referendum results were announced, Grogan left the Labour Party and stood down as LFI's co-convenor.[10] In October 2014, Grogan joined the Scottish Socialist Party ahead of its annual conference.[3] Writing in the Scottish Socialist Voice, he admitted that the SSP \"reflect the real socialist values that I have campaigned on during the referendum and throughout my life as a Labour Party member\".[11]\n At the SSP's annual conference in May 2015, Grogan was elected to the party's ruling Executive Committee.[12]\n", " A deacon is a member of the diaconate, an office in Christian churches that is generally associated with service of some kind, but which varies among theological and denominational traditions.  Some Christian churches, such as the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican church, view the diaconate as part of the clerical state; in others, the deacon remains a layperson.\n The title is also used for the president, chairperson, or head of a trades guild in Scotland; and likewise to two officers of a Masonic lodge.\n The word deacon is derived from the Greek word di\u00e1konos (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2),[1] which is a standard ancient Greek word meaning \"servant\", \"waiting-man\", \"minister\", or \"messenger\".[2]  One commonly promulgated speculation as to its etymology is that it literally means \"through the dust\", referring to the dust raised by the busy servant or messenger.[3]\n It is generally assumed that the office of deacon originated in the selection of seven men by the apostles, among them Stephen, to assist with the charitable work of the early church as recorded in Acts 6.[4][5]\n The title deaconess (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 diak\u00f3nissa) is not found in the Bible. However, one woman, Phoebe, is mentioned at Romans 16:1\u20132 as a deacon (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 di\u00e1konos) of the church in Cenchreae. Nothing more specific is said about her duties or authority, although it is assumed she carried Paul's Letter to the Romans. The exact relationship between male and female deacons varies. In some traditions a female deacon is simply a member of the order of deacons, while in others, deaconesses constitute a separate order. In some traditions, the title \"deaconess\" was also sometimes given to the wife of a deacon.\n Female deacons are mentioned by Pliny the Younger in a letter to the emperor Trajan dated c. 112.  \u201cI believed it was necessary to find out from two female slaves (ex duabus ancillis) who were called deacons (ministrae), what was true\u2014and to find out through torture (per tormenta)\u201d[6] This is the earliest Latin text that appears to refer to female deacons as a distinct category of Christian minister.[6]\n A biblical description of the qualities required of a deacon, and of his household, can be found in 1 Timothy 3:1\u201313.\n Among the more prominent deacons in history are Stephen, the first Christian martyr (the \"protomartyr\"); Philip, whose baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch is recounted in Acts 8:26\u201340; St. Phoebe, who is mentioned in the letter to the Romans; Saint Lawrence, an early Roman martyr; Saint Vincent of Saragossa, protomartyr of Spain; Saint Francis of Assisi, founder of the mendicant Franciscans; Saint Ephrem the Syrian; and Saint Romanos the Melodist, a prominent early hymnographer. Prominent historical figures who played major roles as deacons and went on to higher office include Athanasius of Alexandria, Thomas Becket, and Reginald Pole. On June 8, 536, a serving Roman deacon was raised to Pope, Silverius.\n The diaconate has been retained as a separate vocation in Eastern Christianity, while in Western Christianity it was largely used in cathedrals and as a temporary step along the path toward priestly ordination. In the 20th century, the diaconate was restored as a vocational order in many Western churches, most notably in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and the United Methodist Church.\n In the Catholic, Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches, the diaconate is one of the major orders in the, the other major orders being bishop, presbyter (priest) and, historically, subdeacon. Deacons assist priests in their pastoral and administrative duties, but often report directly to the bishops of their diocese. They have a distinctive role in the liturgy of the Eastern and Western Churches.\n Beginning around the fifth century, there was a gradual decline in the diaconate as a permanent state of life in the Latin Church.[7] From that time onward, the only men ordained as deacons were seminarians who were completing the last year or so of graduate theological training, so-called \"transitional deacons\", who received the order after they complete their third year at the theological seminary, several months before priestly ordination.\n Following the recommendations of the Second Vatican Council (in Lumen gentium, 29), in 1967 Pope Paul VI issued the motu proprio Sacrum Diaconatus Ordinem, reviving the practice of ordaining to the diaconate men who were not candidates for priestly ordination. These men are known as permanent deacons in contrast to those continuing their formation, who were then called transitional deacons. There is no sacramental or canonical difference between the two, however, as there is only one order of deacons.[8]\n The period of formation to the permanent diaconate varies from diocese to diocese as determined by the local ordinary, but it usually entails a period of prayerful preparation and several years of study. Diaconal candidates receive instruction in philosophy, theology, study of the Bible, homiletics, sacramental studies, evangelization, ecclesiology, counseling, and pastoral care and ministry before ordination.\n They may be assigned to work in a parish by the diocesan bishop, where they are under the supervision of the parish pastors, or in diocesan ministries.[9] Unlike most clerics, permanent deacons who also have a secular profession have no right to receive a salary for their ministry,[10] but many dioceses opt to remunerate them anyway.[11]\n During the Mass, the deacon's responsibilities including assisting the priest, proclaiming the Gospel, announcing the General Intercessions, and distributing Communion. They may also preach the homily.[12] As clerics, deacons are required to pray the Liturgy of the Hours.  Deacons, like priests and bishops, are ordinary ministers of the sacrament of Baptism and may witness at the sacrament of Holy Matrimony outside of Mass. Deacons may lead funeral rites outside of Mass such as the final commendation at the gravesite or the reception of the body at a service in the funeral home, and may assist the priest at the Requiem Mass. They can also preside over various services such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and they may give certain blessings. They cannot hear confession and give absolution, anoint the sick, or celebrate Mass.\n The vestments most particularly associated with the Western Rite Catholic deacon are the alb, stole and dalmatic. Deacons, like priests and bishops, must wear their albs and stoles; deacons place the stole over their left shoulder and it hangs across to their right side, while priests and bishops wear it around their necks. The dalmatic, a vestment especially associated with the deacon, is worn during the celebration of the Mass and other liturgical functions; its use is more liberally applied than the corresponding vestment of the priest, the chasuble. At certain major celebrations, such as ordinations, the diocesan bishop wears a dalmatic under his chasuble, to signify that he enjoys the fullness of the three degrees of Holy Orders\u00a0\u2013 deacon, priest, and bishop.\n The transitional diaconate is conferred on seminarians (continuing to the priesthood) no sooner than 23 years of age (canon 1031 of the Code of Canon Law). The permanent diaconate can be conferred on single men 25 or older, and on married men 35 or older, but an older age can be required by the episcopal conference.[13] If a married deacon is widowed, he must maintain the celibate state. Under some very rare circumstances, however, deacons who have been widowed can receive permission to remarry. This is most commonly done when the deacon is left as a single father. In some cases, a widowed deacon will seek priestly ordination, especially if his children are grown.[14]\n A deacon is not styled \"Father\" as a priest would be, but as \"Deacon\",[15] (in Spanish, \"Di\u00e1cono\")[16] abbreviated variously as \"Dn.\" or \"Dcn.\" This preferred method of address is stated in the 2005 document of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Directory for the Formation, Ministry and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States. The proper address in written correspondence for all Deacons of the Latin (Roman Rite) Catholic Church in the United States is \"Deacon Name\",[17] although it is not uncommon to see \"Rev. Mr.\" sometimes used. \"Rev. Mr.\", however, is more often used to indicate a transitional deacon (i.e., preparing for ordination to the priesthood) or one who belongs to a religious institute, while Rev. Deacon is used as the honorific for permanent deacons in many dioceses (e.g. Rev. Deacon John Smith, or Deacon John Smith). The decision as to whether deacons wear the Roman collar as street attire is left to the discretion of each bishop for his own diocese. Where clerical garb is approved by the bishop, the deacon can choose to wear or not wear the \"collar\".[citation needed] Where it is not permitted, the deacon must wear secular clothing.\n Deacons, like seminarians, religious, and the two other orders, bishops and priests, pray the Liturgy of the Hours; however, deacons are usually only required to pray Morning and Evening Prayer.\n In addition to proclaiming the Gospel and assisting in the distribution of Holy Communion, the deacon censes the icons and people, calls the people to prayer, leads the litanies, and has a role in the dialogue of the Anaphora. In keeping with Eastern tradition, he is not permitted to perform any Sacred Mysteries (sacraments) on his own, except for Baptism in extremis (in danger of death), conditions under which anyone, including the laity, may baptize. When assisting at a normal baptism, it is often the deacon who goes down into the water with the one being baptized (Acts 8:38). In contrast to the Roman Catholic Church, deacons in the Eastern Churches may not preside at the celebration of marriages, as in Eastern theology the sacrament is conferred by the nuptial blessing of a priest.\n Diaconal vestments are the sticharion (dalmatic), the orarion (deacon's stole), and the epimanikia (cuffs). The last are worn under his sticharion, not over it as does a priest or bishop.  The deacon usually wears a simple orarion which is only draped over the left shoulder but, if elevated to the rank of archdeacon, he wears the \"doubled-orarion\", meaning it is passed over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and then crossed over the left shoulder (see photograph, right).  In modern Greek practice, a deacon wears this doubled orarion from the time of his ordination.  Also, in the Greek practice, he wears the clerical kamilavka (cylindrical head covering) with a rim at the top. In Slavic practice, a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) wears the simple black kamilavka of a monk (without the rim), but he removes the monastic veil (see klobuk) when he is vested; a married deacon would not wear a kamilavka unless it is given to him by the bishop as an ecclesiastical award; the honorary kamilavka is purple in colour, and may be awarded to either married or monastic clergy.\n As far as street clothing is concerned, immediately following his ordination the deacon receives a blessing to wear the Exorasson (Arabic: Jib'be, Slavonic: Riassa), an outer cassock with wide sleeves, in addition to the Anterion (Slavonic: Podraznik), the inner cassock worn by all orders of clergy. In the Slavic practice, married clergy may wear any of a number of colours, but most often grey, while monastic clergy always wear black. In certain jurisdictions in North America and Western Europe, a Roman collar is often worn, although this is not a traditional or widespread practice.\n A protodeacon (Greek: \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2: protodiakonos, \"first deacon\") is a distinction of honor awarded to senior deacons, usually serving on the staff of the diocesan bishop. An archdeacon is similar, but is among the monastic clergy. Protodeacons and archdeacons use a double-length orarion even if it is not the local tradition for all deacons to use it. In the Slavic tradition a deacon may be awarded the doubled-orarion even if he is not a protodeacon or archdeacon.\n According to the practice of the Greek Orthodox Church of America, in keeping with the tradition of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the most common way to address a deacon is \"Father\".[18] Depending on local tradition, deacons are addressed as either \"Father\", \"Father Deacon\", \"Deacon Father\", or, if addressed by a bishop, simply as \"Deacon\".\n The tradition of kissing the hands of ordained clergy extends to the diaconate as well.  This practice is rooted in the Holy Eucharist and is in acknowledgement and respect of the eucharistic role members of the clergy play in preparing, handling and disbursing the sacrament during the Divine Liturgy, and in building and serving the church as the Body of Christ.\n Anciently, the Eastern churches ordained women as deaconesses. This practice fell into desuetude in the second millennium, but has been revived in some Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches. Saint Nectarios of Aegina ordained a number of nuns as deaconesses in convents. Deaconesses would assist in anointing and baptising women, and in ministering to the spiritual needs of the women of the community.  As churches discontinued ordaining women as deacons, these duties largely fell to the nuns and to the priests' wives.\n In Anglican churches, deacons are permitted to marry freely before or after ordination, as are Anglican priests. Most deacons are \"transitional\", that is, preparing for the priesthood and they are usually ordained priests about a year after their diaconal ordination. However, there are some deacons who do not go on to receive priestly ordination, so-called \"permanent deacons\". Many provinces of the Anglican Communion ordain both women and men as deacons. Many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate. The effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time, as most men proceeded to be ordained priests after a short time as a deacon.\n Anglican deacons may baptize and in some dioceses are granted licences to solemnize matrimony, usually under the instruction of their parish priest and bishop. Deacons are not able to preside at the Eucharist (but can lead worship with the distribution of already-consecrated communion elements where this is permitted), nor can they pronounce God's absolution of sin or pronounce the Trinitarian blessing.[19] In most cases, deacons minister alongside other clergy.\n An Anglican deacon wears an identical choir dress to an Anglican priest: cassock, surplice, tippet and academic hood. However, liturgically, deacons usually wear a stole over their left shoulder and fastened on the right side of their waist. This is worn both over the surplice and the alb. A deacon might also wear a dalmatic.\n \n There are two distinct offices of deacon in the Church of Scotland. The best-known form of diaconate are trained and paid pastoral workers. The permanent diaconate was formerly exclusively female, and it was in 1988, the centenary year of the diaconate, that men were admitted to the office of deacon. The offices of deacon and minister are now both open to both women and men; deacons are now ordained (they were previously \"commissioned\").\n The other office of deacon can be found in congregations formerly belonging to the pre-1900 Free Church of Scotland, with a \"Deacons' Court\" having responsibility for financial and administrative oversight of congregations. Only a few congregations still retain this constitutional model, with most having since adopted the Church of Scotland's \"Model Constitution\" (with a Kirk Session and Congregational Board) or \"Unitary Congregation\" (with just a Kirk Session). Most of the Free Church congregations united with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1900 creating the United Free Church of Scotland, which itself united with the Church of Scotland in 1929.\n The congregations of the post-1900 Free Church of Scotland which did not join the UF Church in 1900 continue to have Deacons.\n One of John Calvin's legacies was to restore the diaconate as a servant ministry.[20] Individual congregations of the various Presbyterian denominations, such as the Presbyterian Church (USA), Presbyterian Church in America and Orthodox Presbyterian Church, also elect deacons, along with elders. However, in some churches the property-functions of the diaconate and session of elders is commended to an independent board of trustees.[21]\n In many Dutch Reformed churches deacons are charged with ministries of mercy. As such, the deacons are also members of the local church council. A special feature of the Dutch Reformed churches is the fact that the diaconate of each local church is its own legal entity with its own financial means, separated from the church itself, and governed by the deacons.\n In Methodism, deacons began as a transitional order before ordination as elders (presbyters). In 1996, the United Methodist Church ended the transitional deacon and established a new Order of Deacons to be equal in status with the Order of Elders. Both men and women may be ordained as deacons. Deacons serve in a variety of specialized ministries including, but not limited to, Christian education, music, communications and ministries of justice and advocacy. Unlike United Methodist elders, deacons must find their own place of service. Nevertheless, the bishop does officially approve and appoint deacons to their selected ministry.[22] Deacons may assist the elder in the administration of Sacraments, but must receive special approval from a bishop before presiding over Baptism and Holy Communion.[23] United Methodist deacons are present in North America, Europe and Africa.\n The Methodist Church of Great Britain also has a permanent diaconate\u2014based on an understanding of the New Testament that deacons have an equal, but distinct ministry from presbyters. Deacons are called to a ministry of service and witness, and \"to hold before them the needs and concerns of the world\".[24] The original Wesleyan Deaconess Order was founded by Thomas Bowman Stephenson in 1890, following observation of new ministries in urban areas in the previous years.[25] The order continued as the Wesley Deaconess Order following Methodist Union in 1932, but, following the admission of women to \"The Ministry\" (as presbyteral ministry is commonly termed in the Methodist Church), a number of deaconesses transferred and recruitment for the WDO ceased from 1978. The 1986 Methodist Conference re-opened the order to both men and women and the first ordinations to the renewed order occurred during the 1990 Conference in Cardiff, which coincided with celebrations of 100 years of diaconal service in British Methodism; deaconesses had previously been ordained at their annual convocation.[25]\n The Methodist Church of Southern Africa ordains deacons who constitute a diaconal order, similar to that in the British church.[26]\n Deacons are also appointed or elected in other Protestant denominations, though this is less commonly seen as a step towards the clerical ministry.  The role of deacon in these denominations varies greatly from denomination to denomination; often, there will be more emphasis on administrative duties than on pastoral or liturgical duties. In some denominations, deacons' duties are only financial management and practical aid and relief. Elders handle pastoral and other administrative duties.\n Iglesia ni Cristo's deacons serve as worship service's strict etiquette checkers in male's seatings, deaconesses are their female counterparts. They also serve as offering collectors and other Church duties during worship services. Deacons are required to be married people of strong faith and good example. There is also a head deacon, who leads the congregation in prayer before the sermon and the prayer for voluntary offerings. They  were also can be promoted to Bishops, if they are faithful to the rules.\n The Amish have deacons, but they are elected by a council and receive no formal training.\n The Church of the Brethren also have deacons, as do other Brethren denominations.  They are elected by the congregation to serve in ministries of compassion.  They are elected for life in some congregations.\n Baptists traditionally recognize two ordained positions in the church: Elders (Pastors) and Deacons, as per 1 Timothy 3.  Some Baptist churches in the Reformed tradition recognize elder and pastor as separate offices.\n Baptists have traditionally followed the principle of the autonomy of the local church congregation, giving each church the ability to discern for themselves the interpretation of scripture.  Thus, the views among Baptist churches as to who becomes a deacon and when, as well as what they do and how they go about doing it, vary greatly: some Baptist churches have the deacons decide many of the church affairs, while others have deacons in serving roles only.  \n The predominant view among Baptist churches (especially theologically conservative ones, including the majority of Southern Baptist and Independent Baptist churches) is that a deacon must be a male, and married (or a widower) and not divorced previously.  If a deacon subsequently divorces, he must relinquish his office (but if his wife dies he may continue to serve).  However, there are Baptist churches where women are allowed to be deacons or deaconesses (primarily in the United Kingdom and in the United States among African-American and theologically moderate churches).  In the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, deacons can be any adult male member of the congregation who is in good standing.\n In some African American Missionary Baptist churches and in churches affiliated with the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. male and female deacons serve as one board. Other churches may have two separate boards of deacons and deaconesses. Most often the deacon or deacon candidate is a long-standing member of the church, being middle aged, but younger deacons may be selected from among members of a family that has had several generations in the same church.  They are elected by quorum vote annually. Their roles are semi-pastoral in that they fill in for the pastor on occasion, or support the pastor vocally during his sermon. They may also lead a special prayer service, generally known as \"The Deacon's Prayer.\" Their other roles are to accompany the pastor during Communion by handing out the remembrances of bread and wine (or grape juice) and to set a good example for others to follow.  Their administrative duties sometimes include oversight of the treasury, Sunday school curriculum, transportation, and various outreach ministries.\n See Baptist Distinctives for a more detailed treatment of Deacons in churches in other Associations, particularly the UK.\n In the Uniting Church in Australia, the diaconate is one of two offices of ordained ministry. The other is Minister of the Word.\n Deacons in the Uniting Church are called to minister to those on the fringes of the church and be involved in ministry in the community. Deacons offer leadership in a ministry of service to the world. The primary focus of the ministry of Deacon is on care and compassion for the poor and oppressed and in seeking social justice for all people. They take both an active role in leadership in such actions themselves, but are also play a key role in encouraging other Uniting Church members in similar action.\n Some examples of service that Deacons may take include: prison chaplaincy, acting as youth or community workers, in community service agencies, in schools and hospitals, or in mission placements in Australia or overseas. Although the primary responsibility for worship in congregations lies with the Ministers of the Word, Deacons have a liturgical role appropriate to their distinctive ministry, including ministries where their main leadership is within a congregation.\n In the Uniting Church both ministers of the word and deacons are styled The Reverend.\n The Uniting Church has recognised deacons since union, but it was not until the 6th Assembly in 1991 that the Uniting Church began ordaining deacons. This was partly because the historical, theological and sociological roles of deaconesses and deacons was being widely discussed in Churches throughout the world at the time that the Basis of Union was being drafted [27]\n The office of Deacon is generally open to all 12- and 13-year-old male members of the church; all are encouraged to become Deacons. Duties include:\n In accordance with Church of Christ doctrine and practice, only males may serve as deacons (deaconesses are not recognized), and must meet Biblical qualifications (generally I Timothy 3:8-13 is the Biblical text used to determine if a male is qualified to serve as deacon).  A deacon may also be qualified to serve as an elder (and, in fact, may move into that role after a period of time if his service as deacon is considered acceptable).\n The role of the deacon varies, depending on the local congregation.  Generally a deacon will have responsibility for a specific non-spiritual function (e.g. finance, building and grounds, benevolence); however, the deacons (like the rest of the congregation) are under the subjection of the elders, who have spiritual and administrative authority over the deacon's function.\n In congregations which lack qualified elders (where, in their absence, the men of the congregation handle leadership duties), a deacon would have ruling authority, but not due to his position as a deacon.\n In the New Apostolic Church, the deacon ministry is a local ministry.  A deacon mostly works in his home congregation to support the priests.  If a priest is unavailable, a deacon will hold a divine service, without the act of communion (Only Priests and up can consecrate Holy Communion).\n Deacons among Jehovah's Witnesses are referred to as ministerial servants, claiming it preferable to translate the descriptive Greek term used in the Bible rather than merely transliterate it as though it were a title.[28] Appointed ministerial servants aid elders in congregational duties. Like the elders, they are adult baptized males[29] and serve voluntarily.[30]\n The title \"woman deacon\" or \"deaconess\" appears in many documents from the early Church period, particularly in the East. Their duties were often different from that of male deacons; women deacons prepared adult women for baptism and they had a general apostolate to female Christians and catechumens (typically for the sake of modesty).[31] Women appear to have been ordained as deacons to serve the larger community until about the 6th century in the West.[32] Liturgies for the ordination of women deacons had similarities with as well as differences from with those for male deacons.[33] Opinions on the sacramental nature of the ordination vary: some scholars argue that the ordination of women deacons would have been equally sacramental to that of male deacons,[34] while others say that women deacons of history were not sacramentally ordained in the full sense, as determined in the Catholic Church by Canons 1008 and 1009 of the Code of Canon Law.[35]\n The Catholic Church presently does not recognise the validity of female ordinations, be it to the diaconate or any other clerical order. In August 2016, the Catholic Church established a Study Commission on the Women's Diaconate to study the history of female deacons and to study the possibility of ordaining women as deacons.[36] The Russian Orthodox Church had a female diaconate into the 20th century. The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece restored a monastic female diaconate in 2004.[37]\n The Greek word diakonos (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) gave rise to the following terms from the history of Russia, not to be confused with each other: \"dyak\", \"podyachy\", \"dyachok\", in addition to \"deacon\" and \"protodeacon\".\n In Scots, the title deacon is used for a head-workman, a master or chairman of a trade guild, or one who is adept, expert and proficient. The term deaconry refers to the office of a deacon or the trade guild under a deacon\".\n The most famous holder of this title was Deacon Brodie who was a cabinet-maker and president of the Incorporation of Wrights and Masons as well as being a Burgh councillor of Edinburgh, but at night led a double life as a burglar. He is thought to have inspired the story of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.\n", " Dusen may refer to:\n", " Boaz Toporovsky (Hebrew: .mw-parser-output .script-hebrew,.mw-parser-output .script-Hebr{font-size:1.15em;font-family:\"Ezra SIL\",\"Ezra SIL SR\",\"Keter Aram Tsova\",\"Taamey Ashkenaz\",\"Taamey David CLM\",\"Taamey Frank CLM\",\"Frank Ruehl CLM\",\"Keter YG\",\"Shofar\",\"David CLM\",\"Hadasim CLM\",\"Simple CLM\",\"Nachlieli\",\"SBL BibLit\",\"SBL Hebrew\",Cardo,Alef,\"Noto Serif Hebrew\",\"Noto Sans Hebrew\",\"David Libre\",David,\"Times New Roman\",Gisha,Arial,FreeSerif,FreeSans}\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b7\u05d6 \u05d8\u05d5\u05bc\u05e4\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u05b0\u05e1\u05b0\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u200e, born 17 July 1980) is an Israeli politician.

Her father was Richard Quigly, a civil engineer. In her early childhood she travelled abroad with her family. She then attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London and then entered the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art around 1906. There she studied under the school's first stained glass master, Alfred E. Child, discovering a talent for illuminating glass. She went on to occasionally work with An T\u00far Gloine under Sarah Purser.[1] She showed a copper cup and stand at the 1910 exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland while she was still a student. In 1911 she contributed pages to the illuminated album with panels and borders of Celtic ornament, Address of welcome to Queen Mary from the women of Ireland.[3] She exhibited with the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) in 1917 with two works, and was living at 5 Clareville Road, Dublin. The same year she showed a wood-block print, Girl with two lamps, with the Arts and Crafts Society.[1] By 1917, Quigly was a member of the Guild of Irish Artworkers, representing the Guild on the council of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in 1917.[3]\n Quigly began working for Harry Clarke in January 1919, at his studios in North Frederick Street, becoming a full employee in October 1921. Said by some to have been his most valuable assistant, she worked with Clarke until 1924, working on St Stephen's window in a church in Gorey, County Wexford and the Angel of peace and hope window in Holy Trinity church, Killiney, County Dublin. She created three windows for the dolls house, Titania's Palace. Her most notable work she created with Clarke is the Eve of St Agnes, when it was shown at the Aonach Tailteann art exhibition in August 1924 it won a trophy gold medal. The window is now display at the Hugh Lane Gallery.[1]\n At the 1925 Arts and Crafts exhibition, Quigly exhibited the Annunciation window, while also helping to organise the exhibition.[3] In the same year she showed three works with the RHA and was living at 14 Westmoreland Street. Between 1930 and 1934, she exhibited a further 7 works with the RHA. She continued to create commissions, including windows for the treasure house of Eu Tong Sen, a wealthy Singapore merchant, in 1927 she completed a window for the chapel at the Sacred Heart Convent, Newton, near Boston, Massachusetts, and in 1929 she created three of the decorative borders of the official handbook for Dublin civic week.[1]\n In 1932 she showed on portrait and four stained-glass panels at the Oireachtas art exhibition. After this Quigly emigrated to South Africa, where she lived for the rest of her life. At first she painted, exhibiting with Transvaal art society and the South African Academy in Johannesburg in 1935, 1936, and 1939. She began working with A. L. Watson in a stained glass studio after she settled in Johannesburg. From there she made over a hundred windows, and during the 1950s she is thought to be the only female stained glass artist in South Africa. She retired to Rhodesia, and died in Marandellas on 15 August 1981.[1]\n She is often listed as Kathleen Quigley, but she always signed her name as Quigly.[1] Some of her etching were included in The Ava Gallery 2014 exhibition, Irish Women Artists 1870\u20131970.[4][5]\n", " The 1989 Kent State Golden Flashes football team was an American football team that represented Kent State University  in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1989 NCAA Division I-A football season.

It is a prostrate shrub with glabrous branches and leaves and purple flowers. It occurs as a few scattered populations with a total area of less than 50\u00a0ha (100 acres).\n Eremophila prostrata is a prostrate shrub which sometimes forms mats 80\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) wide. New branches initially grow upwards but soon spread horizontally. The branches and leaves are glabrous and slightly sticky when young due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are oblong to elliptic in shape, mostly 24\u201342\u00a0mm (0.9\u20132\u00a0in) long, 1.6\u20133.0\u00a0mm (0.06\u20130.1\u00a0in) wide and have a distinct midrib on the lower surface and usually a few blunt teeth.[2][3][4]\n The flowers are usually borne singly, sometimes in groups of up to 3, in leaf axils on a hairy stalk 3.5\u201312\u00a0mm (0.1\u20130.5\u00a0in) long. There are 5 green to purplish, overlapping sepals which differ in shape from each other, ranging from egg-shaped to lance-shaped and from 10 to 13\u00a0mm (0.4 to 0.5\u00a0in) long. Both surfaces of the sepals are mostly glabrous except for the margins. The petals are 18\u201321\u00a0mm (0.7\u20130.8\u00a0in) long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube.  The petal tube is purple with darker bands inside the tube side walls. The outside of the petal lobes and most of the tube are hairy, the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from June to September and is followed by fruits which are oval-shaped to almost spherical, 7.5\u201311\u00a0mm (0.3\u20130.4\u00a0in) long and have a hairy, paper covering.[2][3][4]\n This species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae.[1] The specific epithet (prostrata) is a Latin word meaning \"down flat\", \"overthrown\" or \"laid low\".[5]\n Eremophila prostrata is only known from a total area of 50 hectares south of Alice Springs where it grows on sand plains and near sand hills.[2] Sometimes, especially after fire, thousands of individuals are seen but the plants seem to have a short life span and at 5 of the 7 known sites there were fewer than 50 individual plants in 2006.[4]\n Rainbow Valley fuchsia bush is classified as \"vulnerable\" by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.[3]\n Although not well known in cultivation, the masses of flowers of the dark purple form of this low, spreading shrub indicate its horticultural potential. It is fast-growing but short-lived and its requirements are not as yet well understood. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum, grows best in well-drained soils in a sunny position and is moderately drought and frost tolerant.[6]\n", " \n Katrina May Shanks (born 12 May 1969)[2][3] is a New Zealand politician who was a list member of parliament for the National Party from 2007 to 2014. Shanks became a Member of Parliament on 7 February 2007, following the resignation of Don Brash from Parliament.[4][5] She resigned from the 50th Parliament before the end of the parliamentary term, and her resignation became effective in January 2014.\n Shanks was born in Dannevirke in 1969, and attended St Matthew's Collegiate for Girls in Masterton and Dannevirke High School. She graduated with a Bachelor of Business Studies from Massey University.[2]\n Shanks' father, Graeme Hislop, twice stood against National Prime Minister Keith Holyoake as a Social Credit candidate, in 1975 and in the 1977 by-election.[6]\n[7]\n Prior to entering politics, Shanks worked as a self-employed accountant. She had previously worked as a project accountant for the Westpac Banking Corporation, in retail client services for Newton Investment Management in the United Kingdom, and as a senior auditor for Audit New Zealand.[8]\nShanks has three children.[9]\n Shanks joined the New Zealand National Party in 2001 as a member of the Karori branch and was a member of the party's executive committee for the Wellington Central electorate until 2004, when she joined the Ohariu-Belmont branch.\n Shanks sought the National party's nomination as their candidate for the Ohariu-Belmont electorate at the 2005 general election in 2004. She was one of two final challengers, along with Simon Wright.[10] Shanks was eventually confirmed by National Party Ohariu-Belmont electorate chairman Tony Heyward.[11]\n Shanks was placed 46th on the National party's list for the 2005 election.[12] In the electorate vote, she placed third behind the incumbent MP, United Future leader Peter Dunne and Labour's Charles Chauvel, with Shanks gaining 7,329 votes, a gain of 2% from the 2002 result for National candidate Dale Stevens. However, National's party vote within the electorate increased by nearly 19% and exceeded that of Labour (although they had also improved slightly on their 2002 result).[13]\n The initial results for the election on 17 September 2005 (election night) would have seen Shanks elected as a list MP; but the official count including special votes resulted in Shanks not going into Parliament on the list. The number of National list seats was reduced by one when the M\u0101ori Party share of the party vote rose above 2% and they were entitled to three not two seats from the party vote. They had won four electorate seats so the number of overhang seats in Parliament reduced from two to one. As National had the 120th seat allocated under the party vote, National lost one list seat that they appeared to have on election night. However Shanks' list position meant that if any National list MP resigned, Shanks would become the next National MP. This happened when former party leader Don Brash resigned on 7 February 2007.\n Shanks became her party's Associate Spokeswoman for Commerce and Associate Spokeswoman for Economic Development, as well as a member of the Social Services Select Committee, which she held for the remainder of the 48th Parliament.[2]\n Shanks, along with Dunne and Chauvel, contested the same seat again in 2008, within the newly named \u014chariu electorate (with modified boundaries from the former Ohariu-Belmont electorate). Shanks placed third again in the election, although National received 46.3% of the party vote in the electorate.[14]\n Shanks was again placed 46th on the party's list for the 2008 general election, and her party's result meant that she returned to Parliament. She was not offered a ministerial role as part of the new National Government.\n In 2013, Shanks was co-chairperson of the Regulations Review Select Committee, a member of the M\u0101ori Affairs Select Committee and also a member of the Justice and Electoral Select Committee in the 50th Parliament.[2]\n Shanks had an office in Johnsonville, Wellington, which was officially opened in September 2009 with Prime Minister John Key in attendance.[15]\n In April 2011, Shanks delivered a speech praising the pending anti-file-sharing copyright bill known as \"The Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Bill\". Opponents of the controversial bill quickly responded on Twitter and created YouTube parodies comparing Shanks' speech to a contestant's bumbling speech during the 2007 Miss Teen USA beauty pageant. The bill, which aims to prevent Internet piracy, passed overwhelmingly with a 111 to 11 vote.[16][17]\n Shanks originally planned to step down at the 2014 election,[18] but instead retired at the end of 2013 to become Chief Executive of the New Zealand Funeral Directors Association.\n[19] The resignation became effective on 21 January 2014,[20] and Shanks was succeeded as a list MP by Jo Hayes.\n", " Sweaty Betty is a British retailer specialising in women's activewear, founded by Tamara and Simon Hill-Norton.[1] The brand has been ensuring that 'style meets performance' in women's activewear for over 15 years, with the aim to \"inspire women to find empowerment through fitness\".[2] Sweaty Betty has over 50 boutiques in the United Kingdom, six boutiques in the United States and concessions in department stores Harrods and Bloomingdale's.\n Sweaty Betty was founded in 1998 by Tamara and Simon Hill-Norton with one boutique in London's Notting Hill.

The area of the city is around 60\u00a0km2. It borders the Blejoi village in the north, B\u0103rc\u0103ne\u0219ti and Brazi villages in the south, T\u00e2rg\u0219oru Vechi in the west and Bucov village in the east. Ploie\u0219ti has direct access to the Prahova Valley, one of the most important alpine tourism areas in Romania.\n Ploie\u0219ti is an important transport hub, linking Bucharest with Transylvania and Moldavia. According to the 2011 Romanian census, there were 201,226 people living within the city of Ploie\u0219ti, making it the 9th most populous in the country.\n Though likely settled much earlier, Ploie\u0219ti was first mentioned in documents in the 16th century, during the reign of Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave), Prince of Wallachia. It flourished as a center for trade and handicraft manufacturing in the 17th and 18th centuries. The road connecting Ploie\u0219ti to Bra\u0219ov opened in 1864, and the railway arrived in 1882. Many schools and hospitals date from this time.\n In the mid-19th century the Ploie\u0219ti region was one of the world's leading oil extraction and refinery sites. The world's first large refinery[8]\nopened at Ploie\u0219ti in 1856\u20131857 by Mehedin\u021beanu Brothers. The city is also remembered as the site of the self-styled Republic of Ploie\u0219ti, a short-lived 1870 revolt against the Romanian monarchy.\n Ploie\u0219ti's oil production made it a target during the invasion of Romania by the Central Powers in 1916, but a British Army operation under John Norton-Griffiths destroyed production and sabotaged much of the infrastructure of the industry.[9]\n Although badly damaged after the November 1940 earthquake, the city was a significant1 source of oil for Nazi Germany. The Allies made Ploie\u0219ti a target of the Oil campaign of World War II and attacked it repeatedly,[10] such as during the HALPRO and Operation Tidal Wave at a great loss, without producing any significant delay in operation or production.  Ploie\u0219ti was captured by Soviet troops in August 1944.\n Following the war, the new Communist regime nationalised the oil industry, which had largely been privately owned, and made massive investments in the oil and petroleum industry in a bid to modernise the country and repair the war damage.\n The population of Ploie\u0219ti went from 56,460, as indicated by the December 1912 census returns, up to 252,715 in January 1992. Since the fall of Communism, however, the city's population continues to gently fall due both to emigration and to a declining birth rate. At the 2002 census, the population reduced to 232,527.[11] As of 2011 census data, Ploie\u0219ti has a population of 197,542, while the proposed Ploie\u0219ti metropolitan area would have a population of 266,457.[1]\n The majority of the inhabitants are Romanians (90.64%), but a Roma minority (2.4%) is also present in several neighborhoods of the city, predominantly in Bereasca, Mimiu and Radu de la Afuma\u021bi.[12] For 6.65% of the population, the ethnicity is unknown.[13] Most of the people living in Ploie\u0219ti are Orthodox Christians (90.7%).[14]\n The population of Ploie\u0219ti grew at a rapid pace because of the intense economic development of the area. In 1810, during the years of the Ottoman occupation there were only around 2024 inhabitants in the present-day city. In 1837 this grew to 3,000 inhabitants, 11 years after the Union in 1859 the population was 26,458 while in 1884 the number stood at 32,000. During the early 20th century, the population of Ploie\u0219ti grew even more, due to the expansion of the petrol industry. Even though the city was bombed during the World War II, the population of Ploie\u0219ti recovered, numbering 95.632 inhabitants in January 1948.\n After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Ploie\u0219ti experienced rapid economic lost due to bad government and investments from foreign companies. The city is situated at just 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) north of Bucharest, with promising infrastructure projects currently underway. It is a strong industrial center, focused especially on the oil production and refining industry. Although oil production in the region is declining steadily, there is still a thriving processing industry with four operating oil refineries, linked by pipelines to Bucharest, the Black Sea port of Constan\u021ba and the Danube port of Giurgiu. Ploie\u0219ti also has a long history as a textile manufacturing center.\n The city has become a hub of foreign investment. Companies such as OMV-Petrom, Lukoil, Shell Gas, Timken, Yazaki, Coca-Cola, Efes Pilsener, British American Tobacco, Federal-Mogul, and Interbrew have operations there, and retailers like Carrefour, Metro, Selgros, Kaufland, Billa, Bricostore, Praktiker, Lidl, Obi, Auchan, Profi, Mega Image have found in Ploie\u0219ti a continuously growing market, but the pay rate for employees is lower than expected. There are three McDonald's restaurants in Ploie\u0219ti and three KFCs.\n The German retailer Tengelmann built a depot in Ploie\u0219ti to support a \u20ac200 million regional expansion plan. With its Interex (ro) operation, the French independent retailer Intermarch\u00e9 intends to become a distribution leader in the Balkans. In Romania the first Interex store was opened in June 2002 in Ploie\u0219ti. The Interex depot and facilities were bought by Penny Market XXL in 2014.[15]\n Unilever has a detergent plant in Ploie\u0219ti. By transferring their food production to Ploie\u0219ti, the company will concentrate all its activities in Romania at the same location. At the beginning of March 2006, Unilever announced they would invest money to build one production center in Romania, and the construction of the new food plant is part of this plan.[16]\n In 1950, as a milestone in the development of the petroleum, hydrocarbon processing, and petrochemical industries, the Engineering and Design Institute for Oil Refineries and Petrochemical Plants, SC IPIP SA, a Romanian company with a large range of capabilities and experience, was established at Ploie\u0219ti.\n In Ploie\u0219ti there are four local television channels: Ploie\u0219ti TV, Valea Prahovei TV, Wyll TV and Prahova TV.\n Ploie\u0219ti is situated on the A3 motorway (partially completed as of Spring 2014),[17] the main route to Romania's northern and western provinces and the Western EU. Henri Coand\u0103 International Airport is 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) distant, and the ski resorts of the Prahova Valley can be reached in an hour's drive. \nPloie\u0219ti is the second most important railway center in the country after Bucharest, linking Bucharest with Transylvania and Moldavia. The city's public transportation system is run by TCE Ploie\u0219ti and includes an extensive network of buses, trolleybuses and trams/streetcars. Ploie\u0219ti's distinctive yellow bus fleet is one of the most modern in Southeastern Europe, providing connections to all areas within the city, for a daily average of 150,000 passengers. The municipal roads comprise over 800 streets with a total length of 324\u00a0km (201\u00a0mi). Around 5,300 vehicles transit Ploie\u0219ti each day, with East and West ring belts diverting much traffic. The municipal vehicle fleet comprised 216 buses, 32 trams and 25 trolleybuses carrying about 70 millions passengers annually. There are 33 bus lines, with a total length of 415.46\u00a0km (258.15\u00a0mi); two trolley-bus lines having a total length of 19.9\u00a0km (12.4\u00a0mi) and two tram lines having a total length of 23.8\u00a0km (14.8\u00a0mi).[citation needed]\n Ploie\u0219ti is home to the Ploie\u0219ti Philharmonic Orchestra\u2014one of the top-rated philharmonic orchestras in Romania, a prominent football club, FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti, women handball club CSM Ploie\u0219ti from Liga Na\u021bional\u0103 and basketball team CSU Asesoft.\n There are many cultural and architectural monuments, including the Cultural Palace; the Clock Museum, featuring a collection of clocks and watches gathered by Nicolae Simache; the Oil Museum; the Art Museum of Ploie\u0219ti, donated by the Quintus family; and the Hagi Prodan Museum, dating to 1785: the property of a merchant named Ivan Hagi Prodan, it contains elements of old Romanian architecture and for a short time after World War I it hosted the first museum in Ploie\u0219ti, \"Prahova's Museum\".\nIn August 2011, Ploie\u0219ti hosted the Golden Carpathian European Film & Fair and Goran Bregovic concert.\n Several prominent writers have been affiliated with the city, including Ion Luca Caragiale, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Ioan A.

It lies close to the capital city Bucharest and it had close connections with the capital city throughout the centuries. Ploie\u0219ti lies at the 25\u00b0E meridian and the 44\u00b055\u2019N parallel (north). The city occupies a total surface of around 60\u00a0km2, out of which 35\u00a0km2 is suburban settlements. There exist two rivers in the proximity of the city: Prahova river, on the south-west, briefly passes through the city through the Brazi settlement and Teleajen River passes through the Blejoi, Bucov, Berceni villages. The city lies on D\u00e2mbu River, which springs from the hills around the B\u0103icoi town. Nowadays the D\u00e2mbu River doesn't have a high flow rate.\n The climate is similar to that of the nation's capital, Bucharest.  According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the city falls within the temperate humid continental climate(Dfa) of the hot summer type. The average annual temperature is 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C, with record minimum registered on 25 January 1952 of -30\u00a0\u00b0C while record maximum was registered on 19 July 2007 of 43\u00a0\u00b0C. On average, around 17 days are very cold, 26 cold, 99 warm and 30 tropical, while the rest have a moderate temperature.\n Average annual precipitations are 600\u00a0mm; 30\u201340\u00a0mm in January and 88\u00a0mm in June. Precipitations range between 963.9\u00a0mm registered in 1901 and 305.3\u00a0mm registered in 1930. Throughout the year, there are on average 104 days with rain, 26 with snow, 112 with clear skies, 131 with clouds and 122 with no sunshine. The climate of Ploie\u0219ti is influenced by the winds coming from north-east (40%) and south-east (23%), having an average speed of 3.1\u00a0m/s. On average, there are 11 days throughout the year with wind speed exceeding 11\u00a0m/s and only 2 days characterised by winds over 16\u00a0m/s. Atmospheric pressure is 748.2\u00a0mm.\n The city lies on the Romanian Plain, having an average altitude of 150m. The surrounding landscape is influenced by its position around the Prahova river, whose stream bed lies 25\u00a0km west. The Teleajen River passes through the city while the D\u00e2mbu River passes through the north-eastern neighbourhoods.\n The vegetation of Ploie\u0219ti used to be characterised by a plain forest, made up predominantly of pedunculate oak trees (Quercus robur). Other varieties of oak trees such as the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) also existed. Remnants of the old forest still exist and some trees are currently protected, such as two old oak trees in Ghighiu, on the southern periphery of the city.\n In current times the vegetation is typical of urban settlements, made up of ornamental plants, plantations of chestnuts, aspen and black locust. Parks and other green areas are limited: the main boulevard area, the park next to the Sala Sporturilor, the park from the northern part of the city, the \"Mihai Viteazul\" park and another park next to the Bucov barrier. These occupy only around 85.5 ha, resulting in 3.2 m2 of green space per inhabitant.\n Around the city one can also observe several endangered trees, which are protected by law. These include the giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) from the garden of the \"Paul Constantinescu\" museum. There also exist trees that have adapted to the local climate, such as figs. In some neighbourhoods more fruit trees and flowers are currently being planted.\n The Ploie\u0219ti City Council, elected in the 2016 local elections, is made up of 27 councillors, with the following party composition:\n There exist approximatively 88,104 flats that are located in 21,172 buildings. 93% of the households have access to clean water, 90% have access to the sewage network, 98% have access to electricity and 78% are connected to the district heating system.\n The metropolitan area of Ploie\u0219ti comprises 13 satellite towns.

Enroth (born October 28, 1938) has been a Professor of Sociology at Westmont College[1] in Santa Barbara, California, prominent evangelical Christian author of books concerning what he defines as \"cults\" and \"new religious movements\" and important figure in the Christian countercult movement.\n Enroth is a graduate of Houghton College and earned his M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Kentucky.[1] He began his career in teaching sociology during his doctoral studies, and held the post of an instructor at Westmont College from 1965-67. He was appointed as an assistant professor (1967\u201371), and then associate professor (1971\u201376) at Westmont. He became a full professor in 1976.\n Although Enroth's doctoral work was in the field of medical sociology, he has pursued research and teaching in the sociology of religion, new religious movements, social problems, and the sociology of deviant behavior. He holds memberships within four professional organizations: American Sociological Association, Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, American Academy of Religion, and the Association for the Sociology of Religion.\n Enroth won the Leo J. Ryan commemorative award in 1982.[2][3][4] He was the Social Science editor for the periodical the Christian Scholar's Review (1987\u20131990).[1] He has also served on the editorial advisory board of the secular anti-cult movement periodical the Cultic Studies Journal.[5] He also served for a number of years on the board of reference for the ministry the Spiritual Counterfeits Project in Berkeley, California. In 1987 he delivered the Tanner Annual Lecture at the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois. In 1994, Westmont College awarded Enroth twice for both Faculty Researcher of the Year and also Teacher of the Year in Social Sciences.[1]\n Enroth has written, co-written and edited a number of books and essays where he presents an evangelical interpretation of the sociology of cults and new religious movements. He has also written and edited works specifically concerned with the evangelization of adherents of cults.\n He was an early chronicler of the countercultural movement within evangelicalism that was known in the 1970s as the Jesus People movement or the Jesus revolution movement. His co-written book The Jesus People covered para-church organizations that held to Christian orthodox doctrines, and also examined controversial groups whose orthodoxy was open to dispute among evangelicals (such as the Children of God.)\n Another early work of his examined the emergence, sociology and theology of gay churches within Protestantism.\n In the late 1970s he wrote Youth, Brainwashing and the Extremist Cults, where he explored the dynamics of conversion and member participation through some case studies of various controversial minority religious groups such as: Hare Krishna (ISKCON), Children of God, Alamo Christian Foundation, the Love Family, the Unification Church, the Way International, and the Divine Light Mission. Enroth argued there were characteristics to cult commitment that were aberrant, such as the separation of youth from their families, intensive and manipulative activities of instruction and recruitment, and tests of loyalty to the group. He argued that the sociological and psychological processes of recruitment and indoctrination involved some form of brainwashing or mind control. The final part of his study explored the spiritual problems he discerned with cults from the standpoint of evangelical Christianity.\n Although Enroth argued in support of the brainwashing theory of cult conversions, he was nonetheless very critical of the tactics of secular anti-cult individuals who engaged in deprogramming. In the early 1980s Enroth criticized the views of the deprogrammer Ted Patrick. In an interview with Neil Duddy, Enroth rejected deprogramming as a remedy for dealing with cults. J. Gordon Melton also reported Enroth's views about opposing deprogramming in Christianity Today magazine.\n During the mid-1980s Enroth had a formal and frank exchange of views with J. Gordon Melton on a range of questions and methodological approaches to studying cults. This dialogue first appeared in an abridged version in Christianity Today in March 1984, and was then expanded into a book Why Cults Succeed Where The Church Fails. One of the important outcomes of this dialogue was an agreement between Enroth and Melton that a technically precise demarcation was needed to differentiate the Christian countercult movement from the secular anti-cult movement.\n Enroth complained that Melton, together with co-author Robert L. Moore, had lumped Christians in with secularists in their 1982 book The Cult Experience. Enroth also accused David Bromley, Anson Shupe, and Lowell Streiker, of committing the same error in their writings. Enroth stated: \"I recognize the distinction Gordon was mentioning between the Christian and the secular anticult movement, but he doesn't, unfortunately, make the distinction in his published writing. We're all painted with the same brush.\" (p.\u00a030). Melton, who acknowledged the distinct differences between the two movements, promised to rectify this point in his writings. In the 1986 edition of his Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America Melton introduced religious studies scholars to the neologism Christian countercult as a means of demarcating it from the secular anti-cult movement.\n During the late 1980s and early 1990s Enroth turned his attention on to the subject of marginal or fringe churches. In his studies Enroth has pinpointed church groups that operate outside mainstream denominations that promote a legalist understanding of the gospel, and operate with manipulative processes of membership. He discusses these problems in Churches That Abuse and Recovering from Churches That Abuse.\n Although Enroth has explored sociological questions in many of his books, he has also been an advocate of Christian evangelism toward members of so-called cults and new religious movements. In his book Evangelizing the Cults he recommends that Christians explain the gospel message to adherents. He emphasizes the role of prayer in this activity. Enroth urges Christians to adopt the style of evangelism used by St.Paul in his Areopagus speech in affirming the search while unwavering from the gospel.\n In his recent[when?] text A Guide to New Religious Movements, Enroth reiterates many of these points. However he also suggests that Christians follow the example set in Christian missions' literature of understanding the customs, culture and beliefs of groups and adopting a less confrontational attitude in evangelism and apologetics.\n In general, Enroth's writings have been acknowledged in Christian circles as significant contributions on the subject of \"cults\". In 1992 J. Gordon Melton made special mention of Enroth as an important figure in the Christian countercult movement. Unlike most of the apologists who concentrate on doctrinal questions, Enroth is distinguished as one of the few writers in the movement to both hold credentials in sociology and to apply sociological tools in his analyses. Melton stated that Enroth was \"the single most widely read of the Evangelical Christian counter-cult writers.\" [6]\n In 1993, Enroth's book Recovering from Churches That Abuse set off a \"firestorm of debate among religious scholars,\" centered around a chapter on the group Jesus People USA which included several stories of alleged abuse within the group.[7]\n James T. Richardson, former president of the Association for the Sociology of Religion and currently Professor of Sociology and Judicial Studies (University of Nevada, Reno), criticized Enroth's book and research methods in an issue of JPUSA's Cornerstone magazine, writing in part:\n Enroth's book can be viewed as another in a long line of popular books that teach people how to become good victims by reinterpreting their past. Ironically, this thoroughly non-sociological book makes use of a sociological truth--that people are constantly reinterpreting their past to make their view of that past more functional for their present--as he delivers the message that people's problems are not really their fault. Someone else is always to blame. This line of thought is controversial from several perspectives, of course, including the theological and the therapeutic. ... Enroth reminds the reader several times that he is a sociologist, thus implying that he is doing sociology in the book, but this slim volume is not sociological. There is no attempt to sample properly, or to limit generalizations in any explicit way. There is no effort to discuss the issue of self-serving accounts that plague all such books of this 'anticult' bent, and there is a glossing over of the writer's own particular religious persuasion. Furthermore, there is virtually no recognition of the considerable scholarly research that might be used to counter the apparent thesis of Enroth, who seems to believe that religious groups that require heavy discipline and commitment should be avoided in favor of less demanding mainstream groups.[8] JPUSA elders, who attempted to convince Enroth to remove the chapter prior to the release of the book, referred to the chapter as \"poison in the well.\" Ruth Tucker, a professor at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School also defended JPUSA saying Enroth was \"sadly misdirected and his research methods seriously flawed.\"[7]\n In defense of Enroth's work, Paul R. Martin, the director of Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center, one of the few residential treatment centers in the world for former members of cults and \"abusive groups,\" supported Enroth's findings, saying that his facility had seen a flood of requests for help from former members and that JPUSA \"displays virtually every sign that I watch for in overly authoritarian and totalistic groups.\"[7]\n Ronald Enroth himself responded to the controversy (some of which had occurred prior to the release of the book) in the book itself, in part with:\n There has been much correspondence between leaders of the Covenant Church and JPUSA and me since I began to do the research for this book. They have questioned the integrity of my reports, the reliability of my respondents, and my sociological methodology, but I have conducted more than seventy hours of in-depth interviews and telephone conversations with more than forty former members of JPUSA. They have also largely discounted the reports of abusive conditions past and present in the JPUSA community. ... Unwilling to admit serious deficiencies and insensitivity in their pastoral style, the leaders of JPUSA have instead sought to discredit the former members who have cooperated with my research efforts.[9] As a result of the book's chapter on JPUSA, according to a later newspaper article, \"scores\" of members read it and decided to leave the group.[10]\n Enroth has written and edited the following books:[11]\n", " The Uncollected Wodehouse is a collection of early newspaper and magazine articles and short stories by P.

The period is also known as Pitru Pakshya, Pitri Pokkho, Sola Shraddha/ Sorha Shraddha in Nepali (\"sixteen shraddhas\"), Kanagat, Jitiya, Mahalaya Paksha and Apara paksha.[3][4][5]\n Pitru Paksha is considered by Hindus to be inauspicious, given the death rite performed during the ceremony, known as Shraddha or Tarpan. In southern and western India, it falls in the 2nd paksha (fortnight) Hindu lunar month of Bhadrapada (September) and follows the fortnight immediately after the Ganesh festival. It begins on the Pratipada (first day of the fortnight) ending with the no moon day known as Sarvapitri amavasya, Pitru Amavasya, Peddala Amavasya, Mahalaya amavasya or simply Mahalaya. Most years, the autumnal equinox falls within this period, i.e. the Sun transitions from the northern to the southern hemisphere during this period. In North India and Nepal, and cultures following the purnimanta calendar or the solar calendar, this period may correspond to the waning fortnight of the luni-solar month Ashvin, instead of Bhadrapada. It is similar to Ghost Festival observed by Chinese people. In Chinese culture, the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar is called Ghost Day and the seventh month in general is regarded as the Ghost Month (\u9b3c\u6708), in which ghosts and spirits, including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the lower realm.[6][circular reference]\n According to Hinduism, the souls of three preceding generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru\u2013loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes the soul of a dying man from earth to Pitru\u2013loka. When a person of the next generation dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru\u2013loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role.[7] According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Virgo (Kanya). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru\u2013loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiac\u2014Scorpio (Vrichchhika)\u2014and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.[4][8]\n When the legendary donor Karna died in the epic Mahabharata war, his soul transcended to heaven, where he was offered gold and jewels as food. However, Karna needed real food to eat and asked Indra, the lord of heaven, the reason for serving gold as food. Indra told Karna that he had donated gold all his life, but had never donated food to his ancestors in Shraddha. Karna said that since he was unaware of his ancestors, he never donated anything in their memory. To make amends, Karna was permitted to return to earth for a 15\u2013day period, so that he could perform Shraddha and donate food and water in their memory. This period is now known as Pitru Paksha.[9] In some legends, Yama replaces Indra.[10]\n The performance of Shraddha by a son during Pitru Paksha is regarded as compulsory by Hindus, to ensure that the soul of the ancestor goes to heaven. In this context, the scripture Garuda Purana says, \"there is no salvation for a man without a son\".[7] The scriptures preach that a householder should propitiate ancestors (Pitris), along with the gods (devas), ghosts (bhutas) and guests.[3] The scripture Markandeya Purana says that if the ancestors are content with the shraddhas, they will bestow health, wealth, knowledge and longevity, and ultimately heaven and salvation (moksha) upon the performer.[4]\n The performance of Sarvapitri amavasya rites can also compensate a forgotten or neglected annual Shraddha ceremony, which should ideally coincide with the death anniversary of the deceased. According to Sharma, the ceremony is central to the concept of lineages. Shraddha involves oblations to three preceding generations\u2014by reciting their names\u2014as well as to the mythical lineage ancestor (gotra). A person thus gets to know the names of six generations (three preceding generation, his own and two succeeding generations\u2014his sons and grandsons) in his life, reaffirming lineage ties.[3] Anthropologist Usha Menon of Drexel University presents a similar idea\u2014that Pitru Paksha emphasises the fact that the ancestors and the current generation and their next unborn generation are connected by blood ties. The current generation repays their debt to the ancestors in the Pitru Paksha. This debt is considered of utmost importance along with a person's debt to his gurus and his parents.[11]\n The shraddha is performed on the specific lunar day during the Pitru Paksha, when the ancestor\u2014usually a parent or paternal grandparent\u2014died. There are exceptions to the lunar day rule; special days are allotted for people who died in a particular manner or had a certain status in life. Chautha Bharani and Bharani Panchami, the fourth and fifth lunar day respectively, are allocated for people deceased in the past year. Avidhava navami (\"Unwidowed ninth\"), the ninth lunar day, is for married women who died before their husband. Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife's shraddha. The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures. The fourteenth day is known as Ghata chaturdashi or Ghayala chaturdashi, and is reserved for those people killed by arms, in war or suffered a violent death.[4][7]\n Sarvapitri amavasya (all ancestors' new moon day) is intended for all ancestors, irrespective of the lunar day they died. It is the most important day of the Pitru Paksha.[4][7] Those who have forgotten to perform shraddha can do so on this day. A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as fruitful as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya, which is seen as a special place to perform the rite, and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period.[5]\n In Bengal, Mahalaya (Bengali: \u09ae\u09b9\u09be\u09b2\u09af\u09bc\u09be) marks the beginning of Durga Puja festivities. Mahalaya is the day when the goddess Durga is believed to have descended to Earth. Bengali people traditionally wake up early in the morning on Mahalaya to recite hymns from the Devi Mahatmya (Chandi) scripture. Offerings to the ancestors are made in homes and at puja mandaps (temporary shrines).[12][13]\n Matamaha (\"Mother's father\") or Dauhitra (\"Daughter's son\") also marks the first day of the month of Ashvin and beginning of the bright fortnight. It is assigned for the grandson of the deceased maternal grandfather.[4][7]\n The ritual is also held on the death anniversary of the ancestor. The shraddha is performed only at noon, usually on the bank of a river or lake or at one's own house.[7] Families may also make a pilgrimage to places like Varanasi and Gaya to perform Shraddha.[4][5][14] An annual Pitri Paksha Mela at Gaya on the banks of River Falgu. Pilgrims from all corners of the country visit Gaya for offering Pinda to their Ancestors.  According to Bihar Tourism Department estimates, some 5,00,000 to 75,00,000 pilgrims arrive in the Gaya city during the Pitri Paksha Mela every year.[15]\n It is essential that Shraddha be performed by the son\u2014usually the eldest\u2014or male relative of the paternal branch of the family, limited to the preceding three generations. However, on Sarvapitri amavasya or matamaha, the daughter's son can offer Shraddha for the maternal side of his family if a male heir is absent in his mother's family.[4][7] Some castes only perform the shraddha for one generation.[4] Prior to performing the rite, the male should have experienced a sacred thread ceremony. Since the ceremony is considered inauspicious due to its association with death, the royal family of Kutch, the king or heirs of the throne are prohibited from conducting Shraddha.[7]\n The food offerings made to the ancestors are usually cooked in silver or copper vessels and typically placed on a banana leaf or cups made of dried leaves. The food must include Kheer (a type of sweet rice and milk), lapsi (a sweet porridge made of wheat grains), rice, dal (lentils), the vegetable of spring bean (guar) and a yellow gourd (pumpkin).[7]\n The male who performs the shraddha should take a purifying bath beforehand and is expected to wear a dhoti. He wears a ring of darbha grass. Then the ancestors are invoked to reside in the ring. The shraddha is usually performed bare-chested, as the position of the sacred thread worn by him needs to be changed multiple times during the ceremony. The shraddha involves pinda-daan, which is an offering to the ancestors of pindas (cooked rice and barley flour balls mixed with ghee and black sesame seeds), accompanying the release of water from the hand. It is followed by the worship of Vishnu (in form of the darbha grass, a gold image, or Shaligram stone) and Yama. The food offering is then made, cooked especially for the ceremony on the roof. The offering is considered to be accepted if a crow arrives and devours the food; the bird is believed to be a messenger from Yama or the spirit of the ancestors.[4] A cow and a dog are also fed, and Brahmin priests are also offered food. Once the ancestors (crow) and Brahmins have eaten, the family members can begin lunch.[7]\n Some families also conduct ritual recitals of scriptures such the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita.[7][16] Others may be charitable and present gifts to the priests or pay them to recite prayers for the ancestor's well-being.[16]\n \n \n", " Murong Hui (\u6155\u5bb9\u6703) (373\u2013397) was a general and imperial prince of the Xianbei state Later Yan, who served under his grandfather Murong Chui (Emperor Wucheng) and father Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin).  During his father's reign, angry that he was not created crown prince, he tried to seize that position by force, but after his failure was killed.\n Murong Hui was born to Murong Bao and a concubine described as of lowly birth while Murong Bao was a low-level Former Qin official, after Murong Chui, a Former Yan prince, had sought refuge with Former Qin's emperor Fu Ji\u0101n in 369 after a dispute with Former Yan's Empress Kezuhun and regent Murong Ping, and after Former Qin had destroyed Former Yan in 370.  He was therefore probably born in the Former Qin capital Chang'an, where Murong Bao served.\n When Murong Chui rebelled against Former Qin in 384 and established Later Yan, Murong Hui was in Chang'an, then still under Former Qin control.  After the last Former Yan emperor Murong Wei, then a Former Qin general, tried to rebel within the city around the new year 385, Fu Ji\u0101n ordered the Xianbei in the city killed, but Murong Hui, along with his uncle Murong Rou (\u6155\u5bb9\u67d4) and brother Murong Sheng, were not killed, apparently because Murong Rou had been adopted by the eunuch Song Ya (\u5b8b\u7259).  Soon thereafter, though, Murong Rou, Murong Sheng, and Murong Hui fled Chang'an and sought refuge with Murong Wei's brother and the leader of the nascent Western Yan state, Murong Chong.\n Western Yan eventually captured Chang'an, but Murong Chong was killed in a coup, and the Xianbei people of the state abandoned Chang'an and began heading east back to their homeland.  After a series of coups in 386, Murong Yong became emperor, and under his leadership Western Yan settled in at Zhangzi (\u9577\u5b50, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi).  In winter 386, Murong Sheng saw that they were being suspected by Murong Yong on account of their being descendants of Murong Chui, and therefore persuaded Murong Rou and Murong Hui to flee to Later Yan.  It took them a year to arrive in the Later Yan capital Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71, in modern Baoding, Hebei), and upon arrival in the capital, Murong Hui was created the Duke of Qinghe.\n Murong Chui greatly favored Murong Hui's abilities, and whenever Murong Bao, then Murong Chui's crown prince, would accompany Murong Chui on campaigns, Murong Chui put Murong Hui in charge of the crown prince's household, and ordered that he accorded the same respect as the crown prince during those times.  In 395, after Murong Bao had suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Later Yan's former vassal, Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui, in preparation of another attack against Northern Wei, Murong Chui recalled Murong Hui's uncle Murong Long, the viceroy at the old Former Yan capital Longcheng (\u9f8d\u57ce, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning), to the capital with his troops, and he made Murong Hui viceroy at Longcheng.  He grew extremely ill in early 396, however, and died during the campaign and was succeeded by Murong Bao.\n Before Murong Chui died, he urged Murong Bao to make Murong Hui crown prince.  However, Murong Bao favored his young son Murong Ce (\u6155\u5bb9\u7b56, 13 years Murong Hui's junior) and did not consider Murong Hui.  Murong Sheng, who was slightly older than Murong Hui, also did not want to see Murong Hui as crown prince, and therefore persuaded Murong Bao to create Murong Ce crown prince.  Murong Hui was only promoted to Prince of Qinghe, and he resented this greatly.\n Later in 396, Northern Wei launched a major attack on Later Yan, immediately seizing most of the central and western provinces of the empire, and putting Zhongshan under siege.  Murong Hui mobilized his troops under guise of heading for his father's aid, but did not actually have the desire to do so, and so advanced slowly only after the urging of the general Yu Chong (\u9918\u5d07).  As he reached Zhongshan's vicinity, his father abandoned Zhongshan and joined his army.  Murong Bao immediately saw that Murong Hui was still resentful, and tried to transfer the command of the army to his own brothers Murong Long and Murong Nong, but this only angered Murong Hui more.  Seeing his uncles as his threats, he sent assassins against them, killing Murong Long but only wounding Murong Nong, and then falsely accused Murong Long and Murong Nong of treason.  Murong Bao initially pretended to believe him, and then tried to have him assassinated but failed.  Murong Hui then rose in open rebellion, demanding the position of crown prince, and as Murong Bao had then reached Longcheng first, Murong Hui tried to put Longcheng under siege.  The general Gao Yun, however, led a surprise attack against him, and his troops collapsed.  He fled back to Zhongshan, then under the control of his cousin Murong Xiang (\u6155\u5bb9\u8a73) the Duke of Kaifeng, but Murong Xiang executed him.  Murong Bao executed his mother and sons as well.\n", " \n See text\n Bryanthus is a genus of ornamental plant in the Ericaceae family of flowering plants.[1] In 2012, the new tribe Bryantheae was proposed based on genetic analysis, containing the genera Bryanthus and Ledothamnus.[2]\n \n", " Perkinsville is a village in County Durham, in England.

This work provided detailed instructions on how to measure distances and heights with tall surveyor's poles and horizontal bars fixed at right angles to them. The unit of measurement was 1 li = 180 zhang= 1800chi, 1 zhang = 10 chi, 1 chi = 10 cun, 1 step(bu) = 6 chi. Calculation was carried out with place value decimal Rod calculus.\n Liu Hui used his rectangle in right angle triangle theorem as the mathematical basis for survey. With his \"In-out-complement\" principle, he\nproved that the area of two inscribed rectangles in the two complementary right angle triangles have equal area, thus\n Q: Now surveying a sea island, set up two three zhang poles at one thousand steps apart, let the two poles and the island in a straight line. Step back from the front post 123 steps, with eye on ground level, the tip of the pole is on a straight line with the peak of island. Step back 127 steps from the rear pole, eye on ground level also aligns with the tip of pole and tip of island. What is the height of the island, and what is the distance to the pole\u00a0?\n A: The height of the island is four li and 55 steps, and it is 120 li and 50 steps from the pole.\n Algorithm: Let the numerator equals to the height of pole multiplied by the separation of poles, let denominator be the difference of offsets, add the quotient to the height of pole to obtain the height of island.\n As the distance of front pole to the island could not be measured directly, Liu Hui set up two poles of same height at a known distance apart\nand made two measurements. The pole was perpendicular to the ground, eye view from ground level when the tip of pole was on a straight line sight with the peak of island, the distance of eye to the pole was called front offset =DG, similarly, the back offset =FH, difference of offsets =FH-DG.\n Using his principle of inscribe rectangle in right angle triangle for ABG and ABH, he obtained:\n A  pine of unknown height on a hill.  Set up two poles of  two zhang each,  one at front and one at the rear 50 steps in between. Let the rear pole aligns with the front pole. Step back 7 steps and 4 chi, view the tip of  pine tree from the ground till it aligns in a  straight line with the tip of the pole. Then view the tree trunk,  the line of sight intersects the poles at  2 chi and 8 cun  from its tip . Step back 8 steps and 5 chi from the rear pole,  the  view from ground also aligns with tree top and pole top.  What is the height of the pine tree, and what is its distance from the pole\u00a0?\nAnswer: the height of the pine is 11 zhang 2 chi 8 cun, the distance of mountain from the pole is 1 li and 28  and four seventh steps.\n Algorithm:  let the numerator be the product of separation of the poles and  intersection from tip of pole, let the denominator be the difference of offsets.

Throughout his life he suffered from severe mental distress, experiencing symptoms related to autism and schizophrenia.[1] On account of his passion for trains, buses, and train stations, he called himself the \"King of Stations\".[2]\n Van Genk's panoramic cityscapes and fragmented collages express his feelings about modern authority, feelings which were shaped by an abusive father who, in addition to administering his own beatings, left him exposed to a traumatic experience at the hands of the Gestapo during the German occupation of the Netherlands in the Second World War.[3]\n Van Genk's art has been widely exhibited in Europe, where it is also in many museum collections, including those of the Stedelijk Museum, the Dr. Guislain Museum in Ghent, the Collection de l\u2019Art Brut in Lausanne, the Lille Metropole Musee d\u2019Art Modern, d\u2019Art Contemporain et d\u2019Art Brut (LaM), the Croatian Museum of Na\u00efve Art in Zagreb,and the Museum of Everything in London.[4]\nRaw Vision, the leading magazine covering Art Brut, ranks van Genk among the \"masters of outsider art\".[5] At the beginning of 2005, the year of the artist's death, van Genk's Keleti Station, now in the collection of the Museum of Everything in London, sold for a hundred thousand dollars at New York's Outsider Art Fair, thus setting the record for most expensive work ever sold by a living outsider artist.[6] On that occasion, Roberta Smith, the chief art critic of The New York Times, praised the piece \"as the leading candidate for best in show\".[2] At least one other critic has identified van Genk as the most important Dutch outsider artist.[7]\n Willem van Genk: Mind Traffic, the first solo exhibition of the artist in the United States, was presented from September 10 through November 30, 2014, at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City.[8][9]\n Willem van Genk was born in 1927 in Voorburg, Netherlands. When he was five, his mother died, leaving the young boy dependent on his abusive father and, especially, his nine sisters. In school Willem was a poor student, except in art; playing to his strength, he preferred to doodle throughout the day instead of paying attention in class. He was especially weak in mathematics, which outraged his father, who forced Willem to add and subtract the number of blows as he beat him.[10]\nWillem was expelled from primary school, and then failed at vocational school. He also began a sign-painting course, but did not finish it. These early failures and abuses fostered an inferiority complex, from which art was the only outlet.[11] In art van Genk was exceptionally skilled, and he would use his skill to assume the perspective of a godlike overseer of the modern metropolis.[12]\nDuring the Second World War, the Netherlands were occupied by Nazi Germany. Van Genk's father was a member of the Dutch resistance, and hid Jews in the family home. Maddeningly, their fate is not recorded in the literature on the artist.[13] In 1944 when Willem was seventeen years old, the Gestapo visited the family apartment in the Magnoliastraat in search of the father, who was not there. In his stead Willem was interrogated by the Gestapo, who beat the adolescent, subjecting him, in the words of his eldest sister, to \"a few heavy clouts.\"[14] This trauma was the origin of van Genk's later obsession with long raincoats, as the Gestapo men on this occasion wore \"high-buttoned leather jackets.\"[15] This was a formative event in van Genk's life. As though appropriating their cloaks of power, van Genk would eventually collect hundreds of long raincoats, which he treated as a sort of fetish, a prophylactic protecting the paranoid artist against what he thought of as the ubiquitous threat of his enemies.\n When van Genk's father married for a third time after the war, he threw his troubled son out of the house.[16] Eventually, after years in a lodging house, van Genk moved in with his sister Willy in The Hague in 1964, and stayed put after her death in 1973, living alone for all but the end of the rest of his life in this modest dwelling in the Harmelenstraat.[17]\n Willem van Genk originally pursued his talent as a draftsman in an advertising agency. He delivered work of good quality, but he was nonetheless fired, because he could not maintain a regular working schedule and abide deadlines. He also would spend hours observing trains during work time.[18] After losing his job he was forced to slave away at pointless tasks in something like a Victorian workhouse for the Dutch disabled.[19] This compulsory labor was known as \"labor for the inferior,\" a derogatory term which haunted the artist the rest of his life. Van Genk told his friend Dick Walda: \"I have never gotten over it, I think. Being labelled as 'inferior'. The bosses there make sure you know about it. They're more like concentration camp bullies than bosses.\"[20]  The experience was degrading, and van Genk took it as justification for his paranoia. At this time he first received help for his mental problems, but thereafter he still often suffered paranoid episodes and heard unreal voices.[21]\nIn the year 1958 he registered with the Royal Academy in The Hague. The director Joop Beljon recognized immediately the quality of his work, but also that the young artist was beyond the reach of the faculty's lessons. At the director's suggestion van Genk was allowed to take his own path at the academy, and consequently he remained an autodidact.[22] At this time van Genk was noticed for the first time, with the journalist R.E. Penning praising his work as \"panoramas of Lilliput towns as seen by Gulliver.\"[23]\n In 1964, Beljon organized the first solo exhibition of van Genk's work in Hilversum.[22] The Dutch writer W.F. Hermans opened the show and commented that his works \u201care frighteningly beautiful, but they will remind many of something they would rather forget.\u201d[24] But high prices meant few sales, and mixed publicity, some of which insulted the artist's mental capacities, partly motivated van Genk's withdrawal from this early public attention.[12] Furthermore, he was his own harshest critic, unable to bear the sound of his recorded voice. A television interview to publicize the exhibition so horrified the artist that for decades he refused to be filmed, photographed, or taped.[25] Van Genk's inferiority complex was thus a major impediment to the development of his career as an artist.\n Van Genk withdrew from publicity, but continued to work and exhibit. In 1966 eight works sold at a show by the Galerie Alfred Schmela in D\u00fcsseldorf; notably, the prestigious Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam's museum of modern art, bought van Genk's painting Metrostation Opera.[25]\nWith his successes in the mid-1960s, van Genk was finally able to indulge his passionate interest in cities by visiting them in person. His art through 1960 was devoted to relatively straightforward panoramic depictions of cityscapes, views that the artist culled from the printed material he perused, such as travel guides, postcards, and magazines. Now he visited many cities, including Stockholm, Madrid, Rome, Moscow, Budapest, Frankfurt, and wall-divided Berlin.[26] Landmark architecture from these cities, especially train stations, feature in many works by the artist.\n In the 1970s van Genk's career as an artist continued with modest success. He was included at the D\u00fcsseldorf IKI art fair in 1974, but nothing of his sold. Initially represented by Pieter Brattinga,[27] by the 1970s van Genk was represented by the gallery De Ark. The gallery's last show in 1976 before being taken over by the Hamer Gallery, which continued to represent the artist, was devoted to van Genk's work.[28] Also in 1976 van Genk was included in two group shows devoted to \u201cna\u00efve\u201d art, in Amsterdam and Haarlem respectively.[29] He was included in Nederlandse Naieve Kunst (\u201cDutch Na\u00efve Art\u201d), a volume surveying fourteen figures, with van Genk's work represented by three color reproductions.[30]\nIn the 1980s van Genk achieved a new height of international recognition. In 1984 he was included in the World Encyclopedia of Na\u00efve Art, with almost a full-page reproduction of his painting Madrid, which the Collection de l\u2019Art Brut in Lausanne acquired the same year along with a second work, \u201c50 Years of the Soviet Union,\u201d for \u201c2,500 and 3,000 guilders respectively,\u201d relatively modest sums which angered the artist against his dealer Nico Van Der Endt.[31]  The following year the Collection de l\u2019Art Brut acquired three works on paper by the artist, marking a commitment to represent his work in depth that culminated in a major exhibition of the museum's collection in 1986, which \u201cestablishe(d) Van Genk\u2019s international reputation.\u201d[32] The show was a critical success in the Francophone lands of Europe, and London's prestigious Southbank Centre responded to the show by borrowing three works by van Genk for a travelling exhibition called \u201cIn Another World,\u201d which toured across Britain.[32]\n Now with his reputation securely established, van Genk's prices continued to rise while his works continued to be exhibited, both in several group exhibitions and no less than four monographic exhibitions just in the 1990s. Yet this burgeoning success did not satisfy van Genk's wish to live a normal life. By 1995 he was becoming increasingly withdrawn, a recluse holed up in his apartment, where he was the subject of many complaints from his neighbors, who objected to the awful smells and loud nocturnal \u201cthumping\u201d emanating therefrom.[33]\nThe following year in 1996 van Genk was involuntarily seized by the police from his Hague apartment and committed to a sanatorium. A police officer commented to van Genk's dealer, Nico van der Endt, whom the artist had desperately summoned to the scene: \u201cWe know all about Mr Van Genk. His file\u2019s a metre thick.\u201d[34] The floor of the apartment was found \u201calmost entirely covered with a thin layer of dog faeces, stamped thin and dried out.\u201d[35] The authorities killed van Genk's dog Coco, who was evidently not housebroken. After three months, van Genk was released and allowed to return home, but his apartment, which had been such a peculiar live-in Gesamtkunstwerk, had been drastically transformed by cleaning, to the violated artist's chagrin. Not long thereafter, the police again involuntarily seized van Genk, who was placed under \u2018compulsory psychiatric treatment for a maximum of six months because he was charged for the \u201cnuisance caused to neighbors.\u201d\u2019[36] The approbation of the art world had not entailed the wider social acceptance of this troubled, difficult figure.\n The year after his involuntary commitment, he suffered a first stroke.[37] That same year, 1997, the artist made his last drawing, thus closing his career as an artist. That year also saw the publication of the first monographic account of the artist\u2019s career, Dick Walda\u2019s book Koning der stations, along with the preparation of another monographic catalogue to accompany a retrospective exhibition, Ans Van Berkum\u2019s Willem van Genk: A Marked Man and his World. The retrospective exhibition that Van Berkum\u2019s monograph accompanied opened at De Stadshof (now defunct) in Zwolle the following year in 1998, then travelled to B\u00f6nnigheim and Lausanne. But before this exhibition opened, van Genk suffered another stroke while travelling in Stockholm; this would be the last of his travels. In 1998, as the De Stadshof Museum was negotiating the purchase of ten works by Willem van Genk for the impressive sum of 225,000 guilders (in anticipation of the retrospective exhibition and book publication), the artist himself was committed to a nursing home.[38] Months before the artist\u2019s death of heart failure in 2005, his picture Keleti Station sold for $100,000, which made the moribund artist \u201cthe most expensive living outsider artist.\u201d[39]\n Van Genk's life and work is of special interest to those fascinated by the relationship between mental illness and artistic creativity. Like other famous Outsider Artists such as Adolf W\u00f6lfli and Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez, van Genk suffered from extreme mental distress. Ever since the early 1920s, when Hans Prinzhorn published his study on The Artistry of the Mentally Ill (which was quickly adopted as an inspiration by the Surrealists in Paris), the artwork of the mentally ill has been a topic of considerable interests to artists, scholars, and the public at large. Yet this history is as marred by invidious classifications as it is marked by uplifting respect for the creativity of suffering eccentrics. Van Genk himself was notably interested in this subject, which he experienced as an insulting challenge to his existence as an artist. He owned Johannes H. Plokker's Art from the Mentally Disturbed: The Shattered Vision of Schizophrenics in no fewer than three languages. In his rather polemical study Plokker denies the ability of the mentally ill to make real art, which Plokker argues presupposes an \u201cintegrated personality.\u201d[40] The severity of this judgment, which takes refuge in incredibly neat distinctions between the sick and healthy, goaded van Genk on, worsening his persecution complex yet motivating him to disprove his enemies by creating his art.\n Willem van Genk suffered from symptoms related to autism and paranoid schizophrenia.[41] Even before his traumatic adolescent incident at the hands of the Gestapo, young Willem had great difficulty learning in certain subjects, yet some perceived his remarkably tangled talent. Then the experience with the Gestapo, compounded by abuse from his father, contributed to a lifelong paranoia, which in turn became a defining characteristic of his art. Van Genk's fear of authority was arguably at least partly justified by traumas inflicted upon him: childhood abuse by his father and the Gestapo, involuntary servitude in a workhouse for the mentally handicapped as a young adult, then ultimately his two arrests and involuntary commitments to psychiatric care as an old man. But if he had good reason to feel himself persecuted by powerful figures and bureaucracies, the consequence was undeniably a maladjusted, antisocial paranoia, such that, to cite the most striking example, his apartment was discovered carpeted by a layer of dog excrement.\n The artist suffered from a variety of symptoms. He repeatedly confessed to hearing unreal voices\u2014a classic symptom of schizophrenia.[21] He was quite lonely, once telling his dealer Nico Van Der Endt, whom he addressed in the third person, \"Nico Van Der Endt is the most solid comrade I\u2019ve got, and that\u2019s purely on a commercial basis.\u201d[32]  He also suffered from a hoarding compulsion, in evidence not only in his obsessive collecting of raincoats (eventually numbering in the hundreds) but also in his reluctance to part with his own work.[42]\n The artist was also afflicted with sexual anxieties: in 1987 he complained that the proliferation of hair salons across The Hague was \u201crestricting his freedom of movement. The sight of long hair in frothy shampoo arouse(d) sexual feelings that he ha(d) difficulty keeping under control\u2026\u201d[43] The following year in 1988 van Genk made a painting called The Hairdresser\u2019s Salon, a composite image divided by a grid into 32 equally sized squares, with macabre imagery suggesting, in conjunction with his revealing comment, a fear of women.\n Van Genk's sexual frustration was variously expressed. In 1980 he commented: \u201cIf they take my dog away, I\u2019ll molest the little boys.\u201d[44] Later he complained, \u201cYou\u2019re discriminated against because you don\u2019t have a little lady friend, they think you\u2019re a fairy, there are two gays living in my street, and the thing is, they look down at you too, you can\u2019t expect anything from them either.\u201d[43] Prompted by such comments, as well as the inscription \u2018\u201cArtistic\u201d homosexual in the Ark\u2019 (originally in Dutch, \u2018\u201cArtistieke\u2019 homophiel in de Ark\u2019) in van Genk's Self-portrait in the Ark (\"Zelfportrait in de Ark\"), Van Der Endt confronted the artist:  \u201cSo you\u2019re a homosexual?\u201d The artist replied, \u201cNo, no, that was a mistake.\u201d[36] Whatever the mystery of Van Genk's desire really was, sadly it was not resolved in his lifetime.[45]\nNico Van Der Endt suggests that the artist's libido was displaced onto fetish objects, and that van Genk was especially  \u201caroused\u201d by trains and raincoats.[46] Van Der Endt has also made the related suggestion that van Genk's work is loaded with sexual subtexts: trains and zeppelins as phallic symbols of potency, raincoats as condom-like prophylactics, and more. This sexualized reading, though it may indeed clarify the artist's confused and frustrated feelings, is inadequate as an explanation of the artist's conscious intentions. Van Der Endt himself explicitly allows that it is \u201cimpossible to offer one comprehensive interpretation,\u201d but claims that essentially \u201chis work is concerned with order, power and impotence.\u201d[47]\n Van Genk occupies a paradoxical position as one of the official masters of Outsider Art. Raw Vision, the leading magazine devoted to the subject, has twice included van Genk on its list of masters, and the artist has been the subject of considerable attention from European museums devoted to Outsider Art/Art Brut.[48] In 2014 was the subject of an exhibition at the American Folk Art Museum, the leading American museum in this field.\n Van Genk the man was certainly an outsider, with his mental difficulties resulting in his social marginalization. As a boy he repeatedly failed in schools, as a young man he was forced into compulsory labor for the disabled, and as an old man he was at least twice involuntarily committed to psychiatric institutions. He complained of his friendlessness. In the straightforward, common sense of the word, there can be no denying that, as a person, van Genk was an outsider.\n Yet his status as an Outsider Artist was questioned by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) on the occasion of its survey exhibition \u201cParallel Visions\u201d in 1992, when the museum held van Genk's partial success in achieving official recognition against him. Van Genk, with his hoarding compulsion, hated to part with his work: one monograph claims that he felt parting with a painting was like having a limb amputated.[49]  Yet he also desired official recognition, so his dealer devised a strategy of dissemination whereby, on the rare occasion when the dealer was allowed to sell a work, it was invariably to a museum. According to LACMA this strategic dissemination of works to museums, in order to maintain a minimal livelihood for the artist and elevate his status, violated \u201ca basic criterion: outsider art must not be created for the public.\u201d[50] If accepted, however, this exclusion would place van Genk outside any clear categorization as an artist. Furthermore, it was only the paintings and drawings which were made with the idea of public exhibition in mind: the trolleybuses and raincoat hoard were, on the contrary, private projects, qualifying as Outsider Art even in accordance with LACMA's exclusive definition.\n Art historians have distinguished four categories within van Genk's work:[51]\n This scheme, including non-traditional art objects, is premised on the notion that the artist's life was itself an artwork,[53] a notion current at the time through the legacy of Marcel Duchamp, the work of Joseph Beuys, the rise of performance art, etc. However, the artist's dealer Nico Van Der Endt disapproved of this classification, writing in his Chronicle: \u201cI am not comfortable with the idea of exhibiting the raincoats, which are not art objects.\u201d[54] It is likewise unconventional to classify a library as a work of art, although it is common for art historians to consider an artist's books in order to reconstruct the artist's thought and possible source material.\n Willem van Genk made around 100 paintings, collages, and drawings, most of which feature cityscapes.[51] These works are usually big (\u201cbetween one and two metres wide\u201d) and the product of extensive labor (\u201che tended to work on each one for a couple of years\u201d).[46] There are about 80 paintings/collages, \u201cfive monochrome etchings,\u201d and finally a number of large ballpoint drawings that constitute the artist's late work.[46]\nThrough 1960, the images were relatively traditional, panoramic depictions of European metropolises, with an especial emphasis on transportation: trains and train stations, zeppelins, trolleybuses, etc.[12]  Later in the artist's career he adopted a modernist syntax of fragmentation, often cutting up pictures and recombining them in composite images distinguished by a jumpy, visual staccato. Several \u201cpainted boards or sheets of different sizes, put and held together with small nails and tape\u201d were thus brought together to constitute a single composite work.[55] While this montage technique of composition is by no means unique either to van Genk or artists struggling with debilitating mental illness (Willem de Kooning, for example, did something similar), in his case it is especially suggestive, as this fragmented syntax may be thought to parallel the symptoms of schizophrenia from which the artist suffered.\n The artist incorporated images from other visual media into his collages: advertising copy, waste materials, and cuts of paper from travel brochures and history books. His work has an obsessive, cacophonous character that parallels the overwhelming scale and abrupt juxtapositions of the modern city. Titles and headlines were used as a commentary within the composite image. Composing with the different elements of the modern metropolis, the artist assumed a position of mastery, as if exercising an omnipotent supervision over the city and all its economic, social, and political processes.[56]\n Willem van Genk's fascination with long raincoats may be traced directly to the traumatic experience of his youth, when he was mistreated by the Gestapo, the men of which are recorded to have worn long leather jackets on the occasion.[14] Van Genk incessantly collected long jackets, mostly of cheap plastic, eventually filling his apartment with hundreds.[57] Van Genk seems to have treated these raincoats as fetishes endowed with sexual and defensive power. It seems as though van Genk thought that the Gestapo's power to harm was an emanation of their costumes, and that he sought to protect himself from the dangers of the world by appropriating their outerwear. Raincoats also appear as images in his paintings.\n The collection of raincoats, eventually numbering in the hundreds, is the prime example of van Genk's hoarding fetish. The artist explained, \"I once discarded a raincoat, and looking back, I regret that.\"[58] When Van Gank was arrested and institutionalized and his apartment cleared in 1998, dozens of raincoats were removed.[58]\nAs noted above (see \"Genres\"), the classification of van Genk's hoard of raincoats as works of art is controversial, and was not accepted by his dealer Nico Van Der Endt. Yet the raincoats entered the collection of the Museum De Stadshof in Zwolle at the initiative of Ans Van Berkum, and were interpreted as an integral part of van Genk's oeuvre in her 1998 monograph on the artist.[54] The jackets have subsequently been included in exhibitions on the artist.\n Beginning in the 1980s, van Genk made nearly 70 miniature trolleybuses, constructing these toy-like models \u201cout of plate material and selected waste material.\u201d[46][57] These trolleybuses were the constituent parts of a bigger installation of the Arnheim Bus Station that gradually colonized the living room of van Genk's apartment.\n In an essay on van Genk's library, Patrick Allegaert and Bart Marius repeatedly suggest that it should be considered an integral part of van Genk's artistic oeuvre.[52] Van Genk read widely in at least three languages, with fluency in German and English as well as Dutch.[14] His library housed books on many subjects reflecting his wide-ranging interests: \"general art history, music history, art brut and naive art, Soviet Russian aviation, trains, buses, trams, sexuality, countries and cities, world history...\"[59] Allegaert and Marius note that there were no books on psychiatry in van Genk's library.[59] Although Allegaert and Marius argue for the exceptional import of van Genk's library, claiming that \"it is part of his artistic production,\"[60] they only show how van Genk used his library as source material, an image bank to draw on and transform in his drawings, paintings, and collages: \"And herein lies the importance of his library,\" they write. \"The realism and accurateness of his work were made possible thanks to the visual memory bank to which van Genk had access in his books.\"[61] It is not uncommon, however, for artists to use books as source material. What is uncommon is to consider the source material part of the artistic production.\n Cityscapes predominate as the main subject of van Genk's work, and within the city he was especially drawn to transport sites. For this latter reason he referred to himself as \u201cKing of Stations.\u201d This title, designating a ruler, points to the theme of power, which has assumed a singular importance in the literature on the artist.[62][63] As a consequence of various events in his life, the artist was acutely sensitive to power and powerlessness. While he fancied himself the all-powerful \u201cKing of Stations,\u201d he was really an outsider, disabled and powerless, who felt himself attacked from all sides. Abused as a child by his father and as an adolescent by the Gestapo, subjected to compulsory labor as a young man (an experience he compared to being bullied in a concentration camp), and involuntarily seized on two occasions by the police in old age, Willem van Genk was as much a victim of external forces as he was of his own inner compulsions.\n The 1944 incident with the Gestapo must have been especially terrifying in van Genk's case, since the Nazis were killing mentally disabled people like him starting in October 1939.[64] The Gestapo incident was the origin of van Genk's obsessive raincoat fetish, with the artist appropriating the long jackets worn by the Gestapo in order to project an image of powerfulness and defend himself against enemies, real and imagined. Although this is the clearest case of the abuse of power translated into van Genk's art, this theme permeates his work.\n Van Genk's life and work are both of a piece, with the art created in a desperate attempt to gain some autonomous control over his repeatedly violated life. In his panoramic images of cities, in Nico Van Der Endt's words, van Genk \u201cis like a master architect wielding his power over the entire city.\u201d[12] In other words, these images are megalomaniacal fantasies at odds with the dominated circumstances of the artist's life. By the 1960s, however, the artist had achieved enough freedom to indulge his passion for travel after years of dreaming about foreign cities. van Genk's enthusiasm for travel is clearly reflected in his images of various cities.\n Nico Van Der Endt has suggested that van Genk's art encodes a sexual symbolism, with trains, buses, and zeppelins as phallic symbols of power and the raincoats as condom-like wrappers. \u201cThe image of the locomotive,\u201d he writes, \u201chas an unmistakably sexual import: a powerful, gleaming black monster with fire inside, pumping its pistons and ejaculating hot, white steam.\u201d[46]\nVan Genk, with abundant personal reasons to hate and fear Fascism, initially admired Communism as its putative opposite. In his art there are many depictions of Moscow, which reflect this early sympathy for Soviet Communism. As van Genk's longtime dealer, Nico van der Endt, has related, van Genk \u201csaw Moscow as the capital city of the world\u2019s wretched outcasts. Even so, van Genk, like many others, ultimately lost all his faith in the political left, and in politics altogether. \u2018Every culture discriminates\u2019, he once said.\u201d[65] A painting of Prague from the mid-1970s, by its reference to the socialist reformer Alexander Dub\u010dek, suggests that the violent Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968 was decisive in van Genk\u2019s disavowal of communism. Thereafter the artist most admired the social democracies of Scandinavia.[66] His last trip was to Stockholm, where he suffered his debilitating second stroke in 1997.[67] When Nico Van Der Endt, who became the artist's dealer and closest associate, first encountered the work, he thought it was inimitable, before remembering Kafka's The Trial: \"A tightly packed, teeming, and gloomy cityscape. I could not get over it. I had never seen anything like it before. I could not compare it to anything else. Yes, Kafka. The Trial. That is the first thing that I thought of.\"[68]\n 1984.\n", " 47 Tucanae, 47 Tuc (or NGC 104) is a globular cluster located in the constellation Tucana. It is about 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35\u00a0kpc (13,000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01,100\u00a0ly) away from Earth,[8] and 120 light years across.[9] 47 Tuc can be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 4.1.[3] It appears about 50 arcminutes across. Due to its far southern location, 18\u00b0 from the south celestial pole, it was not catalogued by European astronomers until the 1750s, when the cluster was first identified by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille from South Africa.\n 47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster after Omega Centauri, and telescopically reveals about ten thousand stars, many appearing within a small dense central core. The cluster may contain an intermediate-mass black hole.[10][11]\n The cluster was given its Bayer designation \u03be Tucanae in Johann Bayer's Uranometria (1603). It was recorded as a cluster in 1751-2 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille, who initially thought it was the nucleus of a bright comet.[12] Lacaille then listed it as \"Lac I-1\", the first object listed in his deep-sky catalogue. Its designated number \"47\" was assigned in Allgemeine Beschreibung und Nachweisung der Gestirne nebst Verzeichniss (\"General description and verification of the stars and indexes\"), compiled by Johann Elert Bode and published in Berlin in 1801. Bode did not observe this cluster himself, but had reordered Lacaille's catalogued stars by constellation in order of Right Ascension.\n 47 Tucanae is the second brightest globular cluster in the sky (after Omega Centauri), and is noted for having a small very bright and dense core.  It is one of the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy, containing millions of stars. The cluster appears roughly the size of the full moon in the sky under ideal conditions. Though it appears adjacent to the Small Magellanic Cloud, the latter is some 60.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0kpc (200,000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03,300\u00a0ly) distant,[13] being over fifteen times farther than 47 Tuc.\n The core of 47 Tuc was the subject of a major survey for planets, using the Hubble Space Telescope to look for partial eclipses of stars by their planets.  No planets were found, though ten to fifteen were expected based on the rate of planet discoveries around stars near the Sun.  This indicates that planets are relatively rare in globular clusters.[14] A later ground-based survey in the uncrowded outer regions of the cluster also failed to detect planets when several were expected. This strongly indicates that the low metallicity of the environment, rather than the crowding, is responsible.\n 47 Tucanae contains at least two stellar populations of stars, of different ages or metallicities.[15]  The dense core contains a number of exotic stars of scientific interest, including at least 21 blue stragglers.[16]  Globular clusters efficiently sort stars by mass, with the most massive stars falling to the center.[17]\n 47 Tucanae contains hundreds of X-ray sources, including stars with enhanced chromospheric activity due to their presence in binary star systems, cataclysmic variable stars containing white dwarfs accreting from companion stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries containing neutron stars that are not currently accreting, but can be observed by the X-rays emitted from the hot surface of the neutron star.[18]\n47 Tucanae has 25 known[19] millisecond pulsars, the second largest population of pulsars in any globular cluster.[20]\nThese pulsars are thought to be spun up by the accretion of material from binary companion stars, in a previous X-ray binary phase.  The companion of one pulsar in 47 Tucanae, 47 Tuc W, seems to still be transferring mass towards the neutron star, indicating that this system is completing a transition from being an accreting low-mass X-ray binary to a millisecond pulsar.[21]\nX-ray emission has been individually detected from most millisecond pulsars in 47 Tucanae with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, likely emission from the neutron star surface,[22]\nand gamma-ray emission has been detected with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope from its millisecond pulsar population (making 47 Tucanae the first globular cluster to be detected in gamma-rays).[23]\n It is not yet clear whether 47 Tucanae hosts a central black hole. Hubble Space Telescope data constrain the mass of any possible black hole at the cluster's center to be less than approximately 1,500 solar masses.[8] However, in February, 2017, astronomers announced that a black hole of some 2,200 solar masses may be located in the cluster; the researchers detected the black hole's signature from the motions and distributions of pulsars in the cluster.[10] However, a recent analysis of an updated and more extensive timing data set on these pulsars provides no solid evidence in favor of the existence of a black hole.[11]\n In December 2008, Ragbir Bhathal of the University of Western Sydney claimed the detection of a strong laser-like signal from the direction of 47 Tucanae.[24]\n In May 2015, the first evidence of the process of mass segregation in this globular cluster was announced.[25] The cluster's Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram suggests stars approximately 13 billion years old, which is unusually old.[26]\n", " Fails WP:NBUILD, written promotionally.

Kilbourn Place serves as the headquarters for OX3 Corporation and the offices of Gus G. Widmayer, who is a businessman and real estate developer. The building rests on a plot where the old Groton Hospital was formerly located.  The project was backed by Main Street Bank.\n Dan Quaile of Lincoln Architects designed Kilbourn Place, and Gus G. Widmayer developed it. Although it is in one of Groton's special zoning districts, the renovation was approved because it retained the footprint of the previous building, which had been seen as a blight on the Main Street.  Construction on the building began in 2019.\n Gus G. Widmayer\u2014the son of Francis J. Widmayer, II, a businessman in Acton, Massachusetts and Ayer, Massachusetts\u2014had envisioned renovating the former Donelan's supermarket building at 240 Main Street in Groton since moving there in 2008,[1] but only formulated plans to develop the site in 2018, when it came on the market. At the time, the Donelan's Supermarket occupied the lot.\n Kilbourn Place is located at 240 Main Street in uptown Groton, Massachusetts, on the northeast side of Main between Hollis and School Streets. The building's main entrance is on Main Street.  Above the front door, there is also a clock, which was located by the Delaney Antique Clock Company and is nearly 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) tall.\n The retail building is 12,310 square feet (1,144\u00a0m2), making it the 10th largest building in Groton.

Ron Hubbard, first published in 1952 under the title What To Audit by the Scientific Press of Phoenix.[1] According to the author, it provides \"a coldblooded and factual account of your last sixty trillion years.\" It has gone through many editions since its first publication and is a key text of the Church of Scientology.  The book has been ridiculed by critics of Scientology for its unusual writing style and pseudoscientific claims; it has been described as \"a slim pretense at scientific method ... blended with a strange amalgam of psychotherapy, mysticism and pure science fiction; mainly the latter.\"[2]\n According to Christopher Evans (citing auditor Perry Chapdelaine), the book originated in Scientology auditing sessions held in Wichita, Kansas in early 1952. Chapdelaine said that Hubbard would \"settle himself on a couch with a tape recorder handy and an 'auditor' who would be expected to provide appropriate feedback. In no time a flow of introspection - like the free association characteristic of a psychoanalytic session - would begin.\"[3]\n In a different account, Hubbard's son, L. Ron Hubbard Jr. (otherwise known as \"Nibs,\" or Ronald DeWolf) and Hubbard senior's medical officer, Jim Dincalci, have both stated that the book's content originated when Hubbard fed his son amphetamines:\n [Hubbard] gave his son Nibs some amphetamines, and Nibs started talking, he said, started really going talking fast, from the speed. And he kept talking, he kept talking, and his dad kept giving him speed and all of a sudden he was talking about his history, when he was a clam and all these different situations in early Earth. And out of that came History of Man.[4]\n This material was first released as four lectures which Hubbard delivered to Scientologists on March 10, 1952. Further lectures followed in Phoenix, Arizona in April, and in July 1952 the book What to audit; a list and description of the principal incidents to be found in a human being was published by the Phoenix-based \"Scientific Press\" - an imprint established by Hubbard. The same book was published under the title A History of Man by the London-based Hubbard Association of Scientologists. It was reissued in two substantially modified editions, in 1968 (minus chapter 11 of the original book and under the current title of Scientology: A History of Man), in 1988, and again in 2007, this time with a set of lectures expanding on the content.[5][not in citation given]\n Since 1968, the book's jacket has displayed a picture of a hirsute, unkempt \"caveman\" dressed in a fur, eating the raw meat from a thigh bone of an animal. This appears to refer to one of the past-life incidents described by Hubbard in the book.[citation needed] Many Scientology books have similar curious pictures on their jackets; according to former Scientologist Bent Corydon, their purpose is to restimulate past-life memories and make the book irresistible to purchasers. Corydon states,\n A special \"Book Mission\" was sent out to promote these books, now empowered and made irresistible by the addition of these supposedly overwhelming symbols or images. Organization staff were assured that if they simply held up one of the books, revealing its cover, that any bookstore owner would immediately order crateloads of them. A customs officer, seeing any of the book covers in one's luggage, would immediately pass one on through.[6]\n As the original title suggests, What to Audit / A History of Man was written as a guide for Scientologist auditors, pointing out various Space opera incidents said to occur in all past lives.[citation needed]\n The book proposes that the human body houses two separate entities. The most important is a thetan, said by Hubbard to be the true self of a person, accompanied by a genetic entity, or 'GE': \"a sort of low-grade soul\" located more or less in the centre of the body, and which passes to another body when the current body dies.[2]\n The book describes numerous incidents that, according to Hubbard, occurred to the thetan or the genetic entity in past lives. Although commonly misinterpreted as an alternative theory of evolution, the purpose of the incidents list is that individuals have subconscious memories of past lives as clams, sloths, and cavemen, and that those memories result in neuroses, known as 'engrams'. These stages of biological history, some typified by an animal and others typified by other items, were marked by traumatic incidents which have to be \"run out\" using an E-meter.\n Hubbard emphasized that these incidents are not limited to the list below: for example, he notes \"there are many steps and incidents between the Birds and the Sloth\". The list arbitrarily names some incidents that Hubbard found particularly worth commenting on:\n Hubbard also described numerous incidents of \"implanting\" by hostile alien races, which caused traumatic memories in the thetan. This formed part of an elaborate cosmology of alien civilizations, interstellar dictators, and brainwashing implants - collectively described as \"Space opera\".  In any incident, the thetan might be either protagonist, or victim.\n As Hubbard himself said in the book, A History of Man was written as a technical aid for experienced Scientologists. According to ex-Scientologist Jon Atack, \"The material in the book is hardly encountered in contemporary auditing, but is still required reading for the second secret \"OT\" level of Scientology.\"[2] However, Scientology: A History of Man is part of The Basics Books and Lectures Collection of materials,[9] and as such, is required reading for the current Scientology Class VI Auditor Course.[10] It has apparently been required reading for Level A of the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course (another name for Class VI) at least since 1981, as shown by the course curriculum of that date.[11]\n Christopher Evans notes that the book \"marks a transition point at which the technically oriented Dianetics became the philosophically oriented Scientology.\"[3]\n A History of Man has attracted a good deal of comment from critical reviewers and analysts of Scientology. As Marco Frenschkowski notes, it is a \"very strange book easily ridiculed\".[12] Ex-Scientologist Jon Atack describes it as \"among the most bizarre of Hubbard's works, [which] deserves the cult status that some truly dreadful science fiction movies have achieved\".[2] The Anderson Report of 1965 comments that \"To say it is an astonishing document does not adequately convey the peculiar qualities or contents of \"The History of Man ... For compressed nonsense and fantasy it must surpass anything theretofore written.\"[13] Hubbard's unofficial biographer Russell Miller describes it in similar terms as \"one of Hubbard's most bizarre works and possibly the most absurd book ever written\", which \"invited the derision which was inevitably forthcoming.\"[14] Bent Corydon, a former Scientologist, criticises A History of Man on Scientological grounds, pointing out that Hubbard's \"imaginings, opinions, or observations\" are presented as established facts - in effect, instructing the Scientologist in what he should remember, rather than letting him find out for himself.[15]\n Apart from the unusual style of narration, which Miller describes as having \"wobbled uncertainly between schoolboy fiction and a pseudo-scientific medical paper\",[14] many of Hubbard's claims in A History of Man are incompatible with established scientific knowledge.[citation needed]\n", " \nAn environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer.\n They are part of the environment in which a process runs. For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store temporary files, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the directory structure owned by the user running the process.\n They were introduced in their modern form in 1979 with Version 7 Unix, so are included in all Unix operating system flavors and variants from that point onward including Linux and macOS. From PC\u00a0DOS 2.0 in 1982, all succeeding Microsoft operating systems including Microsoft Windows, and OS/2 also have included them as a feature, although with somewhat different syntax, usage and standard variable names.\n In all Unix and Unix-like systems, each process has its own separate set of environment variables.  By default, when a process is created, it inherits a duplicate environment of its parent process, except for explicit changes made by the parent when it creates the child. At the API level, these changes must be done between running fork and exec. Alternatively, from command shells such as bash, a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via env or using the ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE <command> notation. A running program can access the values of environment variables for configuration purposes.\n Shell scripts and batch files use environment variables to communicate data and preferences to child processes. They can also be used to store temporary values for reference later in a shell script. However, in Unix, other variables are usually used for this.\n In Unix, an environment variable that is changed in a script or compiled program will only affect that process and possibly child processes. The parent process and any unrelated processes will not be affected. Similarly, changing or removing a variable's value inside a DOS batch file will change the variable for the duration of COMMAND.COM's existence.\n In Unix, the environment variables are normally initialized during system startup by the system init scripts, and hence inherited by all other processes in the system. Users can, and often do, augment them in the profile script for the command shell they are using. In Microsoft Windows, each environment variable's default value is stored in the Windows registry or set in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.\n On Unix, a setuid program is given an environment chosen by its caller, but it runs with different authority from its caller. The dynamic linker will usually load code from locations specified by the environment variables $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and $LD_PRELOAD and run it with the process's authority. If a setuid program did this, it would be insecure, because its caller could get it to run arbitrary code and hence misuse its authority. For this reason, libc unsets these environment variables at startup in a setuid process. setuid programs usually unset unknown environment variables and check others or set them to reasonable values.\n The variables can be used both in scripts and on the command line. They are usually referenced by putting special symbols in front of or around the variable name. For instance, to display the user home directory, in most scripting environments, the user has to type:\n In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe, the user has to type this:\n In Windows PowerShell, the user has to type this:\n The commands env, set, and printenv display all environment variables and their values. printenv can also be used to print a single variable by giving that variable name as the sole argument to the command.\n The commands env and set are also used to set environment variables and are often incorporated directly into the shell.\n In Unix, the following commands can also be used, but are often dependent on a certain shell.\n A few simple principles govern how environment variables achieve their effect.\n Environment variables are local to the process in which they were set. If two shell processes are spawned and the value of an environment variable is changed in one, that change will not be seen by the other.\n When a child process is created, it inherits all the environment variables and their values from the parent process. Usually, when a program calls another program, it first creates a child process by forking, then the child adjusts the environment as needed and lastly the child replaces itself with the program to be called. This procedure gives the calling program control over the environment of the called program.\n In Unix and Unix-like systems, the names of environment variables are case-sensitive.\n In Unix shells, variables may be assigned without the export keyword.  Variables defined in this way are displayed by the set command, but are not true environment variables, as they are stored only by the shell and not recognized by the kernel. The printenv command will not display them, and child processes do not inherit them.\n However, if used in front of a program to run, the variables will be added to the program's environment:[1]\n The persistence of an environment variable can be session-wide or system-wide.\n unset is a builtin command implemented by both the Bourne shell family  (sh, ksh, bash, etc.) and the C shell family (csh, tcsh, etc.) of Unix command line shells. It unsets a shell variable, removing it from memory and the shell's exported environment. It is implemented as a shell builtin, because it directly manipulates the internals of the shell.[2][3] Read-only shell variables cannot be unset. If one tries to unset a read-only variable, the unset command will print an error message and return a non-zero exit code.\n In DOS, OS/2 and Windows command-line interpreters such as COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe, the SET command is used to assign environment variables and values using the following arguments:\n The SET command without any arguments displays all environment variables along with their values.\n Examples of environment variables include:\n \n \nUnder DOS, the master environment is provided by the primary command processor, which inherits the pre-environment defined in CONFIG.SYS when first loaded. Its size can be configured through the COMMAND /E:n parameter between 160[5] and 32767[5] bytes. Local environment segments inherited to child processes are typically reduced down to the size of the contents they hold. Some command-line processors (like 4DOS) allow to define a minimum amount of free environment space that will be available when launching secondary shells.[5] While the content of environment variables remains unchanged upon storage, their names (without the \"%\") are always converted to uppercase, with the exception of pre-environment variables defined via the CONFIG.SYS directive SET under DR DOS 6.0 and higher[6] (and only with SWITCHES=/L (for \"allow lowercase names\") under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher).[5][7] In principle, MS-DOS 7.0 and higher also supports lowercase variable names (%windir%), but provides no means for the user to define them. Environment variable names containing lowercase letters are stored in the environment just like normal environment variables, but remain invisible to most DOS software, since they are written to expect uppercase variables only.[5][6] Some command processors limit the maximum length of a variable name to 80 characters.[5] While principally only limited by the size of the environment segment, some DOS and 16-bit Windows programs do not expect the contents of environment variables to exceed 128 characters. DR-DOS COMMAND.COM supports environment variables up to 255, 4DOS even up to 512 characters.[5] Since COMMAND.COM can be configured (via /L:128..1024) to support command lines up to 1024 characters internally under MS-DOS 7.0 and higher, environment variables should be expected to contain at least 1024 characters as well. In some versions of DR-DOS, the environment passed to drivers, which often do not need their environment after installation, can be shrunken or relocated through SETENV or INSTALL[HIGH]/LOADHIGH options /Z (zero environment), /D[:loaddrive] (substitute drive, e.g. B:TSR.COM) and /E (relocate environment above program) in order to minimize the driver's effectively resulting resident memory footprint.[8][7][6][9][10]\n In batch mode, non-existent environment variables are replaced by a zero-length string.\n Standard environment variables or reserved environment variables include:\n The DR-DOS family supports a number of additional standard environment variables including:\n Datalight ROM-DOS supports a number of additional standard environment variables as well including:\n %TZ%, %COMM%, %SOCKETS%, %HTTP_DIR%, %HOSTNAME% and %FTPDIR% are also used by ROM-DOS.[11]\n System path variables[citation needed] refer to locations of critical operating system resources, and as such generally are not user-dependent.\n User management variables[citation needed] store information related to resources and settings owned by various user profiles within the system. As a general rule, these variables do not refer to critical system resources or locations that are necessary for the OS to run.\n Optional System variables[citation needed] are not explicitly specified by default but can be used to modify the default behavior of certain built-in console commands.  These variables also do not need to be explicitly specified as command line arguments.\n The following tables shows typical default values of certain environment variables under English versions of Windows as they can be retrieved under CMD.\n (Some of these variables are also defined when running COMMAND.COM under Windows, but differ in certain important details: Under COMMAND.COM, the names of environment variable are always uppercased. Some, but not all variables contain short 8.3 rather than long file names. While some variables present in the CMD environment are missing, there are also some variables specific to the COMMAND environment.)\n In this list, there is no environment variable that refers to the location of the user's My Documents directory, so there is no standard method for setting a program's home directory to be the My Documents directory.\n Besides true environment variables, which are statically stored in the environment until changed or deleted, a number of pseudo-environment variables exist for batch processing.\n The so-called replacement parameters or replaceable parameters (Microsoft / IBM terminology) aka replacement variables (Digital Research / Novell / Caldera terminology)[14] or batch file parameters (JP Software terminology)[5] %1..%9 and %0 can be used to retrieve the calling parameters of a batchjob, see SHIFT. In batchjobs, they can be retrieved just like environment variables, but are not actually stored in the environment.\n \nSome command-line processors (like DR-DOS COMMAND.COM,[14] Multiuser DOS MDOS.COM/TMP.EXE (Terminal Message Process), JP Software 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT / Take Command and Windows cmd.exe) support a type of pseudo-environment variables named system information variables (Novell / Caldera terminology)[14] or internal variables (JP Software terminology),[5] which can be used to retrieve various possibly dynamic, but read-only information about the running system in batch jobs. The returned values represent the status of the system in the moment these variables are queried; that is, reading them multiple times in a row may return different values even within the same command; querying them has no direct effect on the system. Since they are not stored in the environment, they are not listed by SET and do not exist for external programs to retrieve. If a true environment variable of the same name is defined, it takes precedence over the corresponding variable until the environment variable is deleted again. They are not case-sensitive.\nWhile almost all such variables are prefixed with an underscore (\"_\") by 4DOS etc. by convention (f.e. %_SECOND%),[5] they are not under DR-DOS COMMAND.COM (f.e. %OS_VERSION%).\n In addition, 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, and Take Command also support so called variable functions,[5] including user-definable ones. They work just like internal variables, but can take optional parameters (f.e. %@EVAL[]%) and may even change the system status depending on their function.\n System information variables supported by DR-DOS COMMAND.COM:\n System information variables supported by DR-DOS COMMAND.COM with networking loaded:\n Dynamic environment variables (also named internal variables or system information variables under DOS) are pseudo-environment variables supported by CMD when command-line extensions are enabled, and they expand to various discrete values whenever queried, that is, their values can change when queried multiple times even within the same command. While they can be used in batch jobs and at the prompt, they are not stored in the environment. Consequently, they are neither listed by SET nor do they exist for external programs to read. They are not case-sensitive.\n Indirectly, they are also supported under Windows' COMMAND.COM, which has been modified to internally call CMD.EXE to execute the commands.\n", " \n Lemonia strigata is a moth in the family Brahmaeidae (older classifications placed it in Lemoniidae).[1] It was described by Hans Rebel in 1910.

He was a Whig Party vice presidential nominee in 1836 and is the only person to ever lose a contingent election in the U.S. Senate for Vice President.[2]\n Granger was born in Suffield, Connecticut on December 1, 1792.  Granger was born into a prominent political family, with his father, Gideon Granger, serving in the Connecticut House of Representatives before being appointed by Thomas Jefferson as the longest serving Postmaster General in United States history. His mother was Mindwell (n\u00e9e Pease) Granger (1770\u20131860) and his first cousin, Amos Phelps Granger, also served two terms in the United States House of Representatives.[3]\n Granger pursued classical studies at and graduated from Yale College in 1811.[1] He then moved with his father to Canandaigua, New York in 1814, where he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1816 and commenced practice.[1]\n Granger started his own political career as a member of the New York State Assembly from 1826 to 1828 and from 1830 to 1832.[1] He ran unsuccessful campaigns for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1828, and for Governor of New York in both 1830 and 1832 with the National Republican Party.[2]\n He was then elected as an Anti-Jacksonian to the 24th Congress serving from March 4, 1835 to March 3, 1837.[2]\n In 1836, the Whig Party was unable to settle on one set of candidates for its Presidential ticket. Granger was a regional Vice-Presidential nominee for the northern and border states on the same ticket as William Henry Harrison, though in Massachusetts he was on the Whig ticket headed by Daniel Webster. Though Democrat Martin Van Buren secured enough votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency, Virginia's 23 electors refused to vote for his running mate Richard M. Johnson, who had then lacked only one vote. As a result, votes were split among Johnson, Granger, John Tyler and William Smith with none getting the majority. This triggered a contingent election, the only contingent vice presidential election by the Senate in history, under the Twelfth Amendment with the U.S. Senate deciding between the top two vote-getters Johnson and Granger.[1] As the 25th Congress consisted of 35 Democrats and 17 Whigs, Granger could not hope to be elected and was defeated by Johnson 33-16.\n In the general election of the same year, Granger was also running as a Whig candidate for election to the 25th Congress, but failed in that bid as well.[2] He was re-elected to Congress as a Whig to the 26th and 27th Congresses serving from March 4, 1839 to March 5, 1841.[2]\n In 1841, Granger was appointed Postmaster General in the Cabinet of President William Henry Harrison and served from March 6 to September 18, 1841,[1] the day when almost all Whig Cabinet members left the government of new President John Tyler on the instruction of their party leader Henry Clay. Following that event, he was again elected to the Congress in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Representative John Greig. He served from November 27, 1841 to March 3, 1843 and was not a candidate for reelection in 1842.[1]\n A supporter of the Compromise of 1850, Granger led the pro-Fillmore group which became known as the Silver Gray Whigs after Granger's own silver hair.  This faction would remain in conflict with the anti-Compromise Sewardites until the collapse of the Whig Party in the state in 1855.\n Chairman of the Whig National Executive Committee from 1856 to 1860, Granger joined in the call for the convention of the Constitutional Union Party that was held in May 1860. He was then a member of the peace convention of 1861 held in Washington, D.C. in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending war.\n He married Cornelia Rutsen Van Rensselaer (1798\u20131823), the daughter of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer and Sybella Adeline (n\u00e9e Kane) Van Rensselaer.[3]  She was also the granddaughter of Brigadier General Robert Van Rensselaer,[4][3][5] who was a member of the New York Provincial Congress from 1775 to 1777 and later a member of the New York State Assembly in the 1st, 2nd and 4th New York State Legislatures.[6][a]  The Grangers' home at Canandaigua from 1817 to 1827, now known as the Francis Granger House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[7]  Together, they had a daughter, son, and an unnamed second daughter who died with her mother in childbirth in 1823.[8]\n Granger died in Canandaigua on August 31, 1868.[3]  He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.[2]\n", " The Elbow River is a river in St. Louis County, Minnesota.

He is currently serving as the first bishop of the Diocese of the Carolinas, a diocese of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), as well as rector of St. Andrew's Anglican Church in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.\n Wood was born in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in Wickliffe, Ohio.[1] He received his B.A. from Cleveland State University in 1986 and his M.Div. from Virginia Theological Seminary in 1991, after which he was ordained to the priesthood of the Episcopal Church. Wood served at Episcopal churches in Ohio until being called in 2000 as rector of St. Andrew's, Mount Pleasant, which was then a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina.\n Under Wood's leadership, St. Andrews was described as \"one of the Lowcountry\u2019s biggest church success stories\", growing to a membership of more than 3,000 and planting new churches in Goose Creek, downtown Charleston, and the Park Circle area of North Charleston.[2] In 2006, Wood was one of three finalists in the election for Bishop of South Carolina; ultimately Mark Lawrence was elected.[2] In 2010, St. Andrew's voted by a large margin to leave the Episcopal Church and affiliate with the Anglican Church in North America.[3]\n Shortly after joining ACNA, Wood became involved with efforts to create the Diocese of the Carolinas, which was formed with 14 congregations with an average Sunday attendance of over 2,700. He served as vicar general of the diocese while in formation and, in 2012, he was elected to serve as its first bishop.[4] Wood was consecrated on August 25, 2012, at St. Andrew's by Archbishop Robert Duncan.

In this role, TT continues Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT or TD),[2] which in turn succeeded ephemeris time (ET). TT shares the original purpose for which ET was designed, to be free of the irregularities in the rotation of Earth.\n The unit of TT is the SI second, the definition of which is currently based on the caesium atomic clock,[3] but TT is not itself defined by atomic clocks.  It is a theoretical ideal, and real clocks can only approximate it.\n TT is distinct from the time scale often used as a basis for civil purposes, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  TT indirectly underlies UTC, via International Atomic Time (TAI).  Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, TT is approximately 32.184 s ahead of TAI.\n A definition of a terrestrial time standard was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1976 at its XVI General Assembly, and later named Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT). It was the counterpart to Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), which was a time standard for Solar system ephemerides, to be based on a dynamical time scale. Both of these time standards turned out to be imperfectly defined. Doubts were also expressed about the meaning of 'dynamical' in the name TDT.\n In 1991, in Recommendation IV of the XXI General Assembly, the IAU redefined TDT, also renaming it \"Terrestrial Time\". TT was formally defined in terms of Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), defined by the IAU on the same occasion. TT was defined to be a linear scaling of TCG, such that the unit of TT is the SI second on the geoid (Earth surface at mean sea level). This left the exact ratio between TT time and TCG time as something to be determined by experiment.  Experimental determination of the gravitational potential at the geoid surface is a task in physical geodesy.\n In 2000, the IAU very slightly altered the definition of TT by adopting an exact value for the ratio between TT and TCG time, as 1 \u2212 6.969290134\u00d710\u221210[4] (As measured on the geoid surface, the rate of TCG is very slightly faster than that of TT, see below, Relativistic relationships of TT).\n TT differs from Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) by a constant rate.  Formally it is defined by the equation\n \n\n\n\nT\nT\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nL\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00d7\nT\nC\nG\n\u00a0\n+\n\u00a0\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle TT={\\bigl (}1-L_{g}{\\bigr )}\\times TCG\\ +\\ E}\n\n\n where TT and TCG are linear counts of SI seconds in Terrestrial Time and Geocentric Coordinate Time respectively, \n\n\n\n\nL\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{g}}\n\n is the constant difference in the rates of the two time scales, and \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n is a constant to resolve the epochs (see below). \n\n\n\n\nL\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{g}}\n\n is defined as exactly 6.969290134\u00d710\u221210 (In 1991 when TT was first defined, \n\n\n\n\nL\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{g}}\n\n was to be determined by experiment, and the best available estimate was 6.969291\u00d710\u221210).\n The equation linking TT and TCG is more commonly seen in the form\n \n\n\n\nT\nT\n=\nT\nC\nG\n\u2212\n\nL\n\ng\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\nJ\n\nD\n\nT\nC\nG\n\n\n\u2212\n2443144.5003725\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00d7\n86400\n\n\n{\\displaystyle TT=TCG-L_{g}\\times {\\bigl (}JD_{TCG}-2443144.5003725{\\bigr )}\\times 86400}\n\n\n where \n\n\n\nJ\n\nD\n\nT\nC\nG\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle JD_{TCG}}\n\n is the TCG time expressed as a Julian date (JD). This is just a transformation of the raw count of seconds represented by the variable TCG, so this form of the equation is needlessly complex. The use of a Julian Date specifies the epoch fully. The above equation is often given with the Julian Date 2443144.5 for the epoch, but that is inexact (though inappreciably so, because of the small size of the multiplier \n\n\n\n\nL\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{g}}\n\n). The value 2443144.5003725 is exactly in accord with the definition.\n Time coordinates on the TT and TCG scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of Earth. Specifically, both Julian Dates and the Gregorian calendar are used. For continuity with their predecessor Ephemeris Time (ET), TT and TCG were set to match ET at around Julian Date 2443144.5 (1977-01-01T00Z). More precisely, it was defined that TT instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 exactly and TCG instant 1977-01-01T00:00:32.184 exactly correspond to the International Atomic Time (TAI) instant 1977-01-01T00:00:00.000 exactly. This is also the instant at which TAI introduced corrections for gravitational time dilation.\n TT and TCG expressed as Julian Dates can be related precisely and most simply by the equation\n \n\n\n\nJ\n\nD\n\nT\nT\n\n\n=\n\nE\n\nJ\n\n\nD\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\nJ\n\nD\n\nT\nC\nG\n\n\n\u2212\n\nE\n\nJ\nD\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nL\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle JD_{TT}=E_{J}D+{\\bigl (}JD_{TCG}-E_{JD}{\\bigr )}\\times {\\bigl (}1-L_{g}{\\bigr )}}\n\n\n where \n\n\n\n\nE\n\nJ\nD\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E_{JD}}\n\n is 2443144.5003725 exactly.\n TT is a theoretical ideal, not dependent on a particular realization. For practical purposes, TT must be realized by actual clocks in the Earth system.\n The main realization of TT is supplied by TAI. The TAI service, running since 1958, attempts to match the rate of proper time on the geoid, using an ensemble of atomic clocks spread over the surface and low orbital space of Earth. TAI is canonically defined retrospectively, in monthly bulletins, in relation to the readings that particular groups of atomic clocks showed at the time.  Estimates of TAI are also provided in real time by the institutions that operate the participating clocks.  Because of the historical difference between TAI and ET when TT was introduced, the TAI realization of TT is defined thus:\n \n\n\n\nT\nT\n(\nT\nA\nI\n)\n=\nT\nA\nI\n+\n32.184\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle TT(TAI)=TAI+32.184s}\n\n\n Because TAI is never revised once published, it is possible for errors in it to become known and remain uncorrected.  It is thus possible to produce a better realization of TT based on reanalysis of historical TAI data.  The BIPM has done this approximately annually since 1992.  These realizations of TT are named in the form \"TT(BIPM08)\", with the digits indicating the year of publication.  They are published in the form of table of differences from TT(TAI). The latest as of February\u00a02018[update] is TT(BIPM17).\n The international communities of precision timekeeping, astronomy, and radio broadcasts have considered creating a new precision time scale based on observations of an ensemble of pulsars.  This new pulsar time scale will serve as an independent means of computing TT, and it may eventually be useful to identify defects in TAI.\n Sometimes times described in TT must be handled in situations where TT's detailed theoretical properties are not significant.  Where millisecond accuracy is enough (or more than enough), TT can be summarized in the following ways:\n Observers in different locations, that are in relative motion or at different altitudes, can disagree about the rates of each other's clocks, owing to effects described by the theory of relativity.  As a result, TT (even as a theoretical ideal) does not match the proper time of all observers.\n In relativistic terms, TT is described as the proper time of a clock located on the geoid (essentially mean sea level).[10]\nHowever,[11]\nTT is now actually defined as a coordinate time scale.[12]\nThe redefinition did not quantitatively change TT, but rather made the existing definition more precise.  In effect it defined the geoid (mean sea level) in terms of a particular level of gravitational time dilation relative to a notional observer located at infinitely high altitude.\n The present definition of TT is a linear scaling of Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), which is the proper time of a notional observer who is infinitely far away (so not affected by gravitational time dilation) and at rest relative to Earth. TCG is used so far mainly for theoretical purposes in astronomy. From the point of view of an observer on Earth's surface the second of TCG passes in slightly less than the observer's SI second. The comparison of the observer's clock against TT depends on the observer's altitude: they will match on the geoid, and clocks at higher altitude tick slightly faster.\n", " \n Birds of Tokyo is the third album by Australian alternative rock band Birds of Tokyo, released on 23 July 2010 through EMI Records.

Pekeris, who worked at the IAS at the time von Neumann's IAS machine was being designed. Chaim Weizmann, Israel's future first president, asked Pekeris to establish the Department of Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute, and Pekeris wanted to have a similar computer available there. Pekeris wanted it as means to solve Laplace\u2019s tidal equations for the Earth's oceans, and also for the benefit of the entire scientific community of Israel, including the Defense Ministry.\n In July 1947, an advisory committee for the Applied Mathematics Department discussed the plan to build the computer. Among the committee's members were Albert Einstein, who did not find the idea reasonable, and John von Neumann, who supported it. In one conversation, von Neumann was asked; \"What will that tiny country do with an electric computer?\" He responded, \"Don\u2019t worry about that problem. If nobody else uses the computer, Pekeris will use it full time!\"\n In the end, a decision was made to proceed with the plan. Chaim Weizmann assigned $50,000 for the project\u00a0\u2013 20% of the Weizmann Institute total budget.\n In 1952, Gerald Estrin, a research engineer from the von Neumann project, was chosen to lead the project. He came to Israel along with his wife, Thelma, who was an electrical engineer and also involved in the project. They brought with them schematics, but no parts. Estrin later commented: \"As I look back now, if we had systematically laid out a detailed plan of execution we would probably have aborted the project.\" After arriving, Estrin's impression was that besides Pekeris, other Israeli scientists thought it is ridiculous to build a computer in Israel.\n To recruit skilled staff for the project, a newspaper advertisement was posted. Most of the applicants had no records of prior education because those were lost in the Holocaust or during immigration, but in Israel's budding technical community everyone knew or knew about everybody else. The WEIZAC project also provided an opportunity for mathematicians and engineers to move to Israel without sacrificing their professional careers.[2]\n WEIZAC was an asynchronous computer operating on 40-bit words. Instructions consisted of twenty bits: an eight-bit instruction code and twelve bits for addressing. Punched paper tape was used for I/O, and later, in 1958, magnetic tape. The memory was initially a magnetic drum containing 1,024 words, and was later replaced with a faster 4,096 word memory. In 1961 the memory was further expanded with two additional 4,096 word modules.\n In late 1955, WEIZAC performed its first calculation.[3] Subsequently, it was used to study problems like worldwide changes in tide, earthquakes, atomic spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, random walk methods, numerical analysis and other problems. The computer found out that there was an amphidromic point in the South Atlantic at which the tide does not change. It also numerically calculated the eigenvalues of a two-electron atom quantum system based on programming by Yigal Accad who put Pekeris' development of the relevant equations into machine code. [4] These results were later experimentally verified by the Brookhaven National Laboratory, confirming the correctness of Schr\u00f6dinger's Equations.\n WEIZAC was kept constantly busy, and users (especially from other institutions) became increasingly frustrated with not being able to get computing time, and demanded more computers to become available. WEIZAC's success led to the recognition of the demand for computers and digital technology in Israel, and ultimately, provided the foundation for Israel's computer and technology industries.[2]\n On December 5, 2006, WEIZAC was recognized by the IEEE as a milestone in the history of electrical engineering and computing, and the team who built it was awarded the \"WEIZAC Medal\".[5]\n", " Anivsky District (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0301\u043d) is an administrative district (raion) of Sakhalin Oblast, Russia; one of the seventeen in the oblast.[1] Municipally, it is incorporated as Anivsky Urban Okrug.[4] It is located in the south of the oblast.

He married Deirdre Brownlow in 1943.\n After the outbreak of the Second World War, Coleman escaped from France to the United Kingdom.\nHe enlisted in the Royal Navy in October 1940 as a stoker.\nHe took part in the Dieppe raid in 1942, and joined the Helford Flotilla until April 1943 when he was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant, RNVR.\n He then joined SOE with a codename \"Victor\". After several unsuccessful attempts, he was parachuted into France on 15 September 1943 and joined the Acolyte network around Lyons. He ran the circuit after Robert Lyon had been arrested in May 1944, until his escape and return in June. He returned to England on 15 September 1944.\n In 1945-1946, he was British Naval Liaison Officer in Calais.\n He was awarded the MBE, the M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance and the Croix de Guerre avec Palmes.\n Vera Atkins wrote this obituary[1] following Jean Coleman's death\u00a0: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} The first thing to say about Jean is that he had in full measure that all too rare quality, charm. This is what secured for him, within hours of meeting her, the delightful Deirdre Brownlow, daughter of General Brownlow. They met at a dinner at Claridge's, became engaged before dawn and were married by Special Licence the following day. It was a marriage stormy at times but never dull, which produced three lovely daughters and during the years of his sad decline Deirdre supported, nursed and protected him from the outside world. Only his utter devotion to \"Darling\" (his name for her) can perhaps explain the source from which she drew her strength. After several unsuccessful attempts, Jean was dropped on 15 September 1943 to a circuit organised by Robert Lyon based on the town of the same name with a branch in the Roanne area to which Jean was attached. For over a year he was in charge of parachute and sabotage operations of which the following are mentioned in his Citation for the Croix de Guerre avec Palme: \"Attack on the bridge at R\u00e9gny on the Roanne/Lyon line, derailment of troop train between Roanne and Saint-Germain-des-Foss\u00e9s, attack on train between Roanne and Saint-\u00c9tienne and destruction of the Pont de Changy. He took part in a number of guerilla actions, notably dispersing a German convoy near M\u00e9rigny on 22 August 1944. The Citation praises not only his courage but also his tact which gained for him the friendship as well as the admiration of his French comrades\". Unfortunately, towards the end of Jean's life, business worries and disappointments led to a nervous breakdown but until the end he managed to retain much of his courage, humour and undeniable charm.", " \n Metius subsericeus is a species of ground beetle in the subfamily Pterostichinae.[1] It was described by Straneo in 1952.[1]\n \n", " \n The dollar was the currency of Sarawak from 1858 to 1953. It was subdivided into 100 cents. The dollar remained at par with the Straits dollar and its successor the Malayan dollar, the currency of Malaya and Singapore, from its introduction until both currencies were replaced by the Malaya and British Borneo dollar in 1953.\n During the Japanese occupation period (1942\u20131945), paper money was issued in denominations ranging from 1 cent to 1,000 dollars. This currency was fixed at 1 dollar = 1 Japanese yen, compared to a 1:2 pre-war rate. Following the war, the Japanese occupation currency was declared worthless and the previous issues of the Sarawakian dollar regained their value relative to sterling (two shillings four pence).\n All Sarawak coins carry the portrait and the name of either of the three \"White Rajahs\" of Sarawak, James Brooke until 1868, Charles Brooke from 1868 to 1917, and Charles Vyner Brooke from 1917 to the end of this currency in 1938.[citation needed] Throughout its history, coins were minted in values of \u200b1\u20444 cent, \u200b1\u20442 cent, 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, and 50 cents. The copper \u200b1\u20444 was the smallest denomination and the first to be discontinued, last being issued in 1896. The \u200b1\u20442 was also always copper and after reductions in size was eventually discontinued in 1933. Starting in 1892 1 cent coins had a hole in the centre, but the holed design was later discontinued after 1897.[citation needed]\n In 1920 the 1 cent was struck in copper-nickel but later reverted to bronze in 1927. The 5 and 10 cents were 80% silver until 1920, when they were briefly reduced to 40% silver and then replaced by copper-nickel the same year. The 20 and 50 cents remained silver but were reduced from 80% to 40% starting that same year thereafter.[1]\n The first series was issued by the Sarawak Government Treasury. They were hand-stamped notes of low quality.  All later notes were issued by the Government of Sarawak except for the 10-cent and 25-cent notes in 1919 (by the Treasury again).

Its activities cover a period roughly from 400 C.E., the fall of the Roman Empire, to 1700 C.E. ACMRS organizes programs at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona State University in Tempe, and the University of Arizona in Tucson. ACMRS is a tri-university research unit within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Clas) at Arizona State University (ASU).  ACMRS was established in 1981 by the Arizona Board of Regents for the purpose of promoting and coordinating all aspects of Medieval and Renaissance Studies at all three state universities through the support of research, lectures, symposia, conferences, visiting professorships, and publications.  It cooperates with the Medieval and Renaissance Committees (MARC) of Northern Arizona University (NAU) and the University of Arizona (UA) to promote similar scholarly activity at ASU's sister universities.\n From 1982 until 1994, ACMRS was directed by Jean R. Brink from the Department of English at ASU. It is currently directed by Robert E. Bjork, also from the Department of English at ASU.\n In establishing ACMRS, ASU employed Professor Fredi Chiappelli,[1]  then Director of the UCLA Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, as a consultant. Because he directed an internationally recognized center and had previously served as a visiting professor at the University of Arizona and as a visiting lecturer at Northern Arizona University and was therefore familiar with the Arizona universities, his participation in the founding of the Center was viewed as essential. The founding document approved by the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) in 1981 indicated the following provisions: ACMRS was to be located at ASU; a Director with an indefinite term was to be appointed; a steering committee composed of three scholars from each university, and other such detailed specifications.[2]\n During the next stage in ACMRS history, continued lack of funding made it more and more difficult to maintain a statewide network. Communication by telephone and electronic mail continued to flourish, and some cooperation among faculty continued independently of a formal structure as well as through ACMRS. Local campus operations at the three universities, however, began to perform many of the functions originally envisioned for a statewide Center. Because of a statewide budgetary crisis, ACMRS was asked in the spring of 1993 to cut $50,000 from its budget. In response to that request some operating reductions were made, and some activities discontinued completely. The Center in this period had two full-time staff and several graduate student assistants besides the Director. The main activities included a lecture series, hosting the national conferences of the Sixteenth-Century Studies Society[3] and the Renaissance Society of America, and a Distinguished Visiting Professor program.[2]\n In July 1994, Robert E. Bjork[4] was appointed Director of ACMRS. Since his appointment, in addition to continuing programs already established such as an ad hoc lecture series, a graduate student travel award to the Medieval Congress at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, and a book award for promising undergraduates intending to do post-graduate work in medieval or Renaissance studies, Bjork instituted over twenty programs or initiatives that changed the structure of ACMRS, lent it more national and international prominence, and reinvigorated cooperation among Arizona's three universities. Chief among these new programs was the inauguration of the annual interdisciplinary conference in 1995 and the institution of MRTS (Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies[5]) at ACMRS in 1996, a prestigious publication initiated at Binghamton University. As a result of all the programmatic changes instituted during this period, the ACMRS staff grew to five full-time staff personnel. By 1999, ACMRS had several well-established publishing programs besides MRTS, and a much stronger local, national, and international presence than it had in the past.[2]\n ACMRS\u2019s local, regional, national, and international standing continued to rise during this period; new programs and initiatives were put into place; and external and internal funding continued to grow. Grant writing both externally and internally, for example, increased to an average of sixteen proposals per year; and manuscript submissions to the Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies[5] (MRTS) series continued to flow in.   In the spring of 1999, Bjork inaugurated the lecture series \u201cDistinguished Lectures in Medieval and Renaissance Studies\u201d[6] and over the course of that year entered into new joint publication ventures in the U.S. and abroad, established new book series, and continually increased cooperation between ASU, UA and NAU. Outreach programs likewise remained strong and internationally included joint meetings of the ACMRS conference with that of the Medieval Academy of America in 2001 that attracted 367 attendees from 12 countries and with that of the Renaissance Society of America in spring 2002 that attracted approximately 730 attendees worldwide.  Since the acquisition of MRTS in 1996, ACMRS saved ASU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences an average of $7,224 per year in its salary commitment to ACMRS for the series and, because of that commitment, generated an average of $20,000 per year in grant support and $15,500 in additional salaries.[7]\n In 2002-3, ACMRS began to distribute the publications of the Viking Society for Northern Research at the University of London, the Istituto storico italiano per il Medio Evo in Rome, and Roma nel Rinascimento also in Rome; it also successfully negotiated with AMS Press[8] for the publication of the annual journal Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History.[9] The biannual meeting of the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists,[10] for which Director Bjork was president, came to Arizona then. In 2003-4, the ACMRS director negotiated agreements with the Medieval Studies Program at Pennsylvania State University and with the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists to publish series of their books and with Brepols to have another book series Late Medieval and Early Modern Studies produced under ACMRS\u2019s auspices and the auspices of the University of Melbourne.[11] These agreements were designed to embed ACMRS in the world community of medieval and Renaissance scholars and to foster international cooperation. And to gauge how successful ACMRS was becoming in funding its own programs, the Director conducted an informal survey of all medieval and Renaissance studies centers in North America, inquiring about what percentage of their annual budgets they managed to cover from their own funds and what percentage was covered by their universities.  He discovered that as of March, 2003, ACMRS ranks first in this category, its closest competitor being the Medieval Institute at Western Michigan University,[12] which hosts the largest medieval conference in the world every year and covers approximately 50% of its own budget. Beginning in 2007, ACMRS negotiated an agreement with the University of Maryland, College Park, to co-publish the journal Early Modern Women;[13] it began a new subseries within MRTS called FRETS, French of England Texts and Studies[14] with Fordham University and York University; and it became the joint sponsor with the Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship of MEDFEM-L (medieval feminist listserv).[15] Last, the director served on the inaugural standing committee of CARMEN, Co-operative for the Advancement of Research through a Medieval European Network, a European organization whose main purpose is to generate ideas and institutional teams for major funding proposals to agencies in Europe such as the European Science Foundation.[16] At the second meeting of CARMEN, held this time in Prato, Italy, Bjork also began negotiations for collaborative efforts between ACMRS and the developing Prato Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies of Monash University in Australia.[7][17]\n The Cambridge Summer Study Abroad Program, established by ACMRS in 1996, is a five-week program that offers students interdisciplinary study opportunities in the history and culture of medieval and Renaissance Britain. During the five-week program, students live in residence at St. Catharine's College, University of Cambridge. Courses are taught by faculty from Cambridge, Arizona universities and universities outside Arizona and include weekly excursions.[18]\n The Medieval and Renaissance Studies Certificate Program was established by ACMRS for students interested in pursuing their studies at ASU. This program is open to both graduate and undergraduate students.[19]\n This introduction to Latin Paleography internet course was developed by Professor Bernard Muir of the University of Melbourne and is offered by the ACMRS. This course in codicology and paleography offers training in the transcription of thirty-six western European book hands representing the period AD 200-1500.[20]\n In the spring of 1999, ACMRS established its Distinguished Lecture Series in Medieval and Renaissance Studies.[6] Each semester, the Center brings one eminent scholar to ASU for a few days to present a public lecture, interact with upper-division and/or graduate classes, and meet informally with students and faculty. Often, ACMRS is also able to arrange speaking engagements for the distinguished visitor at the University of Arizona in Tucson and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.\n ACMRS sponsors free public lectures by both visiting and local scholars.[21][22]\n ACMRS Annual Fall Symposia explore topics of interest to the general public.[23] In past years they have dealt with subjects such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robin Hood, Don Quixote, love and sex in medieval and Renaissance Italy, Arthurian legends, Jews, witch hunts, music and dance, and death and dying in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\n ACMRS hosts weekly reading groups in a variety of ancient languages such as Classical Latin, Medieval Latin, Old English, and Old Norse.[24] These reading groups are free and open to the public; a venue for anyone to learn or practice in a small group environment.\n The National Endowment for the Humanities sponsored \u201cDisease in the Middle Ages\u201d, a five-week seminar for college and university teachers held July 5 - August 8, 2009 in London, England.[25]\n Iter is a gateway to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance that includes a massive, retrospective, on-line medieval and Renaissance bibliography covering all languages and disciplines.[26] Iter is partnered with the Renaissance Society of America, the Sixteenth Century Society and Conference, and the University of Toronto.\n ACMRS participated in a project to make a sixteenth-century manuscript available to the public.[27] The Geese Book is a large, lavishly illuminated, two-volume gradual made for the church of St. Lorenz in Nuremberg between 1504 and 1510. Today it is conserved in the J. Pierpont Morgan Library in New York (M. 905). And this multisensory work can now be explored through online multimedia technologies: complete digital\nfacsimile, sound recordings, high resolution images of the illuminations and video commentary.[28] A team of experts headed by Volker Schier and Corine Schleif opened the Geese Book to scholars and broader audiences.[29] Additionally an interactive DVD-ROM with sound recordings, explanatory material, documents, and essays will be prepared. Other facets of the project include a seminar, a concert, a radio documentary, and an audio compact disc.\n ACMRS occasionally hosts the annual meetings of the Medieval Academy of America and the Medieval Association of the Pacific.[33] The first occurred in 2001 and the second in 2011.\n Discipuli Juncti: Students Connected through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance is a conference, instituted by the ACMRS in 2007, gives undergraduate students who are interested in Medieval and/or Renaissance culture another opportunity to present their research or project to a group of their peers and others.[34]\n In 2003, ACMRS hosted the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists' Conference entitled Conversion and Colonization.[10]\n ACMRS hosts the CARA Data Project, or Committee on Centers and Regional Associations, the Medieval Academy of America's online directory.[35]\n ACMRS houses the Lopez Collection, the books and papers of Robert S. Lopez, Sterling Professor of History and founder of the Medieval Studies Program at Yale University.[36]\n MEDFEM-L is an un-moderated forum for discussion of feminist approaches to medieval studies.

Many of these features allow users to engage the poem dynamically through the integrated components of this site.\n Mediaevistik is an international journal of interdisciplinary medieval research, edited by Peter Dinzelbacher and Albrecht Classen.\n ASU Faculty may apply for a fellowship to receive a two-course teaching reduction during one semester.[38] An ACMRS Visiting Distinguished Professor will bear the load of those two courses.[39]\n ACMRS offeres a travel award to a graduate student to present a paper at the International Medieval Congress, held every May at the Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo.[40]\n The ACMRS Undergraduate Book Award, in honor of founding director, Jean Brink, is given to an undergraduate student who has excelled academically in the study of the Middle Ages and/or Renaissance and who expects to continue study in one of these areas at the graduate level.\n Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies (MRTS) is a series of translations, studies, reference works, and editions including those of the Renaissance English Text Society (RETS). MRTS Online is a joint project between Iter and ACMRS to make select MRTS titles available in electronic format.\n Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (ASMAR) is edited by Robert Bjork and is published by Brepols Publishers, Belgium This series presents collections of essays in medieval and Renaissance Studies that are also the focus of the annual ACMRS Conference. The series will also include occasional volumes, generally on themes related to those of the annual conferences.\n ACMRS Occasional Publications is a new series that will include works that are not necessarily scholarly in nature but have relevance to the teaching and study of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, such as memoirs, collections of personal essays, and historical fiction.\n The Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies formed an imprint subsidiary to publish historical fiction centered in the medieval and Renaissance periods. Founded in 2011, Bagwyn Books is dedicated to publishing well-researched historical fiction novels that are appropriate for an audience ranging from young adult (ages 14+) to an adult audience.\n Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile (ASMMF) is a project which makes available in microfiche nearly five hundred manuscripts containing Old English.[43]\n In the spring of 1999, Oxford University Press appointed ACMRS Director Bjork as General Editor of The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages (ODMA), a new reference tool constructed on the general model of The Oxford Classical Dictionary,[44] for all key aspects of European history, society, religion, and culture, c. 500 to c. 1500, including relevant aspects of the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic dynasties, and Asiatic peoples such as the Avars and the Mongols are included.[45] ODMA was published in June 2010[46] and featured in many medieval blogs and news stories.[47][48]\n Late Medieval and Early Modern Studies is jointly directed by ACMRS and the University of Melbourne and published by Brepols, this book series covers the historical period in Western and Central Europe from ca. 1300 to ca. 1650. It concentrates on topics of broad cultural, religious, intellectual and literary history.[11]\n Discipuli Juncti Undergraduate Conference Papers are a collection of the best papers presented at the Annual ACMRS Undergraduate Conference.[49]\n Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History is a journal that provides an outlet for the presentation of scholarship that often falls outside the limitations of other publications. It publishes interpretive and historiographical essays that explore the ramifications of current scholarship or that treat issues and themes of interest to any historian of the pre-modern period.[50]\n Early Modern Women: An Interdisciplinary Journal is a joint publication of ACMRS and the University of Maryland. This journal publishes essays on women and gender during the years 1500-1700 from all geographical areas and across all relevant fields: European, African, Islamic, Asian, and colonial studies, as well as studies of literature, art, music, history, history of science, religion, and anthropology.[51]\n ACMRS has assisted in publishing issues of Moreana, a bilingual - French and English - journal published three times a year.[52] Moreana provides an international forum for research and exchange about the world of Thomas More.[53]\n In October 2010, ACMRS unveiled the Heritage Edition of the St. John's Bible[54] at its annual Distinguished Lecture in Medieval Studies. Dr. Rodney M. Thompson, Honorary Research Fellow at the School of History and Classics of the University of Tasmania, presented a lecture on the \"Great Illuminated Bibles of 12th-Century England: A Study in Splendor\" following the dedication of the specially-printed facsimile Bible.[55] The seven-volume Heritage Edition was donated by Phoenix resident, George Berkner, a 1956 Saint John's University graduate. It resides at the Universities' Special Collections in Hayden Library at ASU and in the offices of ACMRS.\n In the Spring of 2004, ACMRS received a unique medieval statue as a donation from the Metropolitan Museum of Art docent, Jeri Garbaccio and her husband Charles. The gift was accepted in honor of Florence E. Nelson of Scottsdale, Arizona and in memory of Renee Kra, former Managing Editor of Radiocarbon at the University of Arizona. The medieval figure is a three-foot wood polychromy seated king of Spanish origin, dating back to the second half of the thirteenth century.

Bibbs in 1999.  The sculpture is installed above the entrance to the J. F. Miller Center, at the corner of West Michigan Street in Indianapolis, Indiana. Glory is made from fabricated steel and bronze. Angels and trumpets are the two distinct images visible within the sculpture. The sculpture is very large, with dimensions of 80\u00a0ft x 40\u00a0ft x 1\u00a0ft. Gibbs signed his name to the sculpture and included a copyright sign.\n The sculpture was commissioned by Joseph F. Miller, founder of the J. F. Miller Center.  The dedication date is listed as March 1999. The Center on West Michigan Street used to house the Second Baptist Church, one of the city\u2019s oldest African-American Baptist churches, until it moved in 2002.  The building was renovated to house offices, as the Miller Center, which commissioned the sculpture.[1]\n Bibbs drew inspiration from the Bible\u2019s book of Ezekiel, from African-American heritage and from an African-American medical clinic located nearby.[2]\n Garry R. Bibbs is an Associate Professor, Head of Sculpture and Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Kentucky. He received a Ford Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellowship, which allowed him to study with internationally renowned sculptor Richard Hunt, at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois. He was recipient of a 1996 Southern Arts Federation, National Endowment for the Arts Visual Arts Fellowship for Outstanding Printmaker in the Southern States. His exhibition history includes showings at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., the Raus in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Hertz Gallery in Louisville, Kentucky, the Art Institute of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois, and the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. His works are in the collections of the High Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, Illinois, ATT Corporation\u2013York City, Brown-Forman Corporation, Commonwealth Insurance, the Brown-Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the Robert Derden Collection, the Richard Hunt Collection, the Louisville City Fire Department and the Living Arts and Science Center in Lexington, Kentucky.

It was Charnock whom the Jacobites deputed to go see King James and ask for 10,000 French troops. This was refused as the troops were needed by the French on account of tensions with William III in the Low Countries. Barclay escaped, but Charnock was arrested, tried and found guilty, and hanged on 18 March 1696.[1]\n The Tower of London Armoury in the White Tower has a blunderbuss labelled as belonging to Robert Charnock with which he intended to shoot King William III.\n", " Coordinates: 45\u00b013\u2032N 36\u00b043\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff45.217\u00b0N 36.717\u00b0E\ufeff / 45.217; 36.717\n Taman (Russian: \u0422\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c) is a rural locality (a stanitsa) in Temryuksky District of Krasnodar Krai, Russia, located on the coast of the Taman Bay.

From the end of the 15th century until 1783, this was a site of a Turkish fortress. Before the annexation it was a sanjak subordinate to the elayet of Kaffa.\n The modern stanitsa was founded by the Zaporozhian Cossacks under Anton Golovaty on August\u00a025, 1792 as the latter's residence and the first garrison of the Black Sea Cossack Host. Until 1849, Taman was officially considered to be a town, even though it had no local government of its own and was governed from the nearby stanitsa of Akhtanizovskaya. In 1849, Taman was re-organized as a stanitsa and established local government of its own.\n In August 2008, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a government resolution authorizing the development of a major international cargo port several kilometers south of Taman. Currently, a fertilizer terminal is under construction there to link with the ammonia pipeline to Odessa owned by TogliattiAzot.\n On August 2013 Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said that the Port of Taman will open in 2019 to handle dry cargoes, such as grain and coal. He also added that federal spending will amount to $2.3 billion, while private investors are expected to contribute the remaining 152 billion rubles.[3]\n In 2012, the first tonne of cargo was planned to be send from the port in September 2016.[4]\n Principal sights of Taman include:\n \n", " Takamaka is one of the 22 administrative regions of Mah\u00e9, Republic of Seychelles.

It is east of the River Cherwell, the Oxford Canal and the Cherwell Valley Line railway.\n Grimsbury was first settled in the 6th century as a Saxon hamlet.[1] and for centuries was a village separate from Banbury. The placename is a corruption of the Saxon name for a defended enclosure (burh) of a person called Grim. It is possible that the name was derived from a pseudonym for the pagan god Woden.[2][3]\n Grimsbury currently includes the town's Royal Mail sorting offices, which were built over the former Banbury Merton Street railway station, Banbury railway station, Banbury United F.C.'s ground, and the Victoria Place apartment development.\n Local living conditions had improved greatly during the Victorian era with the removal of several poorly built cottages that were deemed to be only \"hovels\" and an end to the endemic \"dwarfism\" and rickets that had plagued the local children in the early 19th century. A slightly later development still further east in Grimsbury was of larger houses. A lot of cottages what was called 'Waterloo' (today's Waterloo Road), which apparently lay just east of Banbury Bridge to the north of the road, had transformed from the early 19th century so that by 1841 Waterloo was considered one of the better off parts of Grimsbury. Due to Banbury's then boom time Grimsbury's principle expansion occurred between 1852 and 1881, when some 500 houses were built, around Middleton road, Causeway, Merton Street, Duke Street, and North Street.[4]\n When meadows and a by the recently discussed race-course at Grimsbury were sold to the Great Western Railway circa 1850, the owner also sold the other part of his land, north of the Middleton road to the Banbury Freehold Land Society, which was financially backed by Cobb's Bank, to build middle-class type houses on, but development was slow at the time and some plots were never built upon.[4] The land in question and the location of today's Spice Ball Park are marked as \"Liable to flooding\" on the 1882, 1900, 1910 and 1922 Ordnance Survey maps.\n Duke Street, was located at the western edge of Wilkins' (now demolished) brick pit, was developed around 1870.[2][3] There was a substantial 'brick, tile and drain works' with a short tramway in it to the east of Grimsbury in the versinaty of Howard Street according to the 1882, 1883 1900, 1910, 1922 1923 and 1947 Ordnance Survey maps. It had closed by 1923[2][3] and the last workshops had shut in 1955. It was mostly built on by 1965 according to the 1955 and 1965 O.S. maps.\n The Banbury Town Council built the houses in King's Road and on the Easington estate at the time and other working-class type houses were built at the south end of Britannia Road and the area to the east between 1881 and 1930, and also in both Old Grimsbury Road and Gibbs Road in Grimsbury, and more up-market houses were built in both the Marlborough Road area and in Bath Road, Kings Road, Park Road, and Queen Street in Neithrop.[5][6] The mostly late 19th-century suburb of Grimsbury witnessed rapid growth between 1881 and 1930. About 300 more houses were built after 1945, in the areas of Grimsbury Square, Fergusson Road, Howard Street, School View, and Edward Street.  To the north of Grimsbury Square is the 1945\u201355 area of \"New Grimsbury\" and south of it is the 1930 and earlier old town of \"Old Grimsbury\".[5][6]\n Grimsbury, Old and New, were historically hamlets in Warkworth parish, Northamptonshire, but which were transferred in 1889 to the parish of Bodicote, Oxfordshire.[7]\n A retail and residential development was built on the former site of the Bridge Motors Vauxhall dealership and garage and opened in 2010.\n The region has in recent decades been home to many Asian families and in recent years has been settled by many Eastern Europe immigrants.\n Grimsbury is on a floodplain and suffered severe floods in 1998 and 2007.\n Workmen found a fizzing and burning incendiary chemical that was suspected to be left over from a long-demolished First World War munitions factory and ammunition testing range.  Thames Valley Police closed the Tesco Express, The Pepper Pot pub and the Atlantis Fish bar and set up a 100-metre cordon on 19 April 2012.[1][2]\n Three World War I phosphorus grenades on 20 April [3] [4] and an unreleased number of anti-tank grenades were destroyed on the 24th [5]. The area around the Tesco Express Middleton Road, Grimsbury, witnessed the disposal of several lost pieces of World War I ordnance that remained buried after the closure of the local ammunition testing range. They were reckoned to be part of a batch of 20 that were lost in 1919. [6] [7] [8]. On the 26th some World War II smoke bombs were also disposed of. Fire station manager Mick Clarke said fire crews and the Royal Logistics Corps were disposing of them [9] [10].\n The post-1945 housing estate is situated at the northern end of the first (old) Grimsbury estate. About 300 more houses were built after 1945, in the areas of Grimsbury Square, Fergusson Road, Howard Street, School View, and Edward Street. To the north of Grimsbury Square is the 1945\u201355 area referred to as New Grimsbury. South of it is the old town of \"Old Grimsbury\" built prior to 1930.[5][6] It was expanded in both the late 1950s and early 1960s with a mixture of working-class and middle-class homes. Further minor expansions were also taking place towards the north of the estate in 2008\u20132011.\n Grimsbury was expanded further as the Market Quarter housing development has begun on the former cattle market site, along with the new Axis housing estate just to the east, which has added over 300 new homes and a primary school to replace Dashwood School.\n Grimsbury was once home to Western Europe's largest cattle market, on Merton Street in Grimsbury. The market was a key feature of Victorian life both in the town and countryside. In the late 1920s the economy of Banbury was revolutionised by the arrival of new industries and in particular by the relocation of the out of town livestock market to Grimsbury it used to be held in Neithrop and/or Bridge Street, Banbury.  The new site selected due to its proximity to the railway station.[2][3] It was formally closed in June 1998, after being abandoned several years earlier and was replaced with a new housing development and Dashwood Banbury Academy, a primary school.[1]\n Banbury Rural District had built another water works on the present site in the 1890s as the need for formal sewerage treatment as well as water purification grew as the town expanded ever outward as illustrated in the 1882, 1900, 1910 and 1922 Ordnance Survey maps. It would be expanded after World War II and modernised thereafter. Banbury Rural District built a reservoir near today's Hennef Way road circa the late 1960s.\n The 1960s industrial estates are home to both many local and national firms such as Prodrive, a Cherwell District Council depot and the town's sewerage works. It was later expanded in the mid to late 1990s and in the district council announced plans to expand it slightly eastward, but nothing has ever come of it since.\n Grimsbury Wesleyan Chapel in West Street was a neoclassical brick and stone building completed in 1871.[9] The present Methodist church in West Street is modern.\n The Church of England parish church of Saint Leonard was designed by the local architect Walter Mills and built in 1890.[9] It is a Gothic Revival building with north and south aisles joined to the nave by four-bay arcades.[9]\n St. Leonard's was a chapel of ease to Christ Church in Broad Street until 1921, when Grimsbury was constituted as a separate parish with Saint Leonard's as its church. In 1931 a fire destroyed much of the south side of St Leonard's and thereafter the church was redecorated and a new vestry built.\n In 1978 a new Church of England Parish of Banbury, comprising four districts, was inaugurated. In 1998 the Banbury Team Ministry was dissolved and St. Leonard's reinstated as a separate parish.\n In 2001 a new dais was built in the nave of St. Leonard's and the High Altar was placed in the centre. The font was also moved from the south aisle and placed in the nave at the west end of the church.\n In 2003 the church was redecorated with the central pillars being painted to reflect the decoration of the ceiling which is believed[by whom?] to have been designed in the style of a canal narrowboat.[citation needed]\n There are two primary schools in Grimsbury.\n Dashwood Banbury Academy moved from Dashwood Road on the other side of the river to brand-new buildings in Merton Street in 2008. The school is part of a Federation with the town's main secondary school, Wykham Park Academy, formerly Banbury School. It has 200 pupils. It is unusual for an Oxfordshire primary school in having a school uniform which was introduced in 2009. The headteacher is Vicki McLean.\n St. Leonard's Church of England Primary School[10] was originally Christchurch School. Its original buildings were designed by the Oxford Diocesan architect G.E. Street and built in 1860-61.[9]\n The town centre's Bankside park is near the railway bridge, on the opposite canal to Grimsbury.\n The Howard Road play area is in Grimsbury.\n The Verney Road play area, Chaldons Road play area and urban park and Alma Road village green are all in the Market Quarter estate .\n There is also 1 other park and 1 minor play ground on the seat.\n There are three local public houses: The Bell Inn and The Elephant and Castle are both next to the Londis shop and the bridge into Banbury town centre.

Pica means a craving to eat substances that has no nutrition like dirt or chalk.[2] Literally translated, picabot is a robot that likes to eat rubbish.\n picabot eVo2, based on QQ2L by Metapo Inc, was launched in July 2008. It operated on rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery, comes with a docking station(home base), power adaptor, remote control and a spare filter. The robot would return for recharge automatically whenever it finished its job, the battery level is low or anytime commanded to return with a remote control.[3]\n Since Metapo first launched the US version of the robot called Infinuvo QQ1 in the US market sometime in 2003, it has undergone several upgrades including 3 major ones.[4] Compare to QQ1, the QQ2L has improved much on its Artificial Intelligence(AI), battery run time and product reliability.\n picaBot eVo2 has further improved on the floor disinfecting, the suspension system and battery pack of the robot compare to the US version of QQ2L. The result is better germicidal effect when it added photocatalysis[5] to the UV tube mounted on the bottom of the robot. The improved suspension system allow the robot to traverse different type and height of floors with greater ease. Higher spec battery increase the robot's running time significantly.\n In early 2009, the issue of short run time has been resolved with the new battery supplier. The latest picaBot eVo2M which was launched in early February 2010 with a 2800mAH battery pack has received favorable feedback from users with many claiming run time of more than 100 minutes. Besides upgrading done in Malaysia, Corvan also introduced a 100% run-in program since 2008 where every robot is run a full cycle with all functions working. The objective of the upgrade and 100% run-in program is to improve the reliability of the robot.[6]\n", " Northern Norway Regional Health Authority (Norwegian: Helse Nord) is one of four regional health authorities in Norway.

She is a descendant on her father's side of Flora McDonald. Her father, a planter, amassed a fortune in the East India trade. He died just before the American Civil War, and his family were stripped of the large fortune left them through the mismanagement of a relative and by the war. The mother took her three young daughters to Providence, Rhode Island, to educate them. Selinger was a precocious child, showing aptitude for anything in the line of music, art and language. She finished the high-school course in Providence, studied with private tutors, and ended with a course in the Cooper Institute School of Design in New York City. With art, she studied medicine, but decided not to attempt to practice in that field.[3][1]\n At the age of nineteen, she taught in southern schools, acting as instructor in painting, drawing, elocution, botany, French and Latin for seven years in various institutions. While teaching in Louisville, Kentucky, she read a paper on \"Art Education\" before a gathering of five-hundred teachers, which resulted in the establishment of a normal art-school in that city, of which she was principal. Ill-health compelled her to go north, and she returned to Providence, where she opened a studio.[3]\n In Providence, on October 9, 1882,[1]  she married Jean Paul Selinger (1850\u20131909), the artist.

V. Wills. Its purpose was to prepare students for examinations set by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, founded in 1841. Westminster College flourished in the late Nineteenth Century but faced growing competition from public institutions in the 1920s and 1930s, and it closed its doors in around 1942. [1]\n The Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy was a private college founded in October 1874 by the chemist and pharmacist George S. V. Wills. Its purpose was to prepare students for examinations set by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, founded in 1841. \n By 1877, three years after its foundation, Westminster College was able to make the claim that it was the largest school of its kind in London. In addition, its students had achieved almost as many examination passes as all the other schools in England combined.[1]\n In 1882, as his student body expanded, Wills moved Westminster College into new premises, a defunct Baptist chapel in Trinity Street, Southwark. [1]\n In 1908, Wills suffered a financial setback following the failure of his pharmacy business, resulting in the loss of Wills's house and his personal assets. This financial failure caused the voluntary liquidation of Westminster College, despite it being registered as a limited company in 1901. However, the College was moved to a new location in Clapham, where it resumed its activities[1]\n In 1899 Wills self-published a memoir titled The Works of George S. V. Wills and The Westminster College of Chemistry and Pharmacy.\n In December 1916 Westminster College moved again, from 402 to 190 Clapham Road. [1]\n During the 1920s and 1930s growing competition from public institutions began to put pressure on private schools such as Westminster College, and their number began to decline. Westminster College was one of the last survivors, and it continued to advertise its courses into the 1930s. Its founder, George S V Wills, died on 28 April 1932, aged 84. In 1939, at the outbreak of war, the threat of air attacks led the College to discontinue day classes in favour of correspondence courses. The College address at 190 Clapham Road ceased to exist in 1942, most likely the year of its closure. [1]\n", " Elmer E.

But theirs is a troubled relationship, and he has a competitor. Parnaoz\u2019s sister Popina has a son, Popeye, whose father flees at news of the pregnancy. As Popeye grows, he too falls in the love with Ino. The rivalry between Parnaoz and his nephew Popeye is intense, and Parnaoz eventually leaves Colchis for Crete.\n Part III, Parnaoz, is the story of Parnaoz\u2019s return to Colchis after about 10 years in Crete. But Ino has not yet married, and the rivalry between Parnaoz and Popeye continues. Parnaoz marries childhood friend, Tina, but he \u201cdidn\u2019t care whom he married\u201d for he was \u201clooking for a refuge.. somewhere to hide from Ino.\u201d Tina and Parnaoz soon have a son, little Ukheiro, but Parnaoz now wants to leave his wife. \u201cParnaoz knew only one thing: whether he got together with Ino or not, he could never accept not being with her, or any substitute life offered, or anything from life.\u201d Interwoven in this section is also the tale of Icarus and Daedalus. In Greek mythology, father and son attempt to flee Crete with waxed and feathered wings. Icarus does not heed his father\u2019s warning, and flies too close to the sun. The heat melts the waxed wings, and he falls into the sea and drowns. What follows Parnaoz\u2019s disillusionment with his wife, and his constant pining for Ino, is the tragedy that comes from not heeding any warning, and from idealistic and obsessive love.\n Ae\u00ebtes -  he was a King of Colchis in Greek mythology, son of the sun-god Helios and the Oceanid Perseis (a daughter of Oceanus), brother of Circe and Pasipha\u00eb, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. The name means \"eagle\" (aietos).[2] His consorts were Idyia and either Asterodia the Oceanid, Neaera the Nereid. According to others, he was brother of Perses, a king of Tauris, husband of his niece Hecate, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. Yet other versions make Ae\u00ebtes a native of Corinth and son of Ephyra, or else of a certain Antiope.\n Medea - is a sorceress who was the daughter of King Ae\u00ebtes of Colchis,[3] niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios, and later wife to the hero Jason, with whom she had two children, Mermeros and Pheres. In Euripides's play Medea, Jason leaves Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers him his daughter, Glauce.[4] The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children.\n Absyrtus - was in Greek mythology the son of Ae\u00ebtes and a brother of Medea and Chalciope. His mother is variously given: Hyginus calls her Ipsia,[5] Hesiod and the Bibliotheca call her Idyia,[6] Apollonius calls her Asterodeia,[7] and others Neaera or Eurylyte.[8] \nWhen Medea fled with Jason, she took her brother Absyrtus with her, and when she was nearly overtaken by her father, she murdered her brother, cut his body into pieces and strewed them on the road, so that her father might thus be delayed by gathering the limbs of his child. Tomi, the place where this occurred, was believed to have derived its name from temno (\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03c9, \"cut\").[9]\n Jason - he was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was famous for his role as the leader of the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea.  Because he belongs to mythology, he may have existed before the Greek Dark Ages (1100\u2013800 BC.) The people who wrote about Jason lived around 300 BC.\n Jason appeared in various literary works in the classical world of Greece and Rome, including the epic poem Argonautica and the tragedy Medea. In the modern world, Jason has emerged as a character in various adaptations of his myths, such as the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts and the 2000 miniseries of the same name. Jason is also the main character in the British television series Atlantis.\n Minos - he was the first King of Crete, son of Zeus and Europa. Every nine years, he made King Aegeus pick seven young boys and seven young girls to be sent to Daedalus' creation, the labyrinth, to be eaten by the Minotaur. After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in the underworld. The Minoan civilization of Crete has been named after him by the archaeologist Arthur Evans. By his wife, Pasipha\u00eb (or some say Crete), he fathered Ariadne, Androgeus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Glaucus, Catreus, Acacallis and Xenodice. By a nymph, Pareia, he had four sons, Eurymedon, Nephalion, Chryses and Philolaus, who were killed by Heracles in revenge for the murder of the latter's two companions; and by Dexithea, one of the Telchines, he had a son called Euxanthius.[10] By Androgeneia of Phaestus he had Asterion, who commanded the Cretan contingent in the war between Dionysus and the Indians.[11] Also given as his children are Euryale, possibly the mother of Orion with Poseidon,[12] and Pholegander, eponym of the island Pholegandros.[13]\n Icarus -  In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English;  Ancient Greek: \u1f3c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u00cdkaros, Etruscan: Vikare[14]) is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus's father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, whereupon the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Pha\u00ebthon.\n Daedalus - he was a skillful craftsman and artist.[15][16] He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx although this is unclear.\n Chiladze wrote A Man Was Going Down the Road in the early 1970s while Georgia was still a part of the Soviet Union. The book is allegorical. In the story of how Colchis was overrun by outsiders - and native Colchians like Popeye were turned into informants and torturers - Chiladze is telling Georgia's story.[17]\n", " Sonia Lafuente Mart\u00ednez (born 7 December 1991) is a Spanish figure skater. She is a six-time Spanish national champion. Lafuente became the first Spanish skater to medal on the ISU Junior Grand Prix circuit when she won silver at the 2006 Mexico Cup.[1]\n Lafuente was born on 7 December 1991 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands.[2] She is a university student, studying sports. She intends to spread her studies over several years in order to accommodate her career.[3]\n Lafuente began skating at age four, after her parents took her and her sister to a newly opened rink in Madrid. Carolina Sanz and Ivan Saez were her coaches for much of her career.[3] In the 2003\u201304 season, Lafuente made her international debut as a novice, and finished with the bronze medal at the Merano Cup, an event she would win one year later. She began competing in junior internationals in 2005-06.\n In the 2006\u201307 season, Lafuente became the first Spanish skater to win a Junior Grand Prix medal. She trained mainly in Majadahonda.[4]\n In 2008, Lafuente made her debut at the European Championships. She was 30th at her first Senior Worlds. The next season, she finished 23rd at Europeans and 26th at Worlds, which did not qualify her for the 2010 Winter Olympics. However, she was able to qualify for the Olympics with an 8th-place finish at the 2009 Nebelhorn Trophy, and finished 22nd in Vancouver. The next season, she received her first Grand Prix assignments, and finished 10th and 7th, respectively, at the 2010 Skate Canada International and the 2010 Trophee Eric Bompard. She was 12th at the European Championships but did not qualify for the free skate at Worlds.\n Lafuente was 9th at the 2011 Nebelhorn Trophy, 7th at the 2011 Trophee Eric Bompard, 5th at the 2011 Golden Spin of Zagreb, and 15th at the 2012 European Championships in Sheffield.\n Lafuente finished 7th at the 2013 European Championships and earned the minimum score to compete at the 2013 World Championships where she was 22nd.\n The 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy was the last opportunity to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Lafuente was unable to win one of the six available ladies' berths, finishing 26th. In October 2013, she decided to move to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to train in Brian Orser's group.[5][6] In 2014, she began working with Ghisland Briand and Tracy Wilson as her coaches.[7]\n After finishing 33rd at the 2016 European Championships, Lafuente decided to leave competition for a year.\n GP: Grand Prix; CS: Challenger Series; JGP: Junior Grand Prix\n  Media related to Sonia Lafuente at Wikimedia Commons\n", " Ronald Joel Flores (born August 9, 1979) is a former left-handed relief pitcher who played with the Oakland Athletics from 2005 to 2007.\n The Oakland Athletics selected Flores in the 29th round (870th overall pick) of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft.  He is the younger brother of Randy Flores, current director of scouting for the St. Louis Cardinals and also a former MLB left-handed relief specialist.[1]  Both men graduated from El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera, California, and attended the University of Southern California (USC), playing college baseball for the Trojans.  Ron Flores attended from 1998 to 2001, and was a member of USC's 1998 national championship baseball team.  He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from USC.\n In limited appearances with Oakland, Flores was mostly the second or third lefty in the bullpen. He pitched a career-high four shutout innings for his first big league win on June 29, 2006 against the San Diego Padres. His first Major League save came after he pitched a scoreless 10th inning in the final game of the 2006 season. On December 12, 2007, Flores signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, uniting him with his older brother, Randy Flores. He became a free agent at the end of the season and signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds, only to be released by the organization on April 1, 2009.\n After being released by the Reds, Flores signed with the independent Long Island Ducks. He pitched in 53 games for them before retiring.\n", " Ballads of Sacco & Vanzetti is a set of ballad songs, written and performed by Woody Guthrie, related to the trial, conviction and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti.

Guthrie never completed the project and was unsatisfied by the result.[1] The project was released later in its abandoned form by Asch.\n An unreleased track, \"Sacco's Letters to His Son\" was recorded by Pete Seeger for the project.\n", " Dream of a Rarebit Fiend is a 1906 American silent film directed by Edwin S. Porter for Edison Manufacturing Company.[1] It is a seven-minute live-action film adaptation of the comic strip Dream of the Rarebit Fiend by American cartoonist Winsor McCay. The film was marketed as using several special effects in which \"some of the photographic 'stunts' have never been seen or attempted before.\"[2]\n In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[3]\n The Rarebit Fiend gorges on Welsh rarebit at a restaurant. When he leaves, he begins to get dizzy as he starts to hallucinate. He desperately tries to hang onto a lamppost as the world spins all around him. A man helps him get home. He falls into bed and begins having more hallucinatory dreams. During a dream sequence, the furniture begins moving around the room. Imps emerge from a floating Welsh rarebit container and begin poking his head as he sleeps. His bed then begins dancing and spinning wildly around the room before flying out the window with the Fiend in it. The bed floats across the city as the Fiend floats up and off the bed. He hangs off the back and eventually gets caught on a weathervane atop a steeple. His bedclothes tear and he falls from the sky, crashing through his bedroom ceiling. The Fiend awakens from the dream after falling out of his bed.\n The Fiend was played by John P. \"Jack\" Brawn.\n The Edison Military Band performed a piece called \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" on an Edison cylinder (Edison 9585) in 1907,[4] written by Thomas W.

The museum opened to the public on November 28, 1995. Previous directors were Daniel Giralt-Miracle (1988\u20131994), Miguel Molins (1995\u20131998), Manuel J. Borja-Villel (1998\u20132007), and Bartomeu Mar\u00ed (2008-2015), while the current director, since 2015 is Ferran Barenblit.\n In 1959, art critic Alexandre Cirici Pellicer formed a group of contemporary artists showing work in a series of 23 exhibitions with the hopes of beginning a collection for a new contemporary art museum in Barcelona. It was not until 1986 that the Barcelona City Council recommended the American architect Richard Meier & Partners (1987\u20131995) to design the museum. Art critics Francesc Miralles and Rosa Queralt were hired to write the museum\u2019s mission statement. In 1987, the MACBA Foundation was created. In the following year the MACBA Foundation, in conjunction with the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Barcelona City Council, founded the MACBA Consortium in order further the process of the museum. The Consortium commissioned Meier later that year to build the museum.[1] This was a controversial issue considering that the museum had no collection at the time of construction. The museum opened to the public in 1995,[2] well after the 1992 Summer Olympics for which it was planned.[3]\n In 2014, the museum acquired an additional venue for its programming, comprising a converted 15th-century chapel and two large halls, a total of about 21,500 square feet, as well as the central Pla\u00e7a dels Angels square. While MACBA has long used the chapel for performances and site-specific installations, this time the city lent the entire historic cluster to the institution for an unspecified term.[4]\n Meier embraced the difficult task of creating a building that would ultimately display a variety of contemporary artworks that were unknown to him at the time of design. The choice to build the museum in the Pla\u00e7a dels \u00c1ngels is consistent with Meier\u2019s vision to situate the building amongst some of Barcelona\u2019s oldest streets and buildings, in addition to revamping the public space of the Raval.[5]\n After the completion of the $35 million construction, local media referred to the museum as \u201cthe pearl\u201d amongst the old architecture and narrow streets just a few blocks from Gothic center of Barcelona.[6] The building\u2019s architectural style has strong references to Modernism. The large (120 by 35 meters) white building has much of its southern elevation glazed, providing the visitor with views across the plaza, and allowing for an abundance of natural light to illuminate the interior galleries. The museum has three main galleries, which can be subdivided, as well as five smaller galleries, one of which is in a tower.[7]\n The permanent collection of around 5,000 works[8] (up from 1,100 works at the time of the museum's opening in 1995)[9] dates from the mid-20th century onward. There are three periods of modern art represented: the first one covers the forties to the sixties; the second spans the sixties and seventies; the third period is contemporary. The collections focus on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art, although some International artists are also represented.[citation needed]\n In 2011, Philippe M\u00e9aille loans 800 works of the radical conceptualists artists group Art & Language at MACBA.[10][11] Fearing political instability after the Catalonia referendum in October 2017, he will withdraw his loan and repatriate his collection to Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau-Museum of contemporary art.[12][13]\n In December 2007, the museum opened its Study Center, and the Library Reading Room and Special Collections Room grant the public free access to the museum\u2019s books, publications collection, and archives.\n The museum publishes mainly exhibition catalogues from the museum, although has published some monographic books and critical essays. It also has three digital publications: \"Quaderns port\u00e0tils,\" \"Quaderns d'\u00c0udio,\" and \"S\u00e8rie Capella MACBA.\"\n The museum offers lectures, seminars, guided tours, video screenings and more to broaden the educational opportunities available to the public.\n The Museum address is Pla\u00e7a dels Angels, 1, Barcelona. The closest metro stations are Catalunya and Universitat.\n Opposite the main museum, in the medieval Convent dels \u00c0ngels for which the square is named, a chapel has been converted into a separate exposition area known as the Capella del MACBA, with regular video art performances. Entrance to this part of the museum is free.\n Another contemporary art museum, Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona (CCCB), is adjacent to MACBA, and accessible both from the street and from the inner patio.\n The area in front of the museum is known among skateboarders to be one of the most iconic \"spots\" for the sport in the world.[14][15][16] A 3D model of the location is featured in the smartphone game \"Skater\",[17] and was a featured location in Transworld Skateboarding magazine for Go Skateboading Day in 2016.[18]\n MACBA is managed by a consortium founded in 1988 whose members include the regional government of Catalonia, Barcelona City Council, and the Spanish Ministry of Culture.[19] In March 2015, Bartomeu Mar\u00ed i Ribas resigned as director of the museum in light of a censorship row over a controversial installation by the Austrian artist Ines Doujak.

It is an allegory referencing Fundamentalist self-perception during the Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy.[1] The song is in the form of AABA and has a 12 bar count. It is based on Jeremiah 12:9, \"Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.\"  It was recorded in 1936 by Roy Acuff. It was also later recorded by Johnny Cash and Kitty Wells (both in 1959), Pearly Brown (1961), Hank Locklin (1962), Marty Robbins (1966), Lucinda Williams (1978), Bert Southwood (1990), Marion Williams, and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n The tune is the same apparently traditional melody used in the song \"Thrills That I Can't Forget,\" recorded by Welby Toomey and Edgar Boaz for Gennett in 1925, and the song \"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes,\" originally recorded by the Carter Family for Victor in 1929. The same melody was later used in the 1952 country hit \"The Wild Side of Life,\" sung by Hank Thompson, and the even more successful \"answer song\" performed by Kitty Wells called \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" in the same year. A notable instrumental version is found on the Grammy Award-Nominated album 20th Century Gospel by Nokie Edwards and The Light Crust Doughboys on Greenhaw Records.[2]\n The connection between these songs is noted in the David Allan Coe song \"If That Ain't Country\" that ends with the lyrics \"I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes/  Concerning a great speckled bird/ I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels/ and went back to the wild side of life.\"\n The song is also referenced, and portions of the melody-line are used, in \"When the Silver Eagle Meets the Great Speckled Bird\" by Porter Wagoner. \n \"Something to Love\", by Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit references the song when speaking of learning music: \"They taught me how to make the chords and sing the words. I'm still singing like that great speckled bird.\"\n Both the song \"The Great Speckled Bird\" and the passage from Jeremiah may be a poetic description of mobbing behavior.[3]\n", " \n The Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein were titles of the Frankish Empire. The dynastic family came from the County of Schauenburg near Rinteln (district Schaumburg) on the Weser in Germany. Together with its ancestral possessions in B\u00fcckeburg and Stadthagen, the House of Schauenburg ruled the County of Schauenburg and the County of Holstein. The comital titles of Holstein were subject to the liege lord, the Dukes of undivided Saxony till 1296, and thereafter the Dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg.\n The County of Schaumburg originated as a medieval county, which was founded at the beginning of the 12th century. It was named after Schauenburg Castle, near Rinteln on the Weser, where the owners started calling themselves Lords (from 1295 Counts) of Schauenburg. Adolf I probably became the first Lord of Schauenburg in 1106. In 1110, Adolf I, Lord of Schauenburg was appointed by Lothair, Duke of Saxony to hold Holstein and Stormarn, including Hamburg, as fiefs.[1]\n In a battle with Denmark, however, Adolf III became prisoner of the king Valdemar II, to whom he had to give Holstein in exchange for his freedom. In 1227 Adolf III's son, Adolf IV, recovered the lost lands from Denmark. Subsequently, the House of Schaumburg were also counts of Holstein and its partitions Holstein-Itzehoe, Holstein-Kiel, Holstein-Pinneberg (till 1640), Holstein-Pl\u00f6n, Holstein-Segeberg] and Holstein-Rendsburg (till 1460) and through the latter at times also the dukes of Schleswig.\n After 1261 the previously jointly ruling brothers Gerhard I and the elder John I divided the Counties of Holstein and Schauenburg (Schaumburg). Gerhard I received the Counties of Holstein-Itzehoe and Schaumburg, whereas John received the County of Holstein-Kiel. After the death of John I, his sons Adolphus V and John II reigned jointly in Holstein-Kiel. In 1273 they partitioned Holstein-Kiel and John II continued ruling over Kiel; Adolphus V the Pomeranian then received Segeberg (aka County of Stormarn). After the death of Adolphus V, Holstein-Segeberg was reincorporated into Holstein-Kiel.\n After Gerhard I's death in 1290 his three younger sons partitioned Holstein-Itzehoe and Schaumburg into three branches, with Adolph VI the Elder, the third brother, getting Holstein-Pinneberg and Schaumburg south of the Elbe, the second brother Gerhard II the Blind getting Holstein-Pl\u00f6n, and the fourth Henry I receiving Holstein-Rendsburg. The eldest brother John was Canon at the Hamburg Cathedral.\n After the death of Gerhard II his sons Gerhard IV and his younger half-brother John III the Mild inherited and ruled in Holstein-Pl\u00f6n together. In 1316 the brothers militarily seized the possessions of John II the One-Eyed (d. 1321) in Holstein-Kiel, whose sons had been killed. John III the Mild, before a second-born co-ruling count in Pl\u00f6n, then received Kiel from the deposed John II the One-Eyed, a cousin of his father Gerhard II the Blind. Gerhard IV continued ruling Holstein-Pl\u00f6n as sole count.\n After the death of John III's nephew Gerhard V, Count of Holstein-Pl\u00f6n in 1350, who had succeeded Gerhard IV, the Pl\u00f6n line became extinct and John III re-inherited their possessions. In 1390 his son Adolphus IX (aka VII)[2] ruling since 1359 Kiel including Pl\u00f6n, died without issue and thus Nicholas (Claus) of Holstein-Rendsburg and his nephews Albert II and Gerhard VI (jointly ruling till 1397) succeeded to the territories of Holstein-Kiel and Holstein-Pl\u00f6n.\n In 1390 the Holstein-Rendsburg line had assembled the larger part of the partitioned Holstein counties, to wit Kiel, Pl\u00f6n and Segeberg, but not Holstein-Pinneberg, which existed until 1640. Members of the Rendsburg family branch were often also simply titled as Counts of Holstein after 1390. For the Pinneberg family branch, usually residing in the County of Schaumburg, the titling after Schaumburg started to prevail.\n In 1397 after the death of their uncle Nicholas (Claus), with whom the nephews Albert II and the elder Gerhard VI had jointly ruled Holstein-Rendsburg, they partitioned Holstein-Segeberg (aka county of Stormarn) from Holstein-Rendsburg, with Albert receiving the new branch county in return for waiving his co-rule in Rendsburg. After Albert's death in 1403 Segeberg reverted to Rendsberg. In 1459, with the death of Adolphus XI (aka VIII),[2] the Rendsburg branch was extinct in the male line and the nobility of Holstein-Rendburg and of Schleswig then assigned the succession to his sister's son King Christian I of Denmark, House of Oldenburg.\n After King Christian I of Denmark, House of Oldenburg had been chosen as heir to the County of Holstein-Rendsburg Christian ascended to the comital throne in 1460. In 1474 Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, elevated Christian I from Count of Holstein-Rendsburg to Duke of Holstein. For his succession in the Duchy of Holstein see List of rulers of Schleswig-Holstein#House of Oldenburg (1460\u20131544). The Schauenburg line in the Counties of Holstein-Pinneberg and Schaumburg persisted until its extinction in the male line in 1640. This line is also known as Holstein-Schauenburg. The Counts were elevated to Princes of Schaumburg in 1619/1620, however, the Dukes of Holstein opposed the transition of that title to the County of Holstein-Pinneberg.\n After the death in 1640 of Count Otto V without children, the rule of the House of Schaumburg ended in Holstein. The County of Holstein-Pinneberg was merged under Christian IV with his royal share in the Duchy of Holstein, which is now part of the state of Schleswig-Holstein. For Christian IV and his successors see List of rulers of Schleswig-Holstein#House of Oldenburg (1640\u20131713)\n The Principality of Schaumburg proper, however, was partitioned among the agnatic Schauenburg heirs into three parts, one incorporated into the Principality of L\u00fcneburg of the Duchy of Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg, the second becoming the County of Schaumburg-Lippe and the third continuing the name County of Schaumburg, ruled in personal union by Hesse-Cassel. All the three are now part of the state of Lower Saxony. The Sovereign Lordship of Gemen, in 1531 acquired for Schaumburg through marriage by Jobst I, and ruled by his second-born son of Jobst II (ca. 1520\u20131581, regnant since 1531), passed on to the family of Limburg Stirum. Gemen is in today's North Rhine-Westphalia.\n (Note: Here the numbering of the counts is the same for all counties, as all were titled Counts of Holstein, despite of the different parts of land or particular numbering of the rulers. The dukes are numbered by the year of their succession.)\n", " Fintonia is a village and seat of the chiefdom of Tambakha in Bombali District in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone.\n \n", " The Vice President of the Confederate States of America was the office held by Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, who served under President Jefferson Davis of Mississippi from February 18, 1861, until the dissolution of the Confederacy on May 5, 1865. Having first been elected by the Provisional Confederate States Congress, both were considered provisional office-holders until they won the presidential election of November 6, 1861 without opposition and inaugurated on February 22, 1862.[1]\n According to the Confederate States Constitution, the Vice President's office was almost entirely identical to that of the Vice President of the United States.[2]\n The Vice President was elected by an electoral college (closely modeled after the U.S. Electoral College) along with the President. Electors had to cast one of their votes for someone not from their State. If no candidate won a majority in the Electoral College, the Confederate Senate would elect the Vice President from the top two vote-getters. Like the President, the Vice President had to be a natural-born citizen of the Confederacy or a natural-born citizen of the U.S. born prior to December 20, 1860, and a resident in the Confederacy for over 14 years.\n The major difference between the U.S. and the C.S. Vice Presidencies was that the Confederate term in office was six years long. The President was explicitly forbidden from running for a second term by the constitution, but the Vice President was not. It was unclear whether or not a Vice President, who became President in the middle of a term, could run for his own term afterward.\n The Vice President's primary duty was presiding over the Confederate Senate and breaking tied votes, as the U.S. Vice President presides and breaks ties in the U.S. Senate. He was also the first person in the line of succession. If the President died, resigned or was removed from office, the Vice President would become the new president for the remainder of his term. This never happened.\n During his tenure in office, Vice President Alexander Stephens grew increasingly distant from President Davis and spent less and less time in Richmond, the Confederate capital. He eventually spent much of his time trying, without success, to maintain diplomatic channels with the USA and pushed for a negotiated end to the war. He was sent by Davis to represent the Confederate government at the Hampton Roads peace conference.[3]\n", " David Hartsuch was the Iowa State Senator from the 41st District.

It debuted on iTunes on June 6, 2011 and was later released on CD on August 23, 2011.\n The original concept for the album was envisioned by singer/guitarist Billy McCarthy while touring with his previous band, Pela.  The title was the first idea he had.[1]  McCarthy's experiences with his mother and brother, both of whom where diagnosed schizophrenic, influenced nearly all of the writing for the album.  McCarthy, Sanderson and the other two members had recorded most of the original album, but decided to scrap about 80 percent of it \"because it just wasn't strong.\"[2]  Fights with their manager and record label along with disagreements within the band ultimately lead to the break up of Pela before the album could be finished.  During that time, McCarthy's brother James committed suicide, further increasing the issues within the band.\n McCarthy and Sanderson stayed in contact and eventually recorded a new song, \u201cBook of James\u201d, with producer David Newfeld.[2]  The duo decided they wanted to finish the entire album.  McCarthy and Sanderson worked on the tracks in Sanderson's home studio.[3]  Once they finished, they released the album independently through iTunes and UNFD.[4]\n They announced their existence as a band by performing \u201cBook of James\u201d, \u201cChapel Song\u201d and other songs at the Cutting Room Studio with John Richards of KEXP.[5]\n \"Chapel Song\" was featured on Starbucks' free 10-song Summer Mix sampler for 2011[6] and in a commercial for REI.[7]\n A music video for \"Chapel Song\"[8] was produced/directed by Matthew C.

TNT and his side-kick Dan the Dyna-Mite were created by Mort Weisinger for DC Comics, and made their debut in Star-Spangled Comics #7 (April 1942)\n The \"human hand grenades\" had a short lived career during the Golden Age of Comic Books, reappearing occasionally in reprint form during the seventies, returning in Super Friends # 12, and appearing from time to time in All-Star Squadron and its Post-Crisis sequel, Young All-Stars.\n TNT and Dan The Dyna-Mite are the secret identities of chemistry teacher and track coach Thomas N. \"Tex\" Thomas and his student Daniel Dunbar.  While working together with some \"radioactive salts\", they discover they are charged with atomic energy.  Thomas is charged with positive energy, while Dunbar is charged with negative energy. Thomas makes a pair of rings which keeps the energy dormant until they are touched together, at which point the pair gains enhanced strength, speed, and resistance to injury, and the ability to generate different forms of energy.  Thomas generates heat, while Dan can generate short bursts of electricity. The series ran through Star-Spangled Comics #23 (August 1943).\n TNT was revived as part of Roy Thomas's All-Star Squadron, and its spin-off, The Young All-Stars. After TNT and Dyna-Mite had been active for a few months, they are summoned by the All-Star Squadron to participate in their first general meeting.  Their participation seems to have been limited to attending meetings and little else until April 1942, when Liberty Belle, as chairperson of the All-Stars, asks TNT and Dyna-Mite to look into Axis espionage activity in Colorado.  Here, they meet future All-Star member Iron Munro, but TNT is killed by Gudra the Valkyrie, a supernatural agent of Adolf Hitler.[1]  TNT is posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, leaving Dyna-Mite to work with Munro and other members of the Young All-Stars.  Keeping Thomas' ring, Dan finds he can activate his powers by slamming both rings together.\n In 2010's DCU: Legacies #2, TNT and Dyna-Mite are revealed to have been founding members of the Seven Soldiers of Victory.[2][3][4] How this retcon affects their histories, such as the previously established death of TNT and Dyna-Mite's Young All-Stars stint, has not yet been revealed.\n The latest version of the character is featured in Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers project. Calling himself Dyno-Mite Dan, Harris D. Ledbetter makes an online purchase of what he believes are TNT and Dan The Dyna-Mite's rings, and joins five other heroes in Seven Soldiers # 0. Sadly, he is killed with the rest of his team. His rings are actually working fakes made by Cassandra Craft.\n After being charged with atomic energy and making contact with Dan the Dyna-Mite, TNT has enhanced strength, speed and resistance to injury. He also has heat generation. \n Despite some confusion, TNT does not appear in the 1993 four issue mini-series The Golden Age, written by James Robinson and drawn by Paul Smith. This series is set during the period of McCarthyism and, much as he did in The Young All-Stars, TNT is said to have died during World War II. The similarly named Tex Thompson (formerly Mr. America and the Americommando) has retired from superheroics and gone into politics. Thompson's former superhero allies eventually discover that his brain has been replaced with that of the Ultra-Humanite, and he has transplanted the brain of Adolf Hitler into the now-superstrong body of Dan the Dyna-Mite.\n", " Vincent J.

The village has a population of 2013 people.[2] The main landmark is Catholic Church of All Saints built in 1787. Opposite the church stands (since World War II defunct) synagogue, later turned community center then car repair and nowadays a bar.\nThe village stretches about 4\u00a0km along river Bojnianka which continues through villages of Ve\u013ek\u00e9 Dvorany, Urmince and Chrabrany before emptying into the Nitra river, itself a tributary of the Danube.\n The name is derived from boj (fight, battle) preserved in all Slavic languages. Bojna or Bojnica meant place of battle, battleground (modern Slovak: bojisko) but the name could be derived also from some personal name related to boj, e.g. Bojan, Bojen.[3] In this case, Bojn\u00e1 is shortening of Bojnja Ves - village of Bojen.[4] Similar names in Slovakia are Bojnice, Bojni\u010dky, Bojanov\u00e1, Bojarky and many others.\n Bojn\u00e1 is known for an archeological complex which belongs to one of largest Great Moravian agglomeration in Slovakia. The system of Slavic hill forts lies on the southeast foot of Pova\u017esk\u00fd Inovec on the strategic point between V\u00e1h and Nitra river basins. The pass near Bojn\u00e1 was guarded by hill forts Bojn\u00e1 I (Valy), Bojn\u00e1 II (Hradisko), Bojn\u00e1 III (\u017dih\u013eavn\u00edk) and the location Bojn\u00e1 IV (Nov\u00e9 Valy). The locality is close to other pre-Great Moravian and Great Moravian sites like Pobedim, Ducov\u00e9 or Nitrianska Blatnica.\n The hill fort Bojn\u00e1 I was protected by multiple walls as high as 6 meters with ditches and gates.[5] In the 9th century, the hill fort was intensely populated. Several craft workshops (mostly smithies) and thousands of artifacts[6] were unearthed on the place. Along with artisanal and agricultural tools, a large amount of weapons including typical battle axes, large knives, fragments of swords and seaxes. The presence of elite warriors can be documented by spurs, chain armors, gold-plated parts of military equipment, gold-coated and silver-coated adornments and other luxury objects.[7] The religious articles belong to the oldest Christian articles in Slovakia. The most important findings are a bronze bell of Canino type, fragments of other three bells and six gold-coated plaquettes with angels and Christ dated to 780-820,[8] dozen years before the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Two short inscriptions in Latin alphabet are the oldest evidence of writing in the Slovak history.[8]\n A large amount of weapon can be related to the violent destruction of the hill fort, probably by the old Hungarian units. According to radiocarbon data and other dating methods, the hill fort could be used less intense in the 10th century, later settlement is not documented.[7] The artifacts are displayed in Ponitrianske m\u00fazeum of Nitra. A local museum has opened in August 2007. Valy locality is currently being researched by an international archaeologist team.\n The village itself was first mentioned in 1424, though an incorporated settlement Mal\u00e9 Dvorany was first mentioned in the end of the 12th century. Before the world wars there was also a sizeable Jewish population here.  The synagogue, once the approximate size of the remaining church, has been turned into a bar and a sports hall.\n Football is a popular sport and the village hosts two male adult teams (Slovan Bojn\u00e1 and Mal\u00e9 Dvorany) plus several junior teams.\n Many of the locals and also outsiders have additional property used for recreation and gardening at the location called Vinohrad (vineyard) plus there are more cottages in the neighbouring forest. The forest itself is also used for mushroom picking by the villagers.\n A private mini-zoo and a ranch has been opened at the forest line near the upper end of the village.\n As of 2018, the eastern gate was reconstructed at the hillfort Bojn\u00e1 - Valy.

It is said to be the first ever institutions in Karnataka exclusively for teaching music and the first music college to be recognized and aided by the Government [2]\n.[3]\n He participated prominently in several music conferences and presided over the music conference in Bidaram Krishnappa\u2019s Prasanna Seetharama Mandiram, Mysore, in 1960. He also took part in various music related discussions and examination boards all over the country. He also sang in the courts of Mysore King Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV [4][5]\n Throughout his long and illustrious career spanning over six decades, he received many awards, titles, and accolades including the Karnataka State Sangita Nataka Academy award in 1963. In recognition for his contributions to Carnatic music, he was awarded the prestigious titles of 'Ganakalasindhu', 'Sangeet Vidwan', 'Ganakalakushala', and 'Nadasudhanidhi'. Besides receiving honors and felicitations in Karnataka, he was also honoured and felicitated in neighboring states such as Andhra Pradesh.\n One of his disciples, T.S. Vasanta Madhavi, founded the  D. Subbaramaiah Fine Arts Trust in Bangalore to mentor and encourage aspiring Carnatic musicians and singers. The Trust has been organising the Ragasri Music Festival [6] every year and has awarded titles and honorariums to several musicologists and writers. According to her, one of the major aspects of his unusual teaching approach was his sustained methodology of making one listen to as many genres of music as possible.[7] He would often encourage his students to be inquisitive and explore more.\n Another of his disciples, V. Ramarathnam [8] went on to become a prominent musicologist and has acknowledged his guru Sri D. Subbaramaiah in his autobiography, A MUSICIAN'S REMINISCENCES.\n Sri D. Subbaramaiah is often remembered during various Carnatic music festivals and similar occasions.[9] He died on 16 August 1986.\n", " RVAH-12 was a Reconnaissance Attack (Heavy) Squadron of the U.S. Navy. The squadron was established on 1 July 1965 and disestablished on 2 July 1979.[1]\n RVAH-12 was established on 1 July 1965 at NAS Sanford, Florida, the first squadron to specifically formed to operate the RA-5C Vigilante.  Early in its history, RVAH-12 was selected as the short-term host for a little known, and at the time, highly sensitive project known as Snare.  This involved the installation of an articulated infrared spectrum sensor on the top side of two aircraft, BuNo 148933 and BuNo 151727, just ahead of the vertical stabilizer.  The purpose of Snare was to obtain laser emitter and other related data from special Soviet Tu-16 Badger, Tu-95 Bear, and M-4 Bison long range bombers flying observation missions of U.S. Navy carrier battle groups from Russian soil.  Snare operations were conducted for a short period during RVAH-12's 1971-1972 Mediterranean deployment aboard USS\u00a0Independence.\n RVAH-12's Cold War / Vietnam-era deployments were as follows:\n With the end of the Vietnam War, RVAH-12 returned to stateside training and forward deployed Cold War presence operations aboard Fleet aircraft carriers.  In addition, budgetary pressures and force reductions following the end of the Vietnam War force the Department of Defense to once again close several stateside air bases, to include NAS Albany, Georgia. In January 1974, RVAH-12 shifted home stations from NAS Albany to NAS Key West, Florida.[11]\n RVAH-12's subsequent deployments were as follows:\n Attrition of airframes and the increasing maintenance and flight hour costs of the RA-5C in a constrained defense budget environment forced the Navy to incrementally retire the RA-5C and sunset the RVAH community beginning in mid-1974.  Carrier-based reconnaissance was concurrently conducted by the active duty VFP community at NAS Miramar and the Naval Reserve VFP community at Andrews AFB / NAF Washington with the RF-8G Crusader until 29 March 1987, when the last RF-8G was retired and the mission was fully transferred to the active duty and Naval Reserve VF community at NAS Miramar, NAS Oceana, NAS Dallas and NAS JRB Fort Worth as a secondary role with the F-14 Tomcat equipped with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS).\n Following its return from its final Mediterranean deployment in 1979, RVAH-12 was disestablished at NAS Key West on 2 July 1979 following 14 years and 1 day of active naval service.[12]\n The squadron was assigned to these home ports:\n \n", " Demofoonte is an opera in three acts by the Czech composer Josef Myslive\u010dek. It was the composer's first setting of this popular libretto by Metastasio first produced in 1733 (it was common in the second half of the eighteenth century for composers to set Metastasian texts two or more times over). This setting stays remarkably close to the original drama for its day (it was customary to alter Metastasian texts considerably so long after their original performances), but the role of Timante was augmented in order to highlight the talents of its interpreter, the distinguished male soprano Gaetano Guadagni. All of Myslive\u010dek's operas are of the serious type in Italian referred to as opera seria.\n The opera was first performed at the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice on 17 January 1769. It was very successful when it appeared. Indeed, the composer's first biographer, Franti\u0161ek Martin Pelcl, claimed that Venetian nobles stood in line outside of the theater to applaud his talents.[1] The role of Timante in this production was sung by the great castrato Gaetano Guadagni during the last portion of his long career. Myslive\u010dek's second version of Demofoonte premiered at the Teatro San Carlo, Naples in 1775.\n The overture composed for the opera is the most interesting aspect of the production, since it was extravagantly admired by the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  In a short note written to his sister from Milan on 22 December 1770, he urgently requested her to find out whether a copy of it was available in Salzburg.[2]  If not, he vowed to bring a copy back home with him.  Mozart used the overture as a source of musical motives in his own compositions for years.  There is no other attributable music not by Mozart to be found in the entire Mozart correspondence except for the notes of the beginning of the first violin part from this overture that were copied down by Mozart to help his sister identify it.\n The Thracian king Demofoonte asks the oracle of Apollo how long the practice of the annual sacrifice of a virgin will continue.  The answer is puzzling: \"as long as the innocent usurper sits on the throne\". The nobleman Matusio tries to protect his daughter Dircea from being sacrificed. He and Demofoonte are unaware that Dircea is secretly married to Timante, the son of Demofoonte and the heir to the throne. Demofonte wants Timante to marry Creusa, a princess of Phrygia. Timante's younger brother Cherinto is accompanying her to the kingdom of Thrace, however he falls in love with her. Meeting Creusa, Timante admits that he cannot marry her, but does not explain why. \n Dircea has been caught while trying to flee the country and imprisoned, and Demofoonte orders the immediate sacrifice of Dircea. Timante tries to release her but with no success. He is also imprisoned. Creusa asks Demofoonte for mercy. The king releases Timante and Dircea, and Timante decides to give up the throne in favour of Cherinto. \n Suddenly they find a letter revealing that Dircea is the daughter of Demofoonte, which makes Timante and Dircea brother and sister. Timante is in despair, and tries to avoid Dircea. However another letter reveals that Timante is the son of Matusio. Everybody is happy. The marriage of Timante and Dircea becomes legal, and Cherinto is the real crown prince and can marry Creusa. No more virgins are sacrificed, since Timante is no longer the \"innocent usurper of the throne\".\n Act I, scene 1 - Aria of Matusio, \"O pi\u00f9 non tremar non voglio\" \nAct I, scene 2 - Aria of Dircea, \"In te spero o sposo amato\" \nAct I, scene 3 - Aria of Demofoonte, \"Per lei fra l'armi\" \nAct I, scene 4 - Aria of Timante, \"Sperai vicino al lido\" \nAct I, scene 7 - Aria of Creusa, \"Non curo l'affetto\" \nAct I, scene 8 - Aria of Cherinto, \"Balena in quel sembiante\" [a non-Metastasian text] \nAct I, scene 12 - Aria of Dircea, \"Padre, perdona, o pene\" \nAct I, scene 14 - Accompanied recitative for Timante, \"Infelice Dircea\" \nAct I, scene 14 - Cavatina of Timante, \"Ah no, bell'idol mio\" \nAct I, scene 14 - Aria of Timante, \"Che fiero tormento\" [a non-Metastasian text] \n Act II, scene 1 - Aria of Creusa, \"Tu sai chi son tu sai\" \nAct II, scene 2 - Aria of Timante, \"Prudente mi chiedi?\" \nAct II, scene 4 - Aria of Matusio, \"Vado, ma d'una figlia\" [a non-Metastasian text] \nAct II, scene 6 - Aria of Dircea, \"Se tutti i mali miei\" \nAct II, scene 7 - Aria of Cherinto, \"No, non chiedo amate stelle\" \nAct II, scene 10 - Aria of Demofoonte, \"Perfidi, gi\u00e0 che in vita\" \n Act III, scene 1 - Aria of Adrasto, \"Non odi consiglio?\" \nAct III, scene 4 - Accompanied recitative for Timante, \"Misero me\" \nAct III, scene 5 - Duet for Dircea and Timante, \"La destra ti chiedo\" \nAct III, scene 5 - Aria of Timante, \"Misero pargoletto\" \nAct III, scene 7 - Aria of Dircea, \"Che mai risponderti\" \nAct III, scene 11 - Chorus, \"Par maggiore ogni diletto\"\n Score of Act I in manuscript available for viewing and downloading at http://www.internetculturale.it\n (Subcategory:  Digital Contents)\n", " \n The Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, commonly known simply as Fields Institute, is an international centre for scientific research in mathematical sciences at the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The institute is named for University of Toronto mathematician John Charles Fields, after whom the Fields Medal is also named. It was established in 1992, and was briefly based at the University of Waterloo before relocating to Toronto in 1995.\n As a centre for mathematical activity, the institute brings together mathematicians from Canada and abroad. It also supports the collaboration between professional mathematicians and researchers in other domains, such as statistics, computer science, engineering, physical and biological sciences, medicine, economics and finance, telecommunications and information systems. It also holds monthly meetings on mathematics education, attended by participants from secondary school boards, university mathematics departments and the private sector.\n The institute occupies a building at the university that was specially conceived and constructed for its activities, designed by Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects. It accommodates up to 66 visitors and their support staff, providing office spaces and full access to the mathematics collection of the University of Toronto Libraries.\n The Fields Institute Monographs (FIM) features the research work of the institute, and is jointly published with the American Mathematical Society.[1]\n In 2002, the Fields Institute initiated the Fields Institute Fellows program to recognize outstanding contributions to activities at the Fields Institute and within the Canadian mathematical community.[2] The Fellowship is a lifetime appointment. Winners of the CRM-Fields-PIMS prize are automatically recommended for fellowship.[2]\n", " \"Best Damn Night\" is the debut single by street dance group and British band Six D.

It was renamed Youngsville in his honor when the town was incorporated in 1875.[5][6]\n Notable area residents include country music singer Jason Michael Carroll.\n William A. Jeffreys House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.[7]\n Youngsville is located at 36\u00b01\u203231\u2033N 78\u00b028\u203238\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff36.02528\u00b0N 78.47722\u00b0W\ufeff / 36.02528; -78.47722 (36.025311, -78.477090),[8] near Raleigh, North Carolina. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6\u00a0square miles (4.1\u00a0km\u00b2), all of it land.\n As of the census[3] of 2010, there were 1,157 people, 522 households, and 294 families residing in the town.

The channel features hip-hop and urban contemporary music videos. The network, formerly known as MTV Jams, was rebranded under the BET banner on October 5, 2015.\n The channel debuted in 2002, replacing MTVX, a hard rock and heavy metal music network which debuted on August 1, 1998. The replacement of MTVX by MTV Jams was explained by the network as being based on demographic trends and industry data that there was a lower demand for a channel devoted to hard rock and heavy metal than there was for hip-hop, rap and R&B; as a result, Viacom management made the decision to launch a new music video network over MTVX's channel space. The network's name was taken from a two-hour daily program block on MTV, called MTV Jams, which ran from 1992 to 2000 and was also the general branding for urban music broadcast on the flagship channel.\n After its launch, MTV Jams' playlist became predictable and less random than it originally seemed. The new videos that were in heavy rotation were usually played once every one or two hours. MTV Jams was the last remaining MTV network in the United States to use MTV's original Kabel font for its music video credit tags, which the main MTV network discontinued in October 2007. MTV Jams switched to the font style used by MTV Hits and rarely by MTV itself in May 2011.\n The network's logo had a minor readjustment in February 2010 to remove the Music Television tagline and a small quarter of the logo in line with the official rebranding of all MTV networks. The network had its first full-fledged change in imaging on April 13, 2012, in line with the March 26 re-imaging of MTV Hits. A new logo and imaging was introduced on that date, featuring all text in bold Helvetica, including a minimal-style logo with the 2010 MTV logomark next to the word \"Jams\".\n The network was rebranded as BET Jams on October 5, 2015, to better align with BET. The channel continues to play hip-hop and urban contemporary videos as MTV's mainline networks, including MTV itself and MTV2, draw down their dependence on them. With the rebrand, MTV Live (formerly Palladia) along with MTVU remain as the only MTV-branded 24/7 video formatted networks with a music focus. A block of MTV Jams-branded music videos remains on MTV Live daily, presumably to prevent trademark dilution.[1]\n The channel uses an automated \"wheel\" schedule that was introduced during the early years of MTV2. A new loop starts at 6 a.m. Eastern Time, and then repeats at 2 p.m. and 10 p.m., usually under the EPG-only title of Music Playlist with little theming of video blocks (MTV Classic is also based on a completely automated schedule, though not on a wheel). Traditional direct response and promotional advertising and other interstitial programming is also carried on the network, along with various theme programming to promote album releases or other happenings in the music world. Beginning in the summer of 2004, MTV Jams added some variety to its programming. Along with MTV Hits, MTV Jams began to play more obscure videos, as well as a larger selection of older videos, than it had previously played. The automated wheel remained with the changeover to BET, though segments connected to MTV or MTV.com were discontinued.\n Currently, the breadth of BET Jams' playlist surpasses that of BET Soul, with several hundred more videos played on a regular basis. Most of the urban music videos that have ever aired on BET, MTV and VH1 are seen on MTV Jams, as well as many more obscure urban videos that cannot be seen on any other Viacom-owned network, though usually the channel does not air music preceding the 1989 premiere of Yo! MTV Raps, except for a few small cases. The relaunch as BET Jams was tied to the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards held nine days later, along with promotion for nominated artists and songs.\n The network has a weekly \"Jam of the Week\" which is announced on Sundays, with the video chosen receiving extended plays throughout the week.\n MTV Jams aired a frequent live game show, Hood Fab, hosted by Buttahman; in which two contestants (normally one popular hip-hop artist and one random contestant off of the street, although there have been games where two artists went against each other) are asked questions about hip-hop. The contests take place in various cities. The one who answers the most questions correctly gets a bonus question, to which a prize is awarded to that contestant. The artist normally just receives bragging rights and the \"Official Hood Fab tube socks\" while the random contestant will receive a prize of higher value as well as the tube socks.\n The channel also periodically aired a short-form program called The Parker Report, hosted by Erik Parker; in each episode, Parker featured hip-hop artists, normally under a theme (for instance, one episode featured the Grand Hustle team of T.I., Alfamega, and Big Kuntry King) to talk about issues in hip-hop. In the aforementioned episode, the four discussed the autotune \"T-Pain\" effect and about how he rediscovered it. The panel came to a conclusion about the issue discussed; for instance, the guests and host came to the conclusion to, when using the autotune, either \"shout out\" to T-Pain or feature him on the record. \n The network also aired the Ozone Awards for several years under a brokered programming arrangement.\n Occasionally, the network has aired air special, unannounced alphabetical marathons of music videos by artist name, usually around holiday periods, or videos themed around lists such as most popular of the year, nominated for certain awards or that of an artist around the release of a new album.\n From time to time, the network is also known to include special themed blocks of programming, for example, an hour of a specific artist or label's videos, an hour block of 1990s gangsta rap, or a string of reggae-style videos. These are always unannounced and spontaneous for viewers, in the vein of MTV2's original format.\n In the fall of 2004, MTV Jams presented a week of shows titled \"Takeover\", where artists were invited to host a day of programming. Artists included Usher, Kanye West, Lil Jon, Nelly, and Fat Joe (a format eventually picked up by competitor Fuse as the network drastically reduced their original programming due to budget issues). Each artist played their favorite videos and their own videos. Additionally, MTV specials such as Diary and live performance footage was played that related to the artists. This may have marked the first time the channel has ever aired any non-music video programming. In March 2005, MTV Jams invited 50 Cent to its studios to introduce his and his posse's music videos, as well as to play some of his favorite old school videos. He also spoke briefly between videos about his newest album and about his musical inspirations. At the time, these two specials were the closest to a VJ-presented program to ever appear on the channel.\n During the summer of 2005, MTV Jams debuted a new, larger logo in order to promote special programming called \"The Fab 5 of Summer '05\" that was running on the channel for the duration of that season. The \"Fab 5\" were five up-and-coming hip-hop artists that the channel placed a heavy emphasis on during the entire summer; these artists were Juelz Santana, Da Back Wudz, Young Jeezy, Tony Yayo, and Paul Wall. Da Back Wudz, Young Jeezy, Tony Yayo, and Paul Wall came into the MTV Jams studio to speak about their careers and to play blocks of their favorite videos. These blocks were rotated pretty heavily, sometimes several times a day, as such the summer of 2005 had arguably became the period of MTV Jams' history that has seen the most redundant and least varied playlist to date.\n That same summer, MTV Jams moved one step closer toward its high-budget, show-based sister networks MTV and VH1 when it briefly aired documentary style programs on the hip-hop themed and MTV-produced movie Hustle and Flow.\n BET Jams is available on the high-tier packages of most pay television providers, but was not available on Dish Network until 2016 (it remains unavailable on DirecTV). This is an artifact of the network's former editorial and operational control under MTV/Viacom Media Networks, where the channel was part of the digital cable-exclusive MTV/Nickelodeon Digital Suite.\n Time Warner Cable previously did not carry the network except on systems it owned that were formerly operated by Adelphia Communications, systems where previous contracts with MTV Networks are required to be honored, and Bright House Networks, of which Time Warner Cable had a stake in before both were a part of the 2017 merger into Charter Communications as Spectrum. This resulted in the network being unavailable in New York City outside of areas serviced by Cablevision; TWC was before the merger, the major cable provider for Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens. MTV Jams and its sister networks were added in the summer of 2012 as part of a wider agreement between Viacom and Time Warner Cable to allow access to its networks over TWC's tablet applications, along with its mobile apps.[2]\n The network is also carried on some pay-television providers in Latin America.\n", " Caribbean Airlines Limited is the state-owned airline and flag carrier of Trinidad and Tobago. Headquartered in Iere House in Piarco, the airline operates flights to the Caribbean, North America, Central America and South America from its base at Piarco International Airport. Presently Caribbean Airlines employs more than 1,700 people and is the largest airline in the Caribbean.[4]\n Caribbean Airlines was incorporated in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on 27 September 2006.\n In September 2006, following the recommendation of Peter Davies, the CEO of BWIA West Indies Airways, Caribbean Airlines got approval from the Trinidad and Tobago government to begin operations, after the failed negotiations between the unions and the management of its predecessor, BWIA. As a result, it was announced on 8 September 2006, that BWIA was to be shut down before the launch of Caribbean Airlines. During the last quarter of 2006, in an effort to scale down operations for the start of Caribbean Airlines, BWIA's management cut routes such as Manchester Airport, London Heathrow Airport, New York City and Toronto, with intermediate stops at Barbados or Antigua, ceased services to and from Saint Lucia, cut its fleet to six Boeing 737-800 aircraft retrofitted with wingtip devices (winglets) and reduced its staff to 800, with a majority of the staff former BWIA workers now contracted.\n The new airline's capital included funds to close and settle BWIA's operations.[5] The company commenced operations on 1 January 2007, servicing the remaining routes of BWIA.[6]\n Caribbean Airlines began operations with a fleet of six Boeing 737-800 aircraft and one Airbus A340-313, operating the London Heathrow route until May 2007. The airline offered two classes of service, first/business class and economy class on both the Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Caribbean Airlines operated daily direct services to Miami, Toronto, New York, Jamaica (with stops in Barbados and Antigua/St. Maarten), Guyana, Suriname and London Heathrow till May 2007 due to the ICC 2007 Cricket World Cup, all out of its hub at Piarco International Airport. Peter Davies resigned from his position as CEO, effective 30 September 2007, but remained as a strategic advisor to Caribbean Airlines.[7] In the first half of 2007, two Airbus A340-300 planes and a Boeing 737 Next Generation Boeing 737-800, 9Y-GND, were returned to International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Commercial Aviation Services (GECAS), respectively.\n On 1 October 2007, Philip Saunders, Star Alliance VP Commercial, was appointed the new Chief Executive Officer of Caribbean Airlines. Subsequently, the airline took over operations of Tobago Express, its domestic arm at a cost of US$24 million with the intentions to upgrade the fleet of Bombardier Dash-8 Q300 to international standards and also adding new Caribbean destinations to be served via this regional airline subsidiary.\n In March 2008, the airline added a daily direct service to the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport in Caracas, using the Dash 8 aircraft. In May 2008, Caribbean Airlines acquired a seventh Boeing 737-800 aircraft.[8] The airline added a new U.S. route on 22 May to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport from Piarco International Airport. This route began operations on a four times per week schedule and later in July of the same year, the frequency was increased to daily service.\n On 15 November 2008, Transavia Airlines agreed to operate a wet-lease operation on behalf of Caribbean Airlines, it increased its fleet to eight Boeing 737-800. The aircraft was re-fitted to the standard 16/138 configuration including an extra nine inches of seat pitch in the business class cabin, due to a different galley and closet placement. This allowed the airline to increase flight frequency to meet demand for the peak travel periods. The lease was contracted to be in effect until 15 April 2009. The aircraft was returned in June 2009, and Sun Country Airlines, a U.S. air carrier, then leased a Boeing 737-800 to Caribbean Airlines.\n In April 2009, the airline increased its frequency of service to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport in Caracas from a daily service to ten flights per week. The route was operated by the Bombardier Dash-8 Q300, configured for 50 passengers in an all economy service. Daily flights to its gateways Fort Lauderdale and Miami continued. Services to Toronto and New York City remained at twice daily and 20 weekly (up to 28 weekly in peak season), respectively.\n On 27 July 2009, Philip Saunders announced his resignation as CEO of Caribbean Airlines, due to personal reasons. Caribbean Airlines appointed Captain Ian Brunton in October 2009 as CEO of the airline.[9] Also in 2009, Caribbean Airlines operated services from the southern Caribbean to Jamaica, as well as South America, including Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela. The airline also continued to serve the United States and Canada, in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, New York City and Toronto, having also established a codeshare agreement with British Airways, for services to London and beyond. As of 2009, the airline operated a fleet of eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft and five Bombardier Dash-8 Q300 aircraft, out of its main hub at Piarco International Airport, Trinidad. The Dash 8 aircraft have since been replaced with new ATR 72-600 propjets.\n Caribbean Airlines Limited, through the government of Trinidad and Tobago, announced plans to operate a base in Jamaica following the divestment of Air Jamaica which was slated to occur between 30 April 2010 to that same period in 2011. Caribbean Airlines is providing a seamless transition following Air Jamaica's closure.\nWhen the deal is finalized, Caribbean Airlines Limited will become the largest airline in the Caribbean with a new hub in Kingston Jamaica's Norman Manley International Airport. The divestment was scheduled to become effective on 30 April 2010 after it was rescheduled from 12 April 2010. On this day, it was planned that Air Jamaica would cease operations and Caribbean Airlines will then acquire the airline's most profitable routes and their remaining six aircraft. Plans were also announced to replace the aircraft fleet with all Boeing 737-800 Next Generation jets.\n On 4 March 2010, Caribbean Airlines announced they would terminate their codeshare agreement with British Airways for the Port of Spain-London Gatwick route effective 27 March 2010 thus paving the way for a nonstop service to be operated by Caribbean between Piarco International Airport and London, UK.\n On 28 April 2010, Caribbean Airlines Limited and Air Jamaica signed a final agreement for the purchase of Air Jamaica by Caribbean Airlines Limited, following the signing of a letter of intent to merge in January of the same year. The agreement stated that Caribbean would continue operating Air Jamaica's routes and also retain 900 of Air Jamaica's employees. Financing was provided by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, which contributed around $50 million to complete the merger, and Jamaica, which assumed more than $800 million in costs related to the closure of Air Jamaica.[citation needed]\n In August 2010, Caribbean Airlines and Air India signed a travel pact for Trinidadians travelling to India. In October, the airline announced a fleet renewal consisting of fifteen (15) Boeing 737-800 Next Generation jets and nine ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft. The new Boeing jets were intended to replace Air Jamaica's operating fleet of Airbus aircraft.[10]\n On 27 May 2011, the acquisition of Air Jamaica was completed, with Finance Minister Winston Dookeran and Jamaican Finance Minister Audley Shaw at the Prime Minister' St. Clair office, signing the shareholding agreement. This agreement allows the Jamaican government to own a 16% stake of Caribbean Airlines Limited. On 28 October 2011, the U.S. Department of Transportation fined Caribbean Airlines $60,000 for limiting reimbursements for lost, damaged and delayed baggage to less than consumers were entitled under the Montreal Convention.[11]\n Talks have begun between Caribbean Airlines' management and LIAT (Leeward Islands Air Transport, a regional airline operating Dash 8 as well as ATR 42 and ATR 72 turboprop aircraft in the Caribbean) regarding a possible partnership or merger between the two airlines. The former Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Patrick Manning had also expressed interest in Cayman Airways also being merged into Caribbean Airlines, but, with the recent changes in government, the future of these plans is uncertain.\n According to Chairman of the Board of Caribbean Airlines George Nicholas III, Caribbean Airlines is pursuing a relationship with Star Alliance, the world's largest airline alliance, in an effort to support Jamaican hoteliers.[needs update] It is also reported they are preparing to start a route to Mumbai, but no date has been given. Also, Nicholas announced that Johannesburg, Nigeria, and Brazil are possible contenders for new routes. Chicago and Atlanta are the two new U.S. gateways that are being considered, Nicholas stated.[12]\n On 29 March 2013, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) fined the airline $100,000 for not providing passengers with an opportunity to leave a plane that was delayed on the tarmac at New York's JFK Airport for more than four hours.\n In early 2016, the management of Caribbean Airlines has set as an agenda to consider replacing its ATR fleet with comparable turboprops sourced from Bombardier due to persistent reliability problems. The former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Michael Di Lollo described the ATRs as \u201cnot mission capable\u201d after they suffered from frequent AOG (Aircraft On Ground) occurrences. On his recommendation, efforts were made to sourcing Dash 8-400 aircraft to replace the carrier's fleet of five ATR72-600s.[13]\n Also in early 2016, the airline returned its two Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to their lessor, coinciding with termination of its only European route to London Gatwick Airport on 10 January 2016, as part of a streamlining exercise to remove unprofitable routes.[14]\n The colors of Caribbean Airlines are blue, green and purple and are represented in the new staff uniforms, all featuring the hummingbird, the logo of Caribbean Airlines.\n BWIA's logo was a steelpan. Caribbean Airlines' image is a hummingbird in flight.[15] The image is a reference to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, where the island of Trinidad is known as \"the land of the hummingbird\".[16] All aircraft in the fleet carry the flag of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as the flag of CARICOM.[17]\n The airline had four designs on the tails of its de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 regional aircraft before these twin turboprops were phased out of the fleet (9Y-WIT was not painted),  One of the designs raised controversy, due to its usage of the Balisier flower, the symbol of the former ruling People's National Movement political party.[18] The logo was subsequently redesigned without the flower[19] and replaced with fruits. The tail designs featured a steelpan, cricket balls, fruits, corals, fish and butterflies.\n Caribbean Airlines has a theme song arranged in a traditional Trinidadian calypso music style. It was originally recorded by Explainer and the song is called \"Lorraine\".[20] The original lyrics, which talk about a man who needs to escape the cold United States and get back to the Caribbean,[21] were modified to fit Caribbean Airlines.\n Upon the airline's launch in January 2006, the airline retained the in-flight magazine, Caribbean Beat, and in-flight video, Caribbean Essence, of its predecessor BWIA. Caribbean Beat has been published since 1991 by Media and Editorial Projects Limited out of Trinidad and Tobago, and Caribbean Essence is produced by JCD & Associates, also out of Trinidad & Tobago. A new service Caribbean View was introduced in 2018, offering streaming entertainment directly to a personal device on board.\n Additionally, Caribbean Airlines continues to market itself as one of the few airlines still offering complimentary meals and refreshments.In September 2018, the airline introduced Caribbean Cafe which allows passengers to purchase local drinks, meals snacks and items such as plush toys and battery banks. The airline also introduced Caribbean Plus in 2018, which gives extra room in economy class for an added fee.In December 2014, Caribbean Airlines became the first airline to remove its fuel surcharge due to the reduction in jet fuel prices[22] and will introduce charges for a second checked bag, effective 1 February 2015.[23]\n The airline's frequent-flyer program is called Caribbean Miles.  This program offers many benefits to its members, and there is no joining fee.  The three tiers of the program are called Silver, Gold and Executive Gold.\n \nCaribbean Airlines operates scheduled services to the following destinations including incorporated services formerly operated by Air Jamaica.\n As of May 2019, the Caribbean Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:[25]\n  Media related to Caribbean Airlines at Wikimedia Commons\n \n", " The 2011 Africa Cup was the eleventh edition of this tournament.

They are often considered to be a branch of the Darumbal.[1]\n Though often thought to have spoken the Darumbal language, an early settler of the island, Robert Ross, stated that their language was unintelligible to the mainland aborigines.\n \"their \"yabbering\" is altogether unintelligible to the blacks of the mainland.\"[2] According to an early sojourner, C. T. Wyndham, the language spoken was divided into two distinct dialects, northern and southern. This was disputed by another white informant who said that mainland blacks in that area could understand the Woppaburra language.[3]\n The Woppaburra were described by white settlers as small in stature, the hair of a reddish-brown tint, and their bodies covered in downy hair and living predominantly in natural caverns, and subsisting on a diet of fish and tubers since natural land game, such as kangaroos, opossums and wallabies, was absent from the island.[4] Their numbers, as pastoral lease-holders began to establish a foothold on their territory in the 1860s, were believed to be about 60 people,[2] and W. T. Wyndham reported later that during his own sojourn on the island in 1883-4, he counted 54.[5] Archibald Meston in 1902 estimated the original population before contact to be around 200. Disparities overall numbers may reflect headcounts for the separate islands, and Rowland makes an estimate of the total Woppaburra before contact to be around 60 on South Keppel and a further 25 on the northern island.[6]\n Anthropometric studies have suggested the Woppaburra were quite distinct from the mainland peoples, one 1976 study concluding that, their bone remains constitute the \"most striking instance we have seen of micro-evolution within the Australian Aborigines\".[7]\n According to Michael Rowland, an authority on the Woppaburra writing in part to reply to the skepticism about reports of genocide advanced by Keith Windschuttle, the first visit of whites to the island occasioned a massacre of seven/eight members of the tribe: not mentioned in the report of the expedition, which spoke of an incident in which a fleeing gin, or aboriginal woman, had been saved by the group after she fell into the sea and injured herself, this or perhaps an earlier occasion of slaughter, was pointed out by tribal people later, who showed a hundred-yard line pitted with the skeletal remains of the Woppaburra who had been killed.,[8] and several males, accused of killing some sheep, were transported off the terrain, to Yeppoon, where the local tribes viewed them with hostility. The then lessee however stated that a full 30 had been removed, at their request, to the mainland, and relocated, after landing at a place 10 miles south of Cape Manifold, at the Water Park Native Reserve, while leaving only two native women (gins) behind.[3] Robert Ross's pastoral lease ran 3-4,000 sheep on island.[9] Another white version at the time (1883) claimed that the Woppaburra were not native to the island but had managed, being part of a mainland tribe, to get over to the island and kill a 100 sheep, and that this accounted for their removal.[10] According to testimony given to Walter Roth, however, some whites and mainland blacks had descended on the island, and hunted up all the Woppaburra women and children they could find, and had them transported back to the coast. \"Human lives were sacrificed for sheep,\" was his conclusion.[11] Ross may have shifted them to the mainland to supply cheap labour for property at Taranganba.[12]\n Deracinated on the mainland, and unable to adapt to Yeppoon conditions, where they eventually were said to have retired to, reports quickly noted that the transported group was rapidly dying off -though one man, Yoolowa/Lowoo, was said to have swum back to Keppel island and others were eaten by sharks in attempts to get back to their homeland- as a result of \"coast fever\" and an inability to live off the different diet. Corpses of Woppaburra were found here and there in scrubland and along the beaches.[13] Reports from the mid-1880s indicate that some Woppaburra remained on the island, used as cheap labour on the sheep-runs, men and women whipped along as, harnassed to a plough, they were forced to furrow the soil, and fed tidbits thrown their way by whites. They were chained to a tidal cave if they refused to work.[11]\n Something akin to frontier warfare, involving not only shootings, poisonings, and being driven into the sea, but also theft of their women by Japanese pearlers, appears to have struck the Woppaburra, according to the tales handed down by descendants of the tribe in both Yeppoon and Emu Park\n Ross's Keppel interests were taken over by his foreman, James Lucas, in 1897 and he moved the Woppaburra to South Keppel island near his homestead. At the same time, in the late 1890s, a dispute over territorial competence arose between the northern protector of Queensland's aboriginal peoples, and his southern colleague Archibald Meston. Roth they insisted not be dislocated from the islands, and was thought to favour the lessee's interests, while Meston was shocked by the degraded conditions to which the Woppaburra had been reduced in the introduced pastoralist environment.[14] Roth reported 19 Woppaburra full-bloods on the island in 1898, 3 of them male, and 16 female, a disparity he attributed to the character of the Europeans who frequented the isle. Meston wanted them shifted to Fraser Island to isolate them from sexually predatory whites and fishermen.[15]\n The remnants of the Woppaburra were forcibly removed from the island in 1902,[16] though one descendant claims his family was removed 8\u00a0years later, in 1910.[17] The skeletal remains of 2 Woppaburra people were removed to museum holdings in London, in the 1920s, and were conserved at the Royal College of Surgeons and London's Natural History Museum.[18] In the early 1980s The keppel Islands Lifestyle Aborigninal Corporation (K.I.L.A.C) was formed by the initiative of Woppaburra descendants Elders Aunty Glenice Croft, Aunty Linette Van Issum, Uncle Robert Barney, Aunty Ethel Richards, Aunty Heather Saunders, Aunty Ruthy Cummings and their children Michelle Croft, Angela & Sonny Van Issum. Where the K.I.L.A.C media person Aunty Glenice Croft contacted Michael Rowland after media coverage about Mr Rowland's archaeological survey on the Keppel Islands he meant Aunty Ethel Richards, Aunty Glenice Croft and others which lead to the first Woppaburra reunion return in 1984 when 40 descendants met up on Great Keppel island.\n On 7 March 2014, the registration of a claim to native title made in November 2013 in the name of descendants of the Woppaburra was accepted by the National Native Title Tribunal.[19]\n The term we al-li was adopted from the Woppaburra language to denote a therapy devised for indigenous peoples affected by the historic traumas of dispossession. We denoted \"fire\", while al-li meant \"water\", and the phrase was coined to refer to a raging anger and the cleansing process (fire) and mourning grief, with the healing properties that rain brings to a desiccated landscape.[20]\n Some 300 Australians trace their origins to the Woppaburra of the Keppel Islands.[21]\n", " Shasan is a village and a gram panchayat in Barasat II CD Block in Barasat Sadar subdivision of North 24 Parganas district in the state of West Bengal, India.\n Shashan police station serves a total population of 139,328.

The unincorporated community of Grand Portage and the Grand Portage Indian Reservation are both located within Grand Portage Unorganized Territory of Cook County.\n The adjacent Grand Portage National Monument designated a National Monument in 1958, lies entirely within the boundaries of the Grand Portage Ojibwe Indian Reservation, the reconstructed depot celebrates fur trade and Ojibwe lifeways. The British North West Company built its inland headquarters at Grand Portage; the post was active until 1802.\n According to the United States Census Bureau, the unorganized territory has a total area of 192.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (498.7\u00a0km2), of which, 74.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (192.2\u00a0km2) of it is land and 118.3\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (306.5\u00a0km2) of it (61.46%) is water.\n Minnesota Highway 61 serves as a main route in the area.\n The community of Grand Portage is located 34 miles northeast of the city of Grand Marais; and 6 miles southwest of the Canada\u2013US border.\n The following unincorporated communities are located within Grand Portage Unorganized Territory:\n Grand Portage has a humid continental climate that is prevalent throughout the state. Its version is significantly cooler in summers than more southerly areas and somewhat more severe in winters. Precipitation is dominant in summers, but can render some high volumes of snowfall.\n Beginning in the 17th century Grand Portage became a major center of the fur trade. See Canadian Canoe Routes (early). It was at the point where a major canoe fur trade route of the voyageurs left the great lakes. It was so named because the route began with a huge 9 mile portage.[3] A portage is a place where the canoes and equipment are carried over land. The French established this trade with the Native Americans until the British took it over in the 18th century after the Seven Years' War. The North West Company established the area as its regional headquarters. Soon Grand Portage became one of Britain's four main fur trading posts, along with Niagara, Detroit, and Michilimackinac.[4] Even after the American Revolutionary War and victory by the rebellious colonists, the British continued to operate in the area. Under the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Britain had to cede former territory to the United States, including this area.\n Finally with the signing of the Jay Treaty in 1796 defining the northern border between Canada and the US, British traders planned to move from Grand Portage. They wanted to avoid the taxes the US put on their operations, in its effort to encourage American traders instead. In 1802 the traders planned to move north to create a new center, what they called Fort William. In 1803 following the Louisiana Purchase, in which the U.S. acquired the lands to the west of Grand Portage, the British finally moved from Grand Portage to the new post in Canada.[5] The North West Company moved its headquarters northward to what they named Fort William.  After British fur traders abandoned the area, it rapidly declined economically until fisheries and logging became popular in the 19th century.\n As of the census[6] of 2000, there were 557 people, 247 households, and 137 families residing in the unorganized territory. The population density was 7.5 people per square mile (2.9/km\u00b2). There were 286 housing units at an average density of 3.9/sq\u00a0mi (1.5/km\u00b2).

After his release in 2001, he supported government reform plans.\n In 2001, Hussain chaired the committee which founded Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition party. He urged opposition leaders to boycott 2002 parliamentary election after the king issued Constitution of 2002, which he found going back on reform plans. In 2003, Hussain announced he would leave politics and stop issuing public statements and in 2005 he resigned from Al Wefaq. In 2009 He returned to politics becoming the co-founder and official spokesman of Al Wafa' Islamic Movement.\n During the Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present), Hussain played an important role, leading protests, calling for the downfall of regime and establishment of a democratic republic. One month after the beginning of protests, he was arrested, allegedly tortured and sentenced by a special military court to life imprisonment. Later, sentence was overturned, and it was announced that he would be retried by a civilian court. The retrial began on 22 May 2012, but was postponed until May 29.\n Hussain was born to a poor family in the village of Nuwaidrat south of Manama. He studied in Ma'ameer primary school[1] and upon his graduation when he was twelve, his father died.[5] Hussain continued his study at Sitra intermediate school (then Isa Town secondary school).[1] At 1977, he graduated from Kuwait University with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and sociology.[2]\n Upon graduation, he worked as a teacher for three years, then as a social supervisor for fifteen years before being forced to retire as a result of his activities during 1990s uprising in Bahrain.[2] Thirteen years later, Hussain resumed his previous job for three years,[1] before being terminated in 2008.[6]\n Between December 1994 and February 2001, Bahrain saw large number of protests and political unrest when leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces to demand democratic reforms.\n Hussain was one of the most prominent opposition leaders in the uprising. \"Although the late Shaikh Abdul Amir al-Jamri was the religious leader of the Shia oppositionists at the time, Hussain's admirers claim he was the thinker behind the unrest\", a WikiLeaks cable said.[7] He was a subscriber of the petition calling for resurrection of parliamentary life in 1992,[6] a member of the \"Petition Committee\" in 1994, and of the \"Initiative\" in 1995.[2] Instead of going into exile like many other activists, Hussain remained in Bahrain.[8] He was arrested twice[2] under the State Security Law, which allowed the government to arrest individuals without trial for a period of up to three years of administrative detention for crimes relating to state security.[9]\n Hussain was detained for about six months between 17 March 1995 and 10 September. He and other members of the \"Initiative\" were released after reaching a deal with the government in which the Initiative members would calm people in exchange for the government's releasing all of those not convicted in courts. The government reportedly also agreed that at a later stage after establishment of security, the government would start a political dialogue with opposition. However, the government denied such an agreement existed, which led to worsening the situation again.[2]\n Hussain was arrested for the second time on January 1996 along with 7 other opposition leaders including Abdul Amir al-Jamri and Hasan Mushaima. They were held in Al-Qalaa prison.[3] This time Hussain spent about five years in prison in solitary confinement[5] and was allegedly mistreated.[3] According to the Bahrain Human Rights Organisation, Hussain was pressured early in 2000 by three State Security and Intelligence Service personnel\u2014Adel Flaifel and two \"British officers\"\u2014to sign a pre-prepared paper apologizing to the Emir for his actions and promising \"not to carry out acts calling for political reform, or incite others to do so, and not to partake in any public speaking, including religious sermons\" in exchange for getting pardoned by the Emir. Hussain refused to sign.[3]\n On 14 March 2000, the High Court of Appeal issued an order to release Hussain. He was released three days later, but was re-arrested from his house only one hour after his return. According to the family, police promised that he would again be released after two days, after they completed arrangements for the release. Later, the family was told that Hussain would spend another three years in prison under the State Security Law.[10]\n Despite getting a release verdict from the Court of Cessation on 17 November 2000, Hussain was kept in detention until 5 February 2001, when the new Emir brought several political reforms to the country. Opposition activists made intensive contacts and discussions to decide upon accepting or refusing the National Action Charter of Bahrain proposed by the Emir.[2]\n The Charter called for \"a constitutional monarchy, an independent judiciary and a bicameral legislature made-up of a lower house of elected representatives and an upper house of appointed legislators. The charter also gave equal rights to men and women, with all citizens having equal political rights and being entitled to elections and candidacy according to the law\".[11]\n On 8 February, only three days after his release, Hussain and three other prominent political leaders\u2014Abdul Amir al-Jamri, Abdulla Al-Guraifi and Ali Rabea\u2014met with the Emir. As a result, the opposition accepted the Emir's initiative.[2] Hussain \"worked hard\" to convince people (specially Shia) to accept the National charter,[7] which later gained 98.4% \"Yes\" votes.[2]\n Hussain was a founding member of Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition party, established on 9 July 2001. He chaired the \"Preparatory Committee\" between 25 September and 11 November then moved to work on other areas.[2] When the Emir (who now became a king) officially declared the Constitution of 2002, opposition considered it going back on his public promise of 2001. Hussain urged many opposition leaders to boycott the parliamentary elections,[7] calling the participation \"unethical action\".[12]\n Hussain led the Islamic Enlightenment institution in 2002,[2] before resigning in March 2003[13] and announcing that he would refrain from issuing public statements and leading Friday sermons in August. As a result, a number of his admirers gathered in a two-day sit in front of his house to dissuade him from his decision. Isa Qassim, Bahrain's top Shia cleric, visited him twice for the same purpose. However, Hussain kept his position, thanking all of those who stood by him. He said his decision was not due to a personal interest and that the \"issue is larger than using courtesy with it\".[14] In 2005, Hussain officially resigned from Al Wefaq after the society decided to register under the \"political societies law\" and participate in the elections.[15]\n On 6 February 2009, Hussain and Abduljalil al-Miqdad, a senior Shia cleric, announced the establishment of a new opposition group: Al Wafa' Islamic Movement. They immediately began a ten-day hunger strike demanding the release of Haq Movement leaders Hassan Mushaima and Mohammed Habib al-Miqdad. According to a Wikileaks cable, the hunger strike attracted support from a wide range of opposition and human rights spectrum including Abduljalil al-Singace of Haq Movement, a \"few members\" of Al Wefaq and Abdulhadi al-Khawaja of Front Line Defenders. According to the cable, the hunger strike \"achieved little\", but \"announce[d] the return of Abdulwahab Hussein to the opposition scene\".[7]\n Starting from 6 March, Hussain, who became the official spokesman of the newly formed movement, visited a number of Shia villages holding open seminars to explain its goals and means of action. The seminars were described by many observers to be similar to those held during the 1990s by opposition leaders. Aiming to get legitimacy and support, Hussain and al-Miqdad met with Isa Qassim; however, a leaked Wikileaks cable reported that the latter \"was not impressed\".[7]\n Despite remaining small, Al Wafa' is a noted discussion topic among Bahraini politicians. It was described by a Wikileaks cable as having \"the potential to appeal to more pious Shia\" due to the \"stature and credibility\" of Hussain as a \"conservative leader\" and having the \"Religious Cover\" of Abduljalil al-Miqdad, which is a \"must\" in order to gain \"popular support in the Shia community\".[7]\n Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured.[16]\n Hussain played a leading role in first days of the Bahraini uprising.[17] He led a protest in the early morning of 14 February 2011 in his village Nuwaidrat, which police attacked.[18] On 8 March, Al Wafa, Haq Movement and Bahrain Freedom Movement formed a \"Coalition for a [Bahraini] Republic\",[19] calling for the downfall of the current regime by escalation of peaceful protests and the establishment of a democratic republic. While they accepted a western-style constitutional monarchy in principle, saying it was \"not very different from a republic\", they doubted the regime would voluntarily implement such a radical change and argued that toppling it was unavoidable.[20]\n Hussain was arrested in the early hours of 17 March 2011 along with other protest leaders.[17] He later described the arrest by saying: \"While arresting me, I got beaten, kicked and had my head hit by the wall and started bleeding. My daughter Aqeela (20 years old) was also beaten by the rifle butt.\" Hussain also reported that security forces stole money and electronic devices from his house during the arrest and continued to beat him while being transported to prison.[21] In prison, he was interrogated by National Security Agency[22] and was reportedly tortured with \"water, spitting in the mouth, kissing the shoes of torturers under threat of beatings\".[21] He was kept in solitary confinement for weeks.[22]\n In November, Hussain said he and other activists read and studied Manama Paper, a document issued by five opposition parties listing a number of demands. However, he said, \"we do not have a trend so far to issue an opinion on the document\". He also emphasized on \"sticking to the peaceful approach and not to be drawn to violence\" and \"avoiding collision with other views\", his son reported.[23]\n The first hearing for Hussain and twenty other activists (seven of whom were absent) was on 8 May. They were brought before a special military court called the National Safety Court, where they were able to see their families for the first time since their arrest.[22] Bahrain Centre for Human Rights reported that lawyers were notified less than twelve hours before the trial. Their case was referred to by Bahrain News Agency as the \"terrorist organization\". The defendants were faced with twelve different charges including \"[o]rganising and managing a terrorist group for the overthrow and the change of the country's constitution and the royal rule\".[4] The National Safety Lower Court adjourned the hearing to 12 May,[24] when the activists denied all charges against them and some international human rights organisations said they were not allowed to enter court.[25] It was again postponed to 16 May.[4]\n On the fourth hearing on 22 May, Lieutenant Isa Sultan, who was brought as a witness, said the activists were following Iranian and Hezbollah orders and that they received financial aid from them to \"buy gas and car tires for the youth to burn on the streets\".[4]\n On 22 June, Hussain and seven other activists\u2014Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, Abduljalil al-Miqdad, Abduljalil al-Singace, Hassan Mushaima, Mohammed Habib al-Miqdad, Saeed al-Nouri and Saeed al-Shehabi\u2014were sentenced to life imprisonment after the court found them guilty of \"plotting a coup against the government\" and \"having links to a terrorist organization abroad\" - a clear reference to allegations that \"Iranian-backed Hezbollah\" was responsible for the uprising.[26] The other thirteen activists were given sentences between two and fifteen years.[4] According to relatives, activist raised their fists in the air and shouted \"peacefully\" when their sentences were issued.[27] Hussain said to the judge \"I don't recognize you, your court or who employed you\", witnesses reported.[28] As a result, they were taken out the courtroom by force.[29] According to witnesses, security officers in the courtroom exchanged congratulations publicly.[4] Their appeal hearing on 29 June[4] was postponed to 6 September.[22]\n On 24 September, Hussain and other jailed opposition leaders started a hunger strike demanding the release of more than forty women arrested, reportedly humiliated and beaten one day earlier after protesting inside a shopping mall.[30][31] As a result, the prison administration reportedly punished Hussain and the others by denying them health care, reportedly leading to deterioration of Hussain and Abduljalil al-Singace health conditions.[31] Hussain denied news spread by one of Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry employees that they were getting good health care and said he and the other activists have disassembled their hunger strike on 4 October due to \"complete medical negligence by prison administration\", his son reported.[32]\n On 28 September, the National Safety Court of Appeal endorsed all the convictions and sentences in a session that only lasted for few minutes.[22] On 2 April 2012, activists case was moved to the civilian Court of Cessation.[33] The next hearing on 23 April was postponed to 30 April,[34] when one activist, Al-Hur\nYousef al-Somaikh was released, after his sentence was reduced from two years to six months. The remaining thirteen were supposed to stand a retrial before the High Criminal Court of Appeal on 8 May. However, the hearing was postponed to 22 May due to the health conditions of al-Mahroos and al-Khawaja who was on hunger strike; both of them had been hospitalized. On 22 May, Hussain said he was tortured in 2011 to obtain confessions and beaten when he refused to record an apology to the king. The hearing was postponed to 29 May.[22]\n In a statement announced by his spokesman, Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations called for the release of all \"political detainees\" appealing to the \"highest level\" of government of Bahrain to \"ensure the application of due process and respect for international human rights norms\".[35] Rupert Colville, spokesman of OHCHR said the sentences were \"harsh\" and expressed his \"severe concern\" due to \"serious due process irregularities\".[35] Mark Toner, State Department spokesman of United States urged Bahrain government to \"abide by its commitment to transparent judicial proceedings, conducted in full accordance with Bahrain's international legal obligations\" and said the U.S. was \"concerned about the severity of the sentences and the use of the military-linked security courts\". He also cited President Barack Obama's remarks the previous month that \"such steps are at odds with the universal rights of Bahrain's citizens\".[26] Alistair Burt, a British Foreign Officer expressed extreme concern[29] from the trial process and said \"It is deeply worrying that civilians are being tried before tribunals chaired by a military judge, with reports of abuse in detention, lack of access to legal counsel and coerced confessions\".[27]\n The verdicts drew wide criticism from human rights organisations citing them as examples of \"political and summary justice\".[27] Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director of Human Rights Watch said the charges were politically motivated and the trials unfair.[27] Amnesty International criticized trying civilians in a military court calling the trials unfair. \"[T]he court failed to adequately investigate allegations that some of the defendants were tortured and made to sign false confessions, which seem to have been used as evidence against them,\" said Malcolm Smart, the organisation Middle East and North Africa programme director.[27]\n Nabeel Rajab, the president of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights criticized the trials saying they do not meet international standards. \"The people were sentenced for expressing their opinion and for opposing the government,\" he said.[4] Ali Salman, head of Al Wefaq said the convictions go against recommendations by Barack Obama to restore clam before the start of a national dialogue.[29] Khalil al-Marzooq, a leader in Al Wefaq said trials were \"hurting the country's international standing\".[29] Saeed al-Shehabi, leader of London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement who was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia, said accusations were invalid calling the government's reaction \"draconian\". \"The world has seen how peaceful the demonstrations were. [Y]et, they were condemned as being terrorists,\" he said.[36]\n Hundreds of protesters tried to reach the site of Pearl Roundabout, but were teargassed by security forces. In Shia villages, protesters took to the streets only to be taken back by riot police.[26] Bahrain government said the activists were behind \"bringing the country to the brink of total anarchy\" and that \"[t]oday's sentencing sends a message that law and order will be preserved\".[26]\n Hussain has written a number of books in Arabic including:[1]\n In a leaked Wikileaks cable dated to 19 October 2009, the US Embassy in Bahrain described Al Wafa' as a part of the \"radical opposition\" that uses ideology and religious credibility to gain supporters. The same cable quoted Mansoor Al-Jamri, editor-in-chief of the independent daily newspaper Al-Wasat, saying he was \"concerned\" about Hussain, because he was \"a religious ideologue who has throughout his life gravitated to the extreme end of the Shia spectrum\".[7]\n", " Suwandi Siswoyo (born March 10, 1972 in Gresik Regency) is an Indonesian football player and manager who previously plays as defender for Persegres Gresik, Petrokimia Putra, Persija Jakarta, PSM Makassar, Perseden Denpasar, Persib Bandung, PKT Bontang, Persita Tangerang, Mitra Kukar FC and the Indonesia national team.[1]\n \n", " Podborze [p\u0254d\u02c8b\u0254\u0290\u025b] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Radomy\u015bl Wielki, within Mielec County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland.[1] It lies approximately 7 kilometres (4\u00a0mi) north-east of Radomy\u015bl Wielki, 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) south-west of Mielec, and 53\u00a0km (33\u00a0mi) north-west of the regional capital Rzesz\u00f3w.\n \n Coordinates: 50\u00b014\u203200\u2033N 21\u00b020\u203200\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff50.2333\u00b0N 21.3333\u00b0E\ufeff / 50.2333; 21.3333\n", " The British Kendo Association was founded in 1964 as a non-profit making organisation to foster and develop the practise and spirit of Kendo, Iaido and J\u014dd\u014d along traditional lines with the objectives of:\n The BKA is the only organisation in the UK which is recognised for Kendo, Iaido and Jodo by the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei (the foremost body in Japan for these martial arts), the International Kendo Federation and Sport England.

Owned by Dreamcatcher Broadcasting, LLC, the station is operated under a shared services agreement (SSA) by the Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary of the Tribune Media Company. WNEP-TV's studios are located on Montage Mountain Road in Moosic, and it shares transmitter facilities with PBS member WVIA-TV (channel 44) at the Penobscot Knob antenna farm near Mountain Top.\n There were originally two ABC network affiliates in northeastern Pennsylvania. WILK-TV, operating on channel 34 and owned by WILK radio took to the air from Wilkes-Barre on September 16, 1953.[4] It was followed by Scranton-licensed WARM-TV, broadcasting on channel 16 and owned by future Governor William Scranton along with WARM radio, in February 1954.[5] During the late 1950s, WILK-TV was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.[6]\n WILK wanted to get a head start on the other local stations when it signed on in 1953, going on the air at 2\u00a0p.m. rather than the 3\u00a0pm sign on that the other stations did. The engineers got the signal ready by noon and decided to take a break. However, at lunch, they turned on the station to inspect their handiwork, only to find the signal was dead. They rushed back and were able to establish the link by 1:50\u00a0p.m., 10 minutes before sign-on.[7]\n Getting a signal from ABC headquarters in New York City was a challenge in the early days with no access to satellites. As a result, WILK set up a microwave tower in Effort, about 45 miles (72\u00a0km) east of Wilkes-Barre. From there, the network signal was bounced to the Penobscot Knob transmitter site. Often, station engineers had to adjust the Effort transmitter to accept a signal from WFIL-TV (now ABC O&O WPVI-TV) in Philadelphia if they were unable to receive the New York feed.\n WILK-TV and WARM-TV were both losing money, in large part because their network, ABC, was not on an equal footing with NBC and CBS (and would not be until the 1970s). However, they stayed on the air because they were owned by well-respected local radio stations.\n By 1955, however, it was obvious that Scranton and Wilkes-Barre were going to be a single television market. In late 1957, WILK-TV and WARM-TV agreed to merge into a single ABC station for Northeastern Pennsylvania. The merged station, then as now, operated under WILK-TV's license, but used WARM-TV's channel 16 in order to provide wider signal coverage at less cost\u2014no small consideration given the station's vast and mostly mountainous coverage area. Transcontinent Television Corporation, a Buffalo, New York-based media firm, acquired a 60 percent interest in the merged station; the remaining shares were split between the WARM and WILK groups, with William Scranton as chairman.[8] The merged station, WNEP-TV, was licensed to Scranton, and split operations between WILK-TV's former facility in Wilkes-Barre and a new studio in Scranton. In 1962, WNEP-TV consolidated its operations at a new studio near Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport in Avoca. WILK-TV's transmitter site at Penobscot Knob was retained by WNEP-TV, and the WARM-TV transmitter was donated a decade later to the area's PBS member station, WVIA-TV (channel 44).\n Meanwhile, the WILK-TV facility was repurposed as a satellite repeater of WNEP-TV until late summer 1958.[9][10] The channel 34 assignment was later reallocated to Binghamton, New York, to be occupied by ABC affiliate WBJA-TV (now WIVT) beginning in 1962.[11][12]\n Despite a power boost to 1.5 million watts, and an increased coverage area\u2014expanded to 15 counties in northeastern Pennsylvania[7]\u2014WNEP-TV bounced back and forth in the ratings for most of the next two decades. It was never able to achieve any consistency because of the bitter rivalry between Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Viewers in Wilkes-Barre thought it was a Scranton station, while viewers in Scranton thought it was a Wilkes-Barre station. It was also hobbled by being an affiliate of the smallest and weakest network of the time. Indeed, WNEP's launch made Scranton/Wilkes-Barre the smallest market in Pennsylvania with full service from all three networks.\n Transcontinent exited broadcasting in 1964 and sold several of its stations, including WNEP-TV, to Taft Broadcasting.[13][14] When Taft purchased Philadelphia independent station WIBF-TV (channel 29, now WTXF-TV) in 1969,[15] it sought a waiver to keep both stations. Channel 16's Grade B signal reaches the Lehigh Valley, which is part of the Philadelphia market. WNEP-TV had also operated an outlying translator on channel 7 in Allentown for many years. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) normally did not allow one company to own two stations with overlapping coverage areas. While it initially granted the waiver, it reversed itself four years later and forced Taft to sell channel 16. A group of WNEP-TV station employees and executives formed NEP Communications, which bought the station from Taft in late 1973.[16]\n Soon after NEP took over the station, news director Elden Hale decided to take a regional approach. He billed the station as serving \"Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania,\" and stepped up coverage of the remote portions of the market. These areas had largely been ignored by the other stations in town. He also added the area's first news helicopter. This approach quickly paid off. In November 1976, WNEP surged to first place for the first time in a decade. After briefly falling back to second it returned to number one in 1978, around the same time ABC became the nation's number one network. Apart from a brief period in the mid 1990s when WBRE-TV passed it, it has been number one ever since. NEP also established a remote production company, which operated as an adjunct to WNEP-TV.\n The New York Times Company bought the station in 1985.[17]  WNEP moved to its current studios in Moosic in 1989; the facility is similar to the building the Times Company built for sister station WHNT-TV in Huntsville, Alabama, but on a larger scale. NEP Communications retained the production unit, which became NEP Broadcasting; the company provided remote broadcast facilities for the Olympics, FIFA World Cup and the Academy Awards, as well as a studio production facility in New York City.[18]\n On January 4, 2007, the station, along with the rest of the Times Company's television division, was sold to Oak Hill Capital Partners in a $575 million transaction. Oak Hill formed Local TV as a holding company for its stations.[19]\n On July 1, 2013, Local TV announced that its 19 stations would be acquired by the Tribune Company for $2.75 billion;[20] Tribune owns The Morning Call in Allentown. Although Allentown is part of the Philadelphia television market, WNEP has long claimed the Lehigh Valley as part of its coverage area. The FCC ruled that Tribune could not keep WNEP due to its ban on newspaper-television cross-ownership within a single market, The Morning Call serving a city within WNEP's coverage area (although Tribune has maintained cross-ownership waivers for its newspaper-television station combinations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Hartford). Tribune spun off WNEP-TV to Dreamcatcher Broadcasting, an unrelated company owned by former Tribune Company executive Ed Wilson.[21] However, Tribune will operate the station and provide other services under a shared services agreement, and will hold an option to buy back WNEP outright in the future.[22] The sale was completed on December 27.[23] Tribune later announced on July 10, 2013 that it would spin off its newspapers (including The Morning Call) into a separate company, the Tribune Publishing Company, in 2014, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.[24]  The split was completed in August 2014, though as of yet Tribune has not announced plans to acquire Dreamcatcher outright.\n WNEP-TV's transmission tower broadcasting the analog signal on channel 16 collapsed on December 16, 2007, due to severe ice, winds, and snow at the transmitter location on Penobscot Knob.[25] The tower collapse also destroyed the transmitter building. No one was injured during the incident.[25] WCLH's FM antenna and transmitter, which was co-located on WNEP's analog TV tower, was also destroyed during the incident.[26] Transmission of the digital signal on channel 49 was restored after a brief interruption of power to the tower supporting the digital transmitter and antenna. WNEP's signal on local cable systems and satellite was restored by the end of the day on December 16, 2007. WNEP-TV partially restored its analog over the air TV signal by January 1, 2008[27] by broadcasting from the nearby American Tower on Penobscot Knob supporting the WNEP-DT antenna as well as WOLF-TV/DT's antenna.[28][29]\n As the WNEP-TV analog broadcast tower collapsed on December 16, 2007, one of the falling guy wires supporting the WNEP-TV tower damaged the neighboring tower broadcasting WVIA-TV (analog and digital) and WVIA-FM by shearing off the top section of the WVIA tower supporting the antenna for the analog and digital TV signals. The antenna for WVIA-FM remained intact, as it is located on the lower section of the shared WVIA-FM-TV tower.  The WVIA-TV analog signal on channel 44 was temporarily put off the air until service was restored through a back-up tower on Penobscot Knob.[30] The collapse of WNEP-TV's analog tower also severed power to the transmitters for CBS affiliate WYOU (channel 22) and NBC affiliate WBRE-TV (channel 28), putting those stations off the air for a time.[31]\n On June 12, 2009, WNEP was to operate on a new tower which is currently complete, though the antenna had not arrived in a timely fashion. Their goal was to have the new facility operating by August 2009, but it was delayed a few months.[32]  On December 5, 2009, WNEP turned off channel 49 and moved to channel 50. Moving to channel 50 was necessary so it can alleviate possible interference from Telemundo O&O WWSI which currently operates out of Atlantic City, New Jersey on UHF channel 49.[33]\n On February 15, 2010, the channel 49 facility was put back into use by WNEP on a temporary basis with FCC approval to accommodate WVIA-TV, which had suffered a partial tower collapse and electrical fire which had destroyed WVIA's transmitter building and the equipment within.[34][35]\n On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2014which has operated Fox affiliate WOLF-TV (channel 56), CW affiliate WSWB (channel 38) and MyNetworkTV affiliate WQMY (channel 53) since October 2014\u2014entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. The complicated SSA relationships that Sinclair has in the Scranton\u2013Wilkes\u2013Barre market with WOLF, WSWB and WQMY \u2013 the former two of which are currently the only legal television duopoly in the market \u2013 created an ownership entanglement, as WNEP and WOLF rank among the market's four highest-rated stations, and the market has too few independently owned full-power stations to permit a second legal duopoly in any event. (Sinclair CEO Christopher Ripley cited Scranton\u2013Wilkes\u2013Barre as one of three markets, out of fourteen where ownership conflicts exist between the two groups, where the proposed acquisition would likely result in divestitures).[36][37][38][39][40][41] To alleviate some of the regulatory issues that the deal incurred by selling certain stations to both independent and affiliated third-party companies, on April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that it would sell the non-license assets of WOLF-TV, WQMY, and WSWB and the full assets of eight other stations \u2013 Sinclair-operated KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, WRLH-TV in Richmond, KDSM-TV in Des Moines and WXLV-TV in Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point, and Tribune-owned WPMT in Harrisburg and WXMI in Grand Rapids \u2013 to Standard Media Group (an independent broadcast holding company formed by private equity firm Standard General to assume ownership of and absolve ownership conflicts involving the aforementioned stations) for $441.1 million. Sinclair concurrently exercised its option to buy WOLF-TV and WQMY to allow Standard Media Group \u2013 the latter of which, for regulatory purposes, would have continued to be licensed as a satellite of WOLF-TV \u2013 to acquire the stations outright; Standard would concurrently acquire the WOLF-TV license, which is permitted under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership regulations as WSWB is not ranked as one of the top-four stations in the market.[42][43][44][45][46]\n On July 18, 2018, the FCC voted to have the Sinclair\u2013Tribune acquisition reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties.[47][48][49][50][51][52] Three weeks later on August 9, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell.[53][54][55][56][57][58]\n On December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group\u2014which has owned NBC affiliate WBRE-TV since 1997 and operated CBS affiliate WYOU-TV since 1996 (running the latter through a shared services agreement with Mission Broadcasting since 1998 after selling the license to acquire WBRE through a grandfathered LMA)\u2014announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar is precluded from acquiring WNEP directly or indirectly, as FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market. (Furthermore, any attempt by Nexstar to assume the operations of WNEP through local marketing or shared services agreements may be subject to regulatory hurdles that could delay completion of the FCC and Justice Department's review and approval process for the acquisition.) As such, Nexstar will be required to sell either WNEP or both WBRE and WYOU (separately as it would break the grandfathered LMA) to separate, unrelated companies to address the ownership conflict. On January 31, 2019, Nexstar announced that WNEP, along with WTKR in Norfolk, Virginia and WGNT in Portsmouth, Virginia would be sold to independent third parties in order to address ownership conflicts involving existing Nexstar properties in both markets.[59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][1][2] On March 20, 2019, McLean, Virginia-based Tegna Inc. announced it would purchase WNEP from Nexstar upon consummation of the merger, as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Tegna and the E. W. Scripps Company in separate deals worth $1.32 billion; along with Harrisburg sister station WPMT (which will also be acquired by Tegna as part of the spin-offs), this would make WNEP among the first television properties in Pennsylvania for Tegna.[3][68]\n The station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n The station became a charter affiliate of Antenna TV upon its launch on January 1, 2011, The network is carried on digital subchannel 16.2, replacing RTV on that subchannel.[70]\n WNEP-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 16, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49.[71] Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 16.\n WNEP serves one of the largest coverage areas east of the Mississippi River. This area is very mountainous meaning that some areas cannot get a clear signal from channel 50. As a result, it operates one of the largest translator systems of any station in the Eastern Time Zone. WNEP-TV is also one of very few television stations that operates the entire translator system in digital.\n Many of the programs air on WNEP have been in-house productions rather than syndicated shows. The most popular of these was a children's program called The Land of Hatchy Milatchy.[72][73] One of the hosts during its long run, Miss Judy (who replaced original host Nancy Berg in the 1960s), would tell children where to find their birthday gift live on the air. The show was used as the basis for an episode of the TV series The Office. In the Office episode, as a child Michael Scott was on a show called Fundle Bundle. It was the 18th episode of the second season and was written by Mindy Kaling. In Fundle Bundle, Miss Judy was called Miss Trudy.\n Another program, Uncle Ted's Ghoul School, once employed Bill O'Reilly as a writer. He was also a reporter at the station for a brief period during the mid-1970s. WNEP also served as the local affiliate for the Bowling for Dollars and Dialing for Dollars formats, producing local versions of each.\n Today, WNEP produces two in-house programs: Pennsylvania Outdoor Life, a show about hunting and fishing in Pennsylvania, and Home & Backyard, a show about do-it-yourself home improvements, cooking and gardening. Pennsylvania Outdoor Life airs Sundays at 6:30\u00a0p.m. and Home & Backyard airs Saturdays at 9:00\u00a0a.m. on WNEP. The station also participates in several local charity events, including the MDA Labor Day Telethon and Scranton's annual Santa Parade.\n WNEP-TV presently broadcasts 41 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6\u00bd hours on weekdays, 4\u00bd hours on Saturdays and 4 hours on Sundays).\n The station is best known for its local newscasts which are among the highest rated in the United States.[74] It runs their newscasts under the branding of Newswatch 16. WNEP has led the ratings in northeastern Pennsylvania for most of the last 30 years and according to Nielsen data attracts more viewers than the other stations in town combined. In 2000, the weekday morning program earned shares between 50 and 60 meaning that 50 to 60% of televisions in the market were tuned to this station. Their on-air personalities are well known in the area. Chief Meteorologist Tom Clark had been with the station since 1981 and was one of the region's most popular broadcasters. He retired, and his final broadcast was on December 31, 2016. His wife Noreen, who was a meteorologist for the weekend news, had been with the station since 1982. She retired in April 2018. Marisa Burke, a native of nearby Danville, had been with the station since 1984 and solo anchored the noon news and co-anchored the weeknight 6 o'clock newscast with Scott Schaffer. She retired from WNEP on October 28, 2016.[75] Fox requested most of its affiliates to air local news in 1990. To satisfy this, WNEP began producing a nightly 10 o'clock newscast on the area's affiliate WOLF-TV (then channel 38) in 1991. In November 2009, after being unable to reach an agreement with WNEP on a contract extension, WOLF announced its intention to turn to WBRE to produce an hour-long 10\u00a0p.m. newscast beginning January 1, 2010. WNEP then announced that it would begin a 10:00\u00a0p.m. newscast on its sister station WNEP2 on the same date.\n Known as Newswatch 16 at 10 on Fox 38, it was the first instance of one station producing a newscast for another.[citation needed] When the Fox affiliation moved from channel 38 to channel 56, the 10 o'clock news switched stations as well. It then became known as Fox 56 News at 10 with a secondary title of Newswatch 16 at 10 on Fox 56. WNEP airs this broadcast from a secondary set at its studios. The station runs a secondary service, known as \"WNEP 2\" (formerly \"Newswatch 16 Anytime\" and before that \"Newswatch 16 on Adelphia 63\"), on its second digital subchannel and area cable systems. This channel currently airs Antenna TV programming along with other local programming. WNEP was the only media outlet in the market to utilize a helicopter, known as \"Skycam 16\", for news gathering purposes. The helicopter was operational from 1984 until being decommissioned in February 2009.[76] The station airs the Pennsylvania Lottery televised nighttime drawings live seven nights a week, Mega Millions drawing Tuesdays and Fridays, and the live Powerball drawing on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n In March 2009, its weekday morning news at 6 added another two hours (7\u20139 a.m.) seen on WNEP 2. Also in March, the station started up-converting its news programs to 720p widescreen format becoming the first one in the area to make such a change. WNEP announced on August 6, 2009 that they would begin broadcasting a 4:00\u00a0p.m. newscast on September 8, known as Newswatch 16 at 4.\n On February 10, 2011, starting with the 4\u00a0p.m. newscast, WNEP premiered a new HD-ready set (newscasts remained in widescreen standard definition). On July 9, 2011, WNEP began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition starting with the 6\u00a0p.m. newscast, becoming the first station in the Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre market to begin offering local newscasts in high definition. In early September 2011, WNEP expanded its 4\u00a0pm newscast to a full hour with an additional half-hour at 4:30\u00a0p.m.\n Since 1994, the station has used an updated version of Al Ham's \"Move Closer to Your World\", which is composed by Cliff Schwarz. From 1979 to 1994, the station used the original theme, which is currently used by ABC O&O WPVI-TV in Philadelphia.\n A live interview by WNEP reporter Sofia Ojeda on August 1, 2014 at the Wayne County Fair made a social-media sensation of 5-year-old Noah Ritter.[77] WNEP's video was later \"songified\" by The Gregory Brothers into the song \"Apparently.\"[78]\n John Oliver from HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver mentioned the conflict of viewers over the station's scale model train set in the background of its weather deck and garden (including 'agree/disagree' comments on the station's viewer comment line), resulting in the show building a larger-scale train set for the station with the landmarks of Scranton and the surrounding area exaggerated. Though the station accepted it, it proved to be too large for the weather deck/garden, and was donated to Scranton's Electric City Trolley Museum for display beginning in late September 2017, with some modifications (including its tunnel now being presented as John Oliver's mouth wide open rather than that of area native P.J. Carlesimo).[79]\n In Pennsylvania, WNEP is on cable in State College (Altoona\u2013Johnstown DMA). It is carried in parts of Pike County (New York City DMA) as far east as Matamoras.\n WNEP was carried for many years on the two cable providers in the Lehigh Valley until it was declared part of the Philadelphia (WPVI) market in January 2013. From then on both Service Electric and RCN decided to drop WNEP due to the inability to broadcast duplicate programming from two ABC affiliates. Many viewers in the Lehigh Valley now rely on an over-the-air signal from WNEP-TV's Allentown translator.\n In New York, it is carried in the Highland Lake area of Sullivan County (New York City DMA), alongside WBRE and WYOU.\n", " I'll Go to Bed at Noon (2004), is a book by author Gerard Woodward. It was shortlisted for Booker Prize (2004). \n Set in the north London suburb of Palmers Green in the 1970s, the story opens with Colette Jones attending the funeral of her elder brother's wife, followed by her failed attempts to save him from excessive drinking. Alcoholism also destroys the life of Colette's son, a talented pianist, whom she tries to exile from her house. \n The title was inspired by the William Shakespeare play King Lear. \"And I'll go to bed at noon\" is the last line spoken by the Fool.\n \n", " Robert Montague Noel (born 12 June 1964) is a British businessman, the chief executive (CEO) of Land Securities, the largest commercial property company in the UK.[2]\n He is the eldest son of Henry Methuen Noel Noel (1927\u20131998), an Army officer and a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries, and Helen Elizabeth Anne Hutchinson.[3] Noel was educated at Marlborough College.[1] He went on to study at Reading University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1986.[4] is a qualified chartered surveyor.[1]\n On 31 March 2012, Francis Salway was succeeded as chief executive of Land Securities by Noel. Noel had been managing director of the company's London properties, having joined Land Securities in January 2010 from Great Portland Estates plc, where he had been property director since 2002.[5]\n Noel has had other roles as chairman of the Westminster Property Association, a Director of The New West End Company and a trustee and director of the charity LandAid.[6]\n Noel and his French wife Sophie have a son and two daughters, and own homes in London and Frinton-on-Sea, Essex.[7] Noel has a tattoo on his bottom (believed to be an elephant), obtained in Thailand in his youth.[7]\n", " \nCynan Jones (born 1975) is a British writer from Wales, UK, who lives and works in Ceredigion.[1] Jones published his first novel, The Long Dry, in 2006. In 2010 he published Le Cose Che Non Vogliamo Pi\u00f9 (Things We Don't Want Anymore) in Italian. He later published three novels between 2011 and 2014. In autumn 2016, Cove became his sixth published work. His work has been translated into other languages, and his short stories have appeared in a number of anthologies and publications like Granta and New Welsh Review. The story A Glass of Cold Water aired on BBC Radio 4 in May 2014.[1][2]\n Jones has been noted as an author and received some awards. In October 2017, he won the \u00a315,000 BBC National Short Story Award for The Edge of the Shoal.[3]\n Jones was born near Aberaeron, Ceredigion. The Long Dry, his first novel, was awarded a 2007 Betty Trask Award.[4] In 2008, the author himself was named as the Hay Festival Scritture Giovani. A chapter from The Dig, first published in Granta Magazine, was shortlisted for the 2013 Sunday Times EFG Private Bank Short Story Award.[5] The Dig, his most recent novel, won a 2014 Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Prize and the 2015 Wales Book of the Year Fiction Prize. That novel was also on the longlist for the 2014 Kirkus Prize in the US and the 2014 Warwick Prize for Writing.\n In an interview with Cynan Jones about The Dig, the author spoke about \"triggering reactions [in the reader], without being overtly shocking.\"[6] He also explained his use of more poetic language for some characters over others to keep them apart or \"mirror\" an aspect of their character. In using \"physical and natural allegories\" to say things about people, the reader should \"understand the reference instinctively.\"[6] He mentioned writing like \"Steinbeck, for example, with The Long Dry\".[6]\n In another interview, Jones addressed the idea that there is \"a natural allegory in the center of [his books] that really informs the human situation\".[7] He says to \"trust the readers\" so that you can do or say things that will \"draw the reader's eye\" and you don't have to \"build narratives\" that are more like \"writing by numbers\".[7] When asked about \"the saccharine and the violent\" that a lot of literature avoids, Jones said that he trusts the reader to have an understanding of the \"innate\" nature of a situation and all he has to do is \"write it down as clearly as I can, and without judgement\", more like a witness than a voyeur.[8]\n In 2014, Jones made headlines for not punctuating most of the speech in his novel The Dig (and a few other short stories). His characters' speech and ideas had been delineated through quotation marks (inverted commas) until John Freeman, an editor at the magazine Granta, took a chance and removed the speech marks to be \"more immediate, more with it\". The author agreed on the impact of this unconventional device and finished the rest of the book this way, save for one conversation between the protagonist and his mother. In that passage, Jones used traditional speech marks \"to create a sense of a more conventional, staid dialogue.\" Writers like Cormac McCarthy, James Joyce, and Samuel Beckett have experimented with this same lack of punctuation. By doing so, Jones went against a convention that has predominated since at least the late 18th century.[9]\n", " The Darley Stakes is a Group 3 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile and 1 furlong (1,811 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in October.\n The event was established in 1987, but the inaugural running was abandoned because of high winds and structural damage.[1] For a period the race held Listed status, and it was promoted to Group 3 level in 2003.\n The Darley Stakes was formerly staged during Newmarket's Champions' Meeting in mid-October.

Common names include prairie milkweed, Sullivant's milkweed, and smooth milkweed.[1][2] It is native to North America, where it occurs in the central United States and Ontario in Canada.[3]\n This is a perennial herb growing from deep rhizomes. The stem is 40 centimeters to just over one meter tall. The ovate, pointed  leaves are oppositely arranged. The blades have wavy margins, reddish midveins, and hairless undersides. They curve up on the stem. Pale to deep pinkish purple flowers are borne in rounded clusters from the leaf axils. The fruit is a greenish follicle. The flowers are insect-pollinated, but the plant often reproduces vegetatively via the rhizome.[3]\n This species is very similar to Asclepias syriaca, the common milkweed, and the two easily hybridize. Common milkweed can be distinguished by several characters. Its blunt-tipped leaf blades have a coating of hairs on the undersides and are straight on the stem, not curving up. The flowers are smaller and more numerous, and the surface of the follicle is rougher.[3]\n The native habitat of the plant includes prairie and meadows.[2] It grows in moist areas, such as river bottomland.[1]\n Insects that take nectar from the plant include bumblebees and other bees, wasps, ants, flies, and  butterflies. The caterpillars of the monarch butterfly feed on the foliage. The larva of the milkweed leaf-miner (Liriomyza asclepiades) mine the leaves. Aphids that can be found on the plant include the yellow milkweed aphid (Aphis nerii), black aphid (Aphis rumicis), and the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae).[4]\n The ruby-throated hummingbird takes nectar.[4]\n Most Asclepias are toxic if consumed in large quantities due to cardiac glycoside content.[2]\n", " Samuel R.

The Shanti Pal group emerged as through a split in the North Bengal-Bihar Regional Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), being the pro-Lin Biao faction.[1] The leader of the faction, Shanti Pal, had been a school teacher in Phansidewa who became a key CPI(ML) leader.[2] After forming his own faction Pal remained loyal to the line of the CPI(ML) leader Charu Majumdar.[2] Pal's party combatted landlords in areas like Godda and Sahebganj.[3] The party opposes participation in elections and calls for armed agrarian revolution.[4][5]\n As of 1981 COC, CPI(ML) Shanti Pal had influence in Bhawanipur, Rupauli, Dhamdaha and Barhatta blocks of Purnea district and parts of Katihar district.[6] On March 9, 1993 COC, CPI(ML) Shanti Pal militants killed nine people in Amjhora village, Banka District.[7] As of 2006 the leader of Shanti Pal group in Madhepura was in jail, sentenced for the killing of a mukhya.[8]\n", " \n Marco Jay Luciano \"Mark\" Occhilupo (born 12 February 1966) is an Australian surfer and winner of the 1999 ASP World title.[1]\n Occhilupo, also known as Occy, began his professional career in the World Championship Tour (WCT) at the age of 17.\n Occhilupo was born on 16 June 1966 in Kurnell, New South Wales, Occhilupo's father was Italian and his mother was originally from New Zealand. Marco began surfing at the age of nine. He soon progressed to neighboring Cronulla.\n He won his first amateur Schoolboys contest at 13 and followed up with two Cadet State Titles. After the 10th grade, he left home as an ASP trialist. Virtually unnoticed, he sneaked into the Top 16 at year's end, securing a seed for the following year.\n In 1984, Occy shot to the top of the ASP ratings as a cocky 17-year-old and set performance standards over the next few years that still haven't been matched. At Jeffreys Bay, his power and aggression turned backhand surfing into an advantage.\n Even in America, where Tom Curren had become somewhat of a surfing deity, Occy was adored. In surfing's biggest spectator event, the Op Pro, the two engaged in a rivalry.[2] With aspirations in the acting field, Occy played himself in the 1987 Hollywood Cult-Classic, North Shore. Professional surfing was peaking, and Curren and Occy were the superheroes, delivering the surf industry unprecedented wealth. He hovered around the top five in the ratings, but some unfortunate influences steered him from a world title that many felt he deserved.\n However, the popular surfer struggled with depression.  Years on the tour burned him out. He lost focus; he lost his desire to surf. The young, aggressive surfer faded away from the '80s spotlight and into a subdued existence. Then, in 1988, his life started to unravel. From a simple and busy existence of vegetarianism, yoga, and competition, he began to indulge in activities that he had avoided in his early life because he hadn't had time to be a rascal teenager. Indulging in drug and alcohol use, partying, and showing disregard for his gift became the object of his life. A touchy subject still to this day, Occy basically lived the young Aussie surfer's lifestyle typical of the time. Burned out on the tour, he threw a quarterfinal heat at the Op and headed home to Cronulla. At that point, he struggled with motivation and his ever-fluctuating weight. He quit the World Tour in the early 1990s.\n Over the next several years, he made a couple of half-hearted comeback attempts and remained in the public eye as a repeating star of Jack McCoy's Billabong videos. Married in 1993 to Beatrice Ballardie, he built a house near Kirra, sat on the couch, and basically didn't get up for more than a year. From his 111-kilo peak, he began a training program under McCoy in Western Australia that helped him shed 34 kilos and regain his form.\n As the years passed, the time away gave Occhilupo a clearer vision of his goal: to dominate the world circuit by making an incredible comeback. In 1995, he re-entered the surfing arena, proving he could still capture a title. With some major wins under his comeback belt, Occhilupo stunned the surfing world by capturing the world title in 1999 at the age of 33. From his home in Bilambil Heights, New South Wales, where he lived with Beatrice and stepson Rainer, Occy's long overdue reign had finally begun.\n With well over 20 years of competition under his belt, 2005 saw him contemplate retirement; but after a solid year wherein he was recognised as putting on arguably the best backside performance ever seen at Jeffreys Bay and with an immense amount of fan support, Occy changed his plans and is back to give the youngsters (who are literally half his age) plenty of stick. It is widely known in surfing circles that the main reason Mark retired was due to the fact his board shaper, Brad 'bonza' Harvey, took up a career in sprinkler fitting.

Prints were very popular in central Europe in the early 20th century\u2014Vladimir Nabokov observed in his novel Despair that they could be \"found in every Berlin home\".[1]\n B\u00f6cklin produced several different versions of the mysterious painting between 1880 and 1901.\n All versions of Isle of the Dead depict a desolate and rocky islet seen across an expanse of dark water. A small rowboat is just arriving at a water gate and seawall on shore.[2] An oarsman maneuvers the boat from the stern. In the bow, facing the gate, is a standing figure clad entirely in white. Just behind the figure is a white, festooned object commonly interpreted as a coffin. The tiny islet is dominated by a dense grove of tall, dark cypress trees\u2014associated by long-standing tradition with cemeteries and mourning\u2014which is closely hemmed in by precipitous cliffs. Furthering the funerary theme are what appear to be sepulchral portals and windows on the rock faces.\n B\u00f6cklin himself provided no public explanation as to the meaning of the painting, though he did describe it as \u201ca dream picture: it must produce such a stillness that one would be awed by a knock on the door.\u201d[3][4] The title, which was conferred upon it by the art dealer Fritz Gurlitt in 1883, was not specified by B\u00f6cklin, though it does derive from a phrase in an 1880 letter he sent to the painting\u2019s original commissioner.[5] Not knowing the history of the early versions of the painting (see below), many observers have interpreted the oarsman as representing the boatman Charon who ferried souls to the underworld in Greek mythology. The water would then be either the River Styx or the River Acheron and his white-clad passenger a recently deceased soul transiting to the afterlife.\n Isle of the Dead evokes, in part, the English Cemetery in Florence, Italy, where the first three versions were painted. The cemetery was close to B\u00f6cklin's studio and was also where his infant daughter Maria was buried. (In all, B\u00f6cklin lost 8 of his 14 children).\n The model for the rocky islet was perhaps Pontikonisi, a small, lush island near Corfu which is adorned with a small chapel amid a cypress grove,[6] perhaps in combination with the mysterious rocky island of Strombolicchio near the famous volcano Stromboli, Sicily. (Another less likely candidate is the island of Ponza in the Tyrrhenian Sea.)\n Michael Webber states that it was painted in the Bay of Kotor in Montenegro, and that it inspired the composer Rachmaninoff.[7] This claim is supported by the similarity between the painting and the island of St. George near Perast, which is lined by cypress groves and houses a church dedicated to Saint George.\n B\u00f6cklin completed the first version of the painting in May 1880 for his patron Alexander G\u00fcnther, but kept it himself. In April 1880, while the painting was in progress, B\u00f6cklin's Florence studio had been visited by Marie Berna, n\u00e9e Christ (widow of financier Dr. Georg von Berna [1836\u201365] and soon-to-be wife of the German politician Waldemar, Count of Oriola [1854\u20131910]). She was struck by the first version of this \"dream image\" (now in the Kunstmuseum Basel), which sat half completed on the easel, so B\u00f6cklin painted a smaller version on wood for her (now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York City). At Berna's request, he added the coffin and female figure, in allusion to her husband's death of diphtheria years earlier. Subsequently, he added these elements to the earlier painting. He called these works Die Gr\u00e4berinsel (\"Tomb Island\").[8] (Sometimes the \"Basel\" version is credited as the first one, sometimes the \"New York\".) It was acquired by the Gottfried Keller-Stiftung in 1920.[9]\n The third version was painted in 1883 for B\u00f6cklin\u2019s dealer Fritz Gurlitt. Beginning with this version, one of the burial chambers in the rocks on the right bears B\u00f6cklin's own initials: \"A.B.\". (In 1933, this version was put up for sale and a noted B\u00f6cklin admirer, Adolf Hitler, acquired it. He hung it first at the Berghof in Obersalzberg and, then after 1940, in the New Reich Chancellery in Berlin. It is now at the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin.)\n Financial imperatives resulted in a fourth version in 1884, which was ultimately acquired by the entrepreneur and art collector Baron Heinrich Thyssen and hung at his Berliner Bank subsidiary. It was burned after a bomb attack during World War II and survives only as a black-and-white photograph.\n \nA fifth version was commissioned in 1886 by the Museum of Fine Arts, Leipzig, where it still hangs. In 1888, B\u00f6cklin created a painting called Die Lebensinsel (\"Isle of Life\"). Probably intended as an antipole to the Isle of the Dead, it also shows a small island, but with all signs of joy and life. Together with the first version of the Isle of the Dead, this painting is part of the collection of the Kunstmuseum Basel.\n In 1901 a final version by Arnold B\u00f6cklin and his son Carlo B\u00f6cklin was made and is on display in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n Theatre\n Film\n \nTelevision\n [1]\n[2]\n", " \n The Stamford station, officially known as the Stewart B. McKinney Transportation Center[3] or the Stamford Transportation Center, is a major railroad station in the city of Stamford, Connecticut, serving passengers traveling on Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, and Shore Line East. In addition, it is also a major bus terminal for Greyhound, Peter Pan, and CTtransit buses. Annual ridership on Metro-North exceeded 8.4 million in 2016, making it the second busiest station in the entire system, after Grand Central Terminal.[4]\n Just northeast of the station is the split for the New Canaan Branch. A few Shore Line East trains terminate at Stamford during the morning rush hour, and originate there in the evening.\n United Airlines codeshares with Amtrak to provide service out of Stamford station to the train station at United's Northeast hub, Newark Liberty International Airport. As such, the train station has the IATA airport code (as an IATA-indexed train station) ZTF.\n Downtown Stamford is directly north of the station, while the South End is directly south.\n Regular daily train service began in Stamford on January 1, 1849. In 1867, a depot was built one block east of the present location. The railroad at that time consisted of two tracks and passed through town on ground level (crossing the streets at grade). In the mid-1890s two more tracks were added to the line and most crossings were elevated and bridged, so the 1867 depot, was razed and replaced.[5]\n In 1987, the New York Times published a review of the then-new Stamford Transportation Center by architecture critic Paul Goldberger. The station was criticized for \"a harshness almost unequaled in contemporary architecture\" as well as for cost overruns and many functional failings, including the lack of shelter for the track platforms. The route from the cross-tracks waiting room to the platform was so long and indirect that passengers who waited indoors until a train's arrival was announced could not get to the platform in time to board it.[6]\n A complete renovation of the station in the early 2000s, provided for in the original design of the overhead structure, addressed these problems. The two platforms were made island platforms, capable of serving four tracks. Added features included platform canopies, stairs and escalators directly from the waiting room for the tracks, and a new platform crossover, connecting to the parking garage.\n This station has two a 9-car-long side platform on the south side, a 10-car-long platform on the north side and two high-level 12-car-long island platforms.[7]:20 The main station concourse straddles the tracks of the Northeast Corridor, and contains the ticket booth, a passenger waiting area, and shops. Below the platform level is an MTA police station, other shops, a Greyhound/Peter Pan office and CT Transit Customer Information Center. Stairs and escalators lead to the platform level. On the south side of the station, across an access street, is a large parking garage connected to the concourse by one pedestrian bridge and directly connected to the east end of the platforms by a second bridge (both bridges connect to Level 4 of the garage).\n A bus station is located just to the north of the train station, underneath a large bridge carrying Interstate 95. Taxis, often lined up by the dozens, pick up passengers at a stand on the south side of the station. A car rental agency is located southwest of the station building.\n Multiple parking garages are within the area, including a garage that is open 24/7 and is linked by air-bridge to the upper level of the train station.\n In 2012 it was announced by the Connecticut Dept of Transportation that the old parking garage would be demolished. An RFP was issued [1] seeking developers' ideas for what to construct on the site of the old garage with the possibility that replacement parking (for 1000 spaces) would be moved to a quarter mile from the rail station.\n Harbor Point Gateway Garage, at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and West Henry Street, provides indoor parking near the station. The facility includes an electric vehicle charging station as well as a car wash/detail service. A pedestrian bridge over Washington Boulevard provides direct access to the train platform from the garage.\n The number of people taking Metro-North to Stamford doubled from 2,155 in 1996 to 4,226 in 2006. In recent years, additional office space has been built near the train station to allow commuters to avoid Interstate 95, which is typically very congested during rush hour. For example, The Royal Bank of Scotland completed a $400 million office building in 2008 within 200 yards of the station.[8]\n Stamford is the busiest Metro-North Railroad station outside of New York City, with the only busier station being Grand Central Terminal. As of 2016, average weekday commuter ridership for the center was 30,000 passengers, ranking among the busiest in the metropolitan area.[citation needed]\n The station, along with the downtown Greenwich railroad station, is receiving increasing numbers of \"reverse commuters\" who work in Stamford but live in New York City. Reverse commuting has doubled from 1997 to 2007 and increased 150 percent since 1990, with 1,900 reverse commuters as of 2007. Younger employees, often single and with enough money to live in Manhattan, for instance, sometimes prefer to live there, although more housing and nightlife have come to Downtown Stamford in recent years. Metro-North has added trains and express service to serve these commuters. As financial companies move to Stamford from Manhattan, some employees often become reverse commuters. Larger companies that are farther away than a few minutes walk from the station routinely provide shuttle service for their workers.[9]\n Stamford receives very frequent rail service on the New Haven Line. During peak hours, trains at Stamford come in intervals as little as three or seven minutes apart.[10] Reverse commute trains during rush hours also operate relatively frequently, at intervals of ten to twenty minutes.[10] Off-peak trains in both directions arrive at Stamford every thirty to forty minutes, but usually within a half-hour of each other.[10]\n As of 2014, Stamford has been a central stop for a special \"Yankee Clipper\" Train. The direct train runs to and from all weeknight and weekend games to Yankees\u2013East 153rd Street to serve New York Yankees baseball games and New York City FC soccer matches at Yankee Stadium. The trains are timed to arrive between 45 minutes and 2 hours prior to the start of the game, and depart between 20 and 45 minutes after they end.[11]\n Due to ridership growth in recent years, eastern Connecticut rail service provider Shore Line East announced on March 19, 2007 that it would extend more of its trains to Stamford during peak hours.[12] To coincide with the extension of this service, Metro-North added another five trains on the New Haven Line to cope with the increases in passenger demand at Stamford.[12]\n Amtrak also runs three routes which stop at Stamford: the Acela Express, the only high-speed rail service in the United States, the Northeast Regional, providing local service along the Northeast Corridor, on which Stamford is a vital station, and the Vermonter, the only train from Connecticut that goes to Vermont. Stamford is now the second-busiest Amtrak station in Connecticut, after New Haven's Union Station.[2]\n", " Vanessa Grenier (born April 15, 1992) is a Canadian former competitive pair skater.

He makes it a  rule to first say \"No\" to every proposal, however alluring, thus gaining time to think it over.[5]\n One of the early arrivals in the Klondike, he purchased either half[1][7] or all[2][4] of Claim 30 on Eldorado Creek from a Russian named Zarnosky or Zarnowsky for a sack of flour and a side of bacon. That claim proved to be one of the richest of the Klondike,[4] yielding $5000 a day.[2] McDonald's slowness of speech hid a shrewdness and business acumen that enabled him to amass a tremendous fortune, somewhere between seven and twenty-seven million dollars.[1] Rather than just work that single piece of land, he leased it to two other miners, who did the actual work for half of the proceeds.[4][8] In the first 45 days, that amounted to $30,000.[8] He then proceeded to buy up other claims and by the end of the year he had acquired 28.[1] By 1898, he had interests in 75 mines,[1] making him the largest landowner and employer in the area.[4]\n That year, when the local Catholic church burned down, he donated $30,000, more than enough to pay for its rebuilding.[1][4] When Father William Judge started building St. Mary's Hospital, McDonald once again made a large donation. In the winter of 1898\u20131899, he toured Europe,[9] finding time to marry, in London, Margaret Chisholm, the twenty-year-old daughter of the superintendent of the Thames Water Police, and to be received by Pope Leo XIII, who made him a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory in appreciation of his generosity.[4][10]\n However, though the gold rush eventually died down, McDonald continued to buy land claims, now mostly worthless, squandering his money. Living alone in a cabin on Clearwater Creek, he died of a heart attack in 1909.[1] His remaining assets of $30,000 did not cover his debts.[1] His widow benefited from a life insurance policy urged upon him by another Klondike tycoon, Belinda Mulrooney.[11]\n McDonald's legend was retold in an anonymous poem called \"King of the Klondike\" (ca. 1910).[6]\n His resting place is in the cemetery in Dawson City.[1]\n Further reading\n McGill University Library, Rare Books and Special Collections, McDonald Bonanza (Klondike) Ltd. 1898 [RBSC MSG 789]\u00a0: Includes reports, correspondence, prospectus, and maps of the Alexander McDonald claim in the Klondike.\n", " The Malayalam Wikipedia (Malayalam: \u0d2e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d02 \u0d35\u0d3f\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d3f\u0d2a\u0d40\u0d21\u0d3f\u0d2f) is the Malayalam edition of Wikipedia, a free and publicly editable online encyclopedia, and was launched on December 21, 2002.

In many ways, Hot Streets marked the beginning of a new era for the band, turning to disco music, a move which would be derided in retrospect. This was the band's first album with all-new material released since their second that did not have a numbered title. It was also the first album not to feature original guitarist/vocalist Terry Kath, who died from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound in January 1978. He was replaced by Donnie Dacus on this album.\n Having worked with James William Guercio since their 1969 debut, Chicago decided to part ways with the producer following the release of Chicago XI in 1977.  However, a bigger change for the group was the death of guitarist Terry Kath in January 1978, who unintentionally shot himself at a roadie's house while playing with one of his guns. The members of the band were devastated by his death, and considered breaking up.  Kath was one of the key players who most defined the rhythmic sound of the band.  After the initial shock waned, the group decided that they still had something to offer musically, and carried on.\n Phil Ramone, who had mixed some of their earlier albums, was called upon to co-produce their new effort.  But before Chicago could begin recording, they had to contend with the difficult process of finding a new guitarist.  Accomplished guitarist Donnie Dacus was chosen, bringing his own distinctive style to the group's music.  Prior to joining Chicago, Dacus had worked with both Roger McGuinn and Stephen Stills.\n Recording sessions took place both in Miami and Los Angeles that spring, after years of working at Guercio's Caribou Ranch in Colorado.  By the end of the sessions, the band felt as though they were still in a strong musical position even after the loss of Kath.  Recording the album Spirits Having Flown next door at the same Miami studio, some of the tracks featured  the Bee Gees and their keyboardist, Blue Weaver.  The Gibb brothers added vocals to the song \"Little Miss Lovin'\" while Weaver added synthesized strings to \"No Tell Lover\" and \"Show Me The Way\".  In turn, Chicago's horn section played on Spirits Having Flown, most notably on the hit single \"Too Much Heaven\".\n To mark their new beginning, the band broke with tradition by giving their album a title, rather than a number.  Having chosen the title Hot Streets, the album cover featured a picture of the band (shot by photographer Norman Seeff) rather than just the group logo. Because a later marketing survey noted that consumers expected to see the logo on the cover, Chicago's logo returned in the form of a high-rise building for the follow-up album, Chicago 13.[citation needed]\n The album was released in October 1978, preceded by a release of the lead single \"Alive Again\".  Hot Streets was another hit for the group, who had been concerned that the public might not accept them without Kath. Although the album went platinum, and Chicago scored a second top-twenty hit with \"No Tell Lover\", Hot Streets was the first Chicago album since their debut that failed to reach the US Top 10; fittingly, the band's twelfth album peaked at #12.\n Following the release of Chicago 13 and at the end of the Christmas 1979 tour, Dacus would be released from the group, bringing his short tenure with Chicago to an abrupt end.\n In 2003, Hot Streets was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with an alternate version of Lamm's \"Love Was New\" sung by Dacus as a bonus track.\n Album \u2013 Billboard (North America)\n Singles \u2013 Billboard (North America)\n", " Roberto Alcaide Garcia (born March 22, 1978 in Madrid) is a cyclist from Spain.

Founded by Jeff Sandefer, an entrepreneur and teacher at the University of Texas, AFEE was created to publish entrepreneurship cases and notes and spread entrepreneurship curriculum to schools across the United States. While at UT, Sandefer was ranked one of the top ten entrepreneurship professors in the country by BusinessWeek. In 2002, Sandefer and fellow teachers Phil Siegel, Vaughn Brock and Jack Long left the University of Texas over a dispute about the future of the program. After their final class attracted 130 students, they decided to use the curriculum to launch a free-standing business school and founded the Acton School of Business. Acton graduated its first class in 2004. The school derives its name from Lord Acton, a 19th-century scholar and originator of the famous quote \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\n Using the socratic case method, exercises and business simulations, Acton offers a MBA in entrepreneurship in under a year. Unlike traditional MBA programs, Acton offers only a core curriculum with no additional elective courses. The program's curriculum is divided into three sections, Integrative Courses, Tools Courses and Life of Meaning.\n The school ranks #1 on Princeton Review's 2014 list of \"Most Competitive Students.\"[citation needed] It also ranks #1 on the list of \"Best Administered\".

He was one  of five children born to  Aron Johanson (1856\u20131927) and Rika Ryding Johannsen (1857\u20131940). His education was limited and attained in the public schools of his native country. In 1911 he immigrated to the United States, where he traveled to numerous states, working various odd jobs, arriving in Montana during 1914.  Aronson was married twice, to Matilda Langane and then to Rose McClure.[2]\n In 1915 Aronson filed for a 320-acre (1.3\u00a0km2) homestead in Elk Basin, Montana. He eventually settled in Sunburst, Montana and became established in the oil rigging business.

It was written by staff writer Meg Jackson and directed by Brian Kirk. Nucky attends the Republican National Convention in Chicago, while Eli fills in for him in Atlantic City.\n Nucky visits Chicago for the 1920 Republican National Convention, where he finds himself intrigued by the candidacy of Warren G. Harding over more established candidates. Nucky meets Harding's mistress, Nan Britton, and promises his campaign manager the votes of the New Jersey delegation in exchange for blocking Senator Walter Evans Edge's nomination for the vice-presidency, knowing that his former ally has secretly sided against him in funding new roads for Jersey City rather than Nucky's own Atlantic City.\n Nucky stops by Torrio's brothel to find more information on Harding. As Nucky talks to Torrio and a judge from Ohio, Jimmy comes downstairs and runs into his old patron. Nucky behaves coldly towards Jimmy, criticizing him for never writing his family. It is revealed in the episode that Van Alden, still working out of Atlantic City's post office to investigate Jimmy, has been intercepting the steady stream of money and letters Jimmy sends to Angela. Back home, while collecting money at Nucky's casino, Eli walks into an armed robbery. He is shot and wounded by the D'Alessio gang, who planned the heist with Luciano and Lansky.\n When Nucky learns of Eli's injury, he returns to Torrio's brothel and asks Jimmy to come back to Atlantic City, reminding him that, as an Irishman among Italians, Jimmy will always be an outsider in Torrio's crew. Nucky stresses that he needs Jimmy's help in the intensifying turf war against Rothstein and the Italians. He offers him a percentage share in his smuggling operations and help in dealing with Van Alden's investigation of Jimmy's heist. Jimmy is noncommittal, although later he looks on wistfully as Torrio and his men laugh and joke in Italian.\n Van Alden's wife, desiring a child even though she is infertile, pressures him to provide money for an operation he cannot afford. He gathers all the money he has intercepted from Jimmy, then mails an envelope to his wife. However, it is soon revealed that he has actually passed the money along to Angela; Van Alden's wife breaks down in tears as she reads the letter confirming his decision to trust in God's will rather than get her an operation. Rothstein prepares for legal trouble over his role in Black Sox Scandal. Margaret finds herself entangled in Nucky's affairs when he calls from Chicago and asks her to watch over his office and, without opening them, hide certain documents in the chaotic aftermath of the casino robbery. Margaret spends the entire night sitting at Nucky's desk, reading a ledger that details his profits from bootlegging.\n IGN gave the episode a score of 7.5 describing it as \"a calm before the storm episode, [it] also succeeds at settling Nucky's political ties by establishing new ones, this time tethered to Warren Harding's Presidential campaign. The sky may be the limit on Nucky's political capital, but all he wants are his roads to Atlantic City. And he'll need them, as the war threatens to bring both allies and enemies to Nucky's town.\"[1]\n The A.V.

The eyes are covered by a membrane of skin and have atrophied lens cells enclosed in a vesicle and a retinal layer. It has prominent incisor teeth, which are used for burrowing. The fur is greyish, but can vary in color. It can grow to a size of 31\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) and weigh up to 570\u00a0g (20\u00a0oz). Its dental formula is 1.0.0.31.0.0.3 [3]\n The greater mole-rat is known from the steppes of Ukraine and from southern Russia between the Dnieper and the Volga rivers. Its range extends northwards to the Oryol to Kursk railway line and southwards to the North Caucasus.[4] It favours lowland habitats with black earth, avoiding sandy or loamy soils. It inhabits steppes and forest steppes, agricultural land, plantations, orchards and gardens and can be a pest.[1]\n The greater mole-rat is a fossorial species that stays underground except when dispersing to new territories as juveniles, a period of great vulnerability.  It lives a solitary existence, except during the breeding season. Due to its atrophied eyes it is totally blind. The paws are not modified like the ones of the moles; it digs with its incisor teeth instead.[3]\n It is a herbivore and feeds on the roots of such plants as dandelions, umbellifers, chicory and tree seedlings, approaching them from underneath. It gathers excess food and stores it in its burrow, sometimes as much as 14\u00a0kg (30\u00a0lb) being collected. Breeding takes place once a year with a litter of two to five young being born in March.[1]\n In general the greater mole-rat is a common species, but somewhat patchily distributed.

The album also peaked at number 4 on the Canadian Albums Chart.\n Upon its release, H.F.M. 2 received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 9 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".[32] Slava Kuperstein of HipHopDX noted a marked improvement over Banks' 2006 effort Rotten Apple, stating that \"the execution isn\u2019t as good the second time around, but Banks has reestablished his sound, and made clear that he is still a major force to be reckoned with in the rap game.\"[35] Allmusic writer Dave Jeffries, despite citing a lack of new ideas as one of the album's weaknesses, was also positive about the album: \"At 13 tracks the album feels right-sized, not overstuffed, and Banks himself is in fine form throughout, delivering stone cold and slow punch lines that are as lethal as ever. When it comes to evolution, there\u2019s really none, but even though he\u2019s been here before, veteran fans will appreciate his return.\"[34]\n Giving the album a rating of 7/10, Ben Detrick of Spin stated that \"Lloyd Banks' hunger is not born of starvation, but of an insatiable appetite. On his third solo effort, the G-Unit rapper is a connoisseur of cars, women, and guns, spinning tight spider webs of syllables that are often so patterned that they obscure individual strands. \"Put my Ferrari in park, give 'em a running start,\" Banks growls on \"Payback,\" a sinister track with mentor 50 Cent and a woozy, almost dubstep bass line. But he loves the ladies almost as much as barking threats. On \"So Forgetful,\" an apology to past conquests, Banks muses about \"wet spots on the mattress and champagne splashes\" atop producer Ryan Leslie's 8-bit Atari synths.\"[39] Steve Jones of USA Today was also positive about the album, giving the album 3/4 stars and citing that \"the G-Unit rapper seeks to rekindle the spark of his critically acclaimed 2004 platinum debut by recalling both the title and the potent street vibe. Banks enlists several like-minded rappers \u2014 Pusha T, Styles P, Juelz Santana and Raekwon\u2014 who complement his own grittiness. The same goes for R&B stars Akon and Lloyd as he relies mainly on his signature jaw-breaking punch lines while eschewing a rash of poppish hooks. Banks is well served by his refusal to compromise just for airplay. His Hunger should whet his fans' appetites for even more.\"[40]\n", " \n Arrabidaea chica (Puca panga, Chica, Crajiru, Cricket-vine; Portuguese common name Crajir\u00fa) is a medicinal plant in the Bignoniaceae family, also used for cosmetics.

Blatter's reign oversaw a vast expansion in revenues generated by the FIFA World Cup accompanied by the collapse of the marketing company International Sport and Leisure and numerous allegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the awarding of FIFA tournaments.\n On 2 June 2015, six days after the United States government indicted several current and former FIFA officials and sports marketing companies for bribery and money laundering,[4]  Blatter announced that he would call for elections to choose a new president of FIFA and that he would not stand in these elections, but he also said he would remain in his position until an extraordinary FIFA Congress could be held for his successor to be elected.[5]\nCriminal proceedings were announced against Blatter by the Swiss Attorney General's office on 25 September 2015, regarding \"criminal mismanagement... and misappropriation\".[6][7]\n In October 2015, Blatter and other top FIFA officials were suspended amid the investigation,[8] and in December the independent FIFA Ethics Committee ejected Blatter from office and banned him from taking part in any FIFA activities over the following eight years.[9] On 24 February 2016, a FIFA appeals committee upheld the suspension but reduced it from eight years to six.[10] Issa Hayatou served as the acting President of FIFA until an extraordinary FIFA Congress was held in late February, electing Gianni Infantino as the 9th president of FIFA.[11]\n Blatter was born in Visp in the Swiss canton of Valais with the given name of Josef. He studied in Saint Maurice, before getting a degree in business and economics from the University of Lausanne in 1959. Blatter has had a long and varied career, including posts such as head of public relations for the tourist board of his native canton, as well as general secretary of the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation.\n He was Director of Sports Timing and Relations of Longines S.A., and was involved in the organization of the 1972 and 1976 Olympic Games.[12][13][14]\n From 1975 onwards, Blatter worked at FIFA, first as technical director (1975\u20131981), then general secretary (1981\u20131998), before his election as FIFA president in 1998.[15] He was re-elected as head of FIFA in 2002, and was re-elected unopposed for another four years on 31 May 2007, even though only 66 of 207 FIFA members nominated him.[16]\n Blatter and FIFA have often been dogged by controversy and allegations of corruption.[4][17][18] His tenure has seen controversy over allegations of financial mismanagement and the acceptance of bribes resulting in Qatar's successful 2022 World Cup bid.\n Blatter has attracted criticism from the media, senior football figures and players,[19] due to controversial statements. These include the claim that Latin American countries would applaud John Terry for having an extramarital affair, and that on-field racism could be corrected with a handshake, among others.[20] He also drew criticism at the 2014 FIFA World Cup seeding, when he interrupted a \"one-minute silence\" for former South-African president Nelson Mandela, who died the day before, after eleven seconds. Michael van Praag, the chairman of the Royal Dutch Football Association, called his behavior \"preposterous\" and expressed the hope Blatter would not be reelected in 2015.[21]\n Blatter has been publicly heckled, at the World Cup in Seoul and the Confederations Cup in Frankfurt, both in 2006,[22] in his home town of Visp in 2011,[23] at the 2012 Women's Olympic Football Final Medal Ceremony,[24] and at the opening of Confederations Cup match in 2013.[25] In order to avoid protest, no speeches were given at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[26]\n Sepp Blatter's 1998 election to the presidency of FIFA over UEFA President Lennart Johansson occurred amidst much controversy.[27][28] Blatter's 2002 candidacy has been marked with rumours of financial irregularities and backroom dealings,[29] culminating with direct accusations of bribery, by a third party, made in the British press by Farra Ado, vice-president of the Confederation of African Football and president of the Somali Football Federation, who claimed to have been offered $100,000 to vote for Blatter in 1998.[30]\n In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, after a controversial second-round match between Portugal and the Netherlands, which saw referee Valentin Ivanov issue a record 16 yellow cards and four red cards, Blatter was said to have lambasted the officiating referee, and said that Ivanov should have given himself a yellow card for his poor performance as a referee.[31] He later claimed to regret his words and promised to officially apologise to Ivanov.[32]\n However, this apology was never given, and the referee was removed from further officiating.[32]\n Blatter was criticized in 2007 and 2008 for trying to change European Union employment law regarding the number of foreign players that football clubs could field at any one time. His plans were to set a restriction of five foreign players and having six players from the said team's own nationality. Blatter believed this would help the countries' national sides by having more national players playing in their leagues.\n Blatter has often referred to the English Premier League as one of the major problems in football and used it as an example, due to the influence of foreign players, coaches and owners in the top teams.[33][34][35][36][37]\n It was reported that Blatter had \"cut an unofficial deal with UEFA head Michel Platini\" to ensure Europe would receive the 2018 World Cup, such that if the non-European bids did not withdraw from 2018 \"they will find themselves frozen out and not given any backing by the FIFA High Command, damaging their chances of being serious contenders for the second tournament.\"[39]\n Eleven bids were submitted in March 2009 covering 13 nations. Mexico and Indonesia withdrew. Five of the remaining nine bids\u2014South Korea, Qatar, Japan, Australia and the United States\u2014were only for the 2022 World Cup, while all the others were bidding for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.[40]\n However, since all of the bids for the 2018 World Cup were from European nations, and FIFA's rules dictate that countries belonging to confederations that hosted either of the two preceding tournaments are not eligible to host,[41] the bids of England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium and Spain/Portugal were forced to be for 2018 only.\n The criticism attracted by Blatter's refusal to allow goal-line technology or video replays intensified following the controversial Frank Lampard disallowed goal in the match between England and Germany on 27 June 2010.[42]\n Two days later, Blatter stated that he deplored the \"evident referee mistakes\" in the England v Germany and Mexico v Argentina matches, and apologised to the English Football Association and the Mexican Football Federation (the two organizations directly concerned by the referees' mistakes), acknowledging that Lampard had indeed scored against Germany and that T\u00e9vez's goal against Mexico had been scored from an offside position.\n He added: \"It is obvious that after the experiences so far at this World Cup it would be a nonsense not to re-open the file on goal-line technology. [\u2026] We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high level referees. [\u2026] I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed.\"[43][44]\n In 2011, elections were scheduled for the FIFA presidency, in which Blatter was again the incumbent candidate, running for a fourth consecutive term. The ChangeFIFA organisation, on 29 March 2011, endorsed former Chilean defender and for three years running South American Footballer of the Year El\u00edas Figueroa as candidate for the presidency, urging national federations to nominate him,[45] but, subsequently, Figueroa decided not to accept the nomination, stating that \"in such a short period of time\" he could not develop a case \"worthy of the magnitude and importance of such a distinguished job\"[45]\n The vote took place at the 61st FIFA Congress in Zurich.[46] The only other candidate, Mohammed bin Hammam of Qatar, withdrew from the presidential race on 28 May, just before the vote.[46] Bin Hammam had supported Blatter's 1998 and 2002 presidential campaigns, but admitted that he had fallen out with Blatter over issues within the FIFA Executive Committee.[47] The FIFA ethics committee that investigated bribery claims against Bin Hammam and CONCACAF head Jack Warner announced that Blatter will not face an investigation into claims that he knew of the bribery and did nothing about it, because of a lack of evidence.[48]\n Blatter criticised the International Olympic Committee (IOC), stating FIFA manage their finances \"like a housewife\", after the IOC announced it would look into allegations of corruption against Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football.[49]\n There being no other nominations, Blatter ran unopposed in the ensuing presidential election and was re-elected for a fourth term, with 186 of the 203 votes cast. In his campaign, Blatter had stipulated that, if re-elected in 2011, he would not run again for president.[50][51] Blatter received criticism for not postponing his 2011 election in which his term as FIFA President was extended through 2015, despite the fact that all other candidates for the role had been suspended or withdrew.\n Amidst internal divisions, FIFA's secretary-general Blatter's deputy and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Michel Zen-Ruffinen drew up a 30-page dossier outlining allegations of financial mismanagement within the organisation.[52][53] The dossier alleged that the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner ISL had led to losses of up to $100m under Blatter's management.\n The allegations were backed by Johansson,[54] and the dossier was handed to the Swiss authorities, but they cleared Blatter of any wrongdoing and FIFA had to pay all the costs.[55] An internal investigation within FIFA was halted by Blatter because members of it broke confidentiality agreements.[56] This questionable behaviour led him to remove Zen-Ruffinen from office immediately before the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n In April 2012 the Council of Europe published a report which stated it would be \"difficult to imagine\" that Blatter would have been unaware of \"significant sums\" paid to unnamed FIFA officials by ISSM/ISL in connection with lucrative contracts for World Cup television rights and the subsequent bankruptcy and collapse of ISL in 2001.[57] The Council of Europe report will be considered by over 300 parliamentarians from the 47 Council of Europe member states in Strasbourg.[58]\n Controversy came in the British press when Russia was awarded the 2018 event, with England receiving just two of their \"promised\" votes; this controversy was dismissed by Blatter as the English showing themselves to be \"bad losers\".[59] The awarding of the 2022 games to Qatar was also controversial. The illegality of homosexuality in the nation caused Blatter to joke that \"I would say they [gay fans] should refrain from any sexual activities\",[60] which brought criticism from retired basketball player John Amaechi and gay rights groups.[61]\n On 29 April 2013, FIFA's Ethics Committee concluded its investigation into allegations of illegal payments to FIFA officials from the organisation's former marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL), which went bankrupt in 2001,[62] and published its report.[63]\n FIFA president Sepp Blatter was cleared of any misconduct, but his predecessor, Brazilian Jo\u00e3o Havelange, resigned as FIFA's honorary president[64] over his part in the scandal, since Havelange along with former FIFA Executive Committee members Ricardo Teixeira and Dr. Nicolas Leoz were found to have accepted illegal payments between 1992 and May 2000. A week before FIFA's ethics committee announced its findings, 84-year-old Leoz had resigned from his post as president of the South American Football Confederation, citing \"health reasons\".[65]\n Blatter, in a statement, \"note[d] with satisfaction\" that the report \"confirms that 'President Blatter's conduct could not be classified in any way as misconduct with regard to any ethics rules'.\" He added he has \"no doubt that FIFA, thanks to the governance reform process that [Blatter] proposed now has the mechanisms and means to ensure that such an issue does not happen again\", though admitting that the scandal \"has caused untold damage to the reputation of [FIFA].\"[66]\n In 2015, elections were scheduled for the FIFA presidency, in which Blatter was again the incumbent candidate, running for a fifth consecutive term. Prince Ali bin Hussein was his opponent in the election.\n The vote took place at the 65th FIFA Congress in Z\u00fcrich on 29 May 2015. Neither party received the necessary two-thirds majority of votes from the first round with Blatter receiving 133 to Prince Ali's 73. According to FIFA rules, a second round should have been held for the two candidates, with a simple majority being sufficient for victory. However, before the second round of voting commenced, Prince Ali announced his withdrawal, handing Blatter victory by default.[67]\n On 2 June 2015, FIFA abruptly called a press conference at their Z\u00fcrich headquarters, where Blatter announced that he would resign from the post of FIFA president amid the ongoing corruption scandal.[68][69]\n During the news conference he said: \"My mandate does not appear to be supported by everybody\" and announced an extraordinary congress scheduled \"as soon as possible\" to elect his successor.[70] Blatter announced that he would remain in office until his successor could be elected at the extraordinary congress, likely to be held some time between December 2015 and March 2016.[71] He continued with words: \"While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football\u2014the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe, and love football as much as we all do at FIFA\".[72]\n Subsequently, on 26 June Blatter prompted speculation that he might be preparing to renege on this resignation, when he was quoted as saying that \"I have not resigned, I put my mandate in the hands of an extraordinary congress\". This seemed to contradict his comments from 2 June 2015.[73] He was further quoted as saying that he resigned \"to take away the pressure from FIFA and my employees, including [pressure] from the sponsors\". Reports speculated that it appears that Blatter will step down at the \"extraordinary congress\" though the situation remains vague.[74]\n On 25 September, Swiss investigators announced that they were investigating Blatter in relation to payments made to UEFA president Michel Platini.[75] While Blatter and Platini denied any impropriety around the payments,[76] major FIFA sponsors Coca-Cola, Visa Inc., McDonald's, and Budweiser issued public statements requesting that he resign for the good of FIFA.[77]\n On 8 October 2015 he was suspended from FIFA for 90 days while investigations into payments made to Michel Platini were conducted. FIFA said in a statement: \"The grounds for these decisions are the investigations that are being carried out by the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee.\"[78] On 21 December, FIFA's ethics committee banned both Blatter and Platini from football for eight years.[79] In February 2016, a FIFA appeals committee upheld the suspension but reduced it from eight years to six.[10]\n In November 2017, American soccer star Hope Solo accused Blatter of sexual assault at the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards in 2013. During an interview with the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, Solo stated she \"had Sepp Blatter grab my ass\" just before the two presented an award together to Abby Wambach.[80] She stated she \"was in shock and completely thrown off. I had to quickly pull myself together to present my team-mate with the biggest award of her career and celebrate with her in that moment, so I completely shifted my focus to Abby.\"[81] Blatter's spokesman Thomas Renggli stated \"This allegation is ridiculous.\"[82]\n Blatter has been the recipient of numerous awards, medals, honorary degrees, and citizenships from nation states, sport governing bodies, special interest groups, universities, and cities.[83]\n His honorary degree from De Montfort University was revoked by the institution in October 2015, as it had previously been given in recognition of his ethical conduct.[84]\n Blatter's first wife was Liliane Biner. The couple had a daughter, Corinne,[85] and divorced shortly after. In 1981, Blatter married Barbara K\u00e4ser, the daughter of Helmut K\u00e4ser, Blatter's predecessor as secretary general of FIFA. Their marriage lasted ten years until Barbara died from complications after an operation. In 1995, Blatter began dating Ilona Boguska, a Polish friend of his daughter Corinne, before they separated in 2002.[86]\n Blatter married for a third time on 23 December 2002, to Graziella Bianca, a dolphin trainer who was a friend of his daughter.[87] Their marriage ended in divorce in 2004.[88][89][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Since 2014, he is in a domestic partnership with Linda Barras.\n Blatter was raised as a Catholic.[90][91]\n", " The Greater Ft.

It is part of the Twin Falls, Idaho Micropolitan Statistical Area.\n Castleford was named for an early crossing of Salmon Falls Creek. The ford was so named because of the odd-shaped obelisks of rhyolite near the stream. The ford, used by pioneers in 1849, was also used by the Kelton-Dalles stage route.[4]\n In 1890, Cephas Lilly settled the area that would later become Castleford. He was considered to be an honest, hardworking pioneer by his contemporaries.\n Ferguson Fruit and Land was quick to utilize the fertile farmland, planting acres of apple orchards. The new fruit business revitalized the local economy, bringing in many new settlers. This new influx of settlers led to the official founding of Castleford in 1907. Business there continued to remain prosperous until the Great Depression, at which point Ferguson Fruit and Land became bankrupt and the town was almost abandoned. Later, with the onset of World War II, the government established a Japanese internment camp on the outskirts of the town. ( This is not a true statement.  The internment camp was actually in Hunt, Idaho. There were two Japanese families that lived in Castleford during WWII, they were told to go to the camp, but the Castleford community voiced their objections to the government, and the families were allowed to stay in Castleford.)(I agree with Mr. McCoy.

At some point in the early 20th century it was moved to Bennett Park in Charlotte. In 1968 it was moved again to the present location.[3]\n This bridge is a bowstring truss bridge, patented by bridge designer Squire Whipple in 1841.

Its name Urania refers to the muse of astronomy in Greek mythology.\n Its origins base on a first observatory on the roof of the Zunfthaus zur Meisen. In 1759, so called \u00abAstronomische Kommission\u00bb succeeded from this location for the first time, to define Culminatio solis and thus calculated the exact global location of the city of Zurich. In later years, astronomical observations were done from the Grossm\u00fcnster's southern \"Karl's tower\", followed by scientific observations (not for public use by interested enthusiasts) from the Federal observatory, built 1861/64 for ETH Z\u00fcrich by Gottfried Semper.\n In 1899, the Z\u00fcrich merchant Abraham Weill Einstein initiated the oldest observatory in Switzerland, situated near Werdm\u00fchleplatz (Uraniastrasse). On June 15, 1907, the observatory was given to operational use. Its approximately 51 meter high tower, dominating western end of Zurich's historical Altstadt.[1]\n Urania's refracting telescope is equipped with a Fraunhofer two-lens system of 30\u00a0cm aperture and focal length of 5.05 meters, allowing maximal 600-fold magnification (mostly used 150- to 205-fold magnification).[2] The refractor in the dome area is the center of the imposing tower building: The telescope stands on a pillar, contact-free installed through the center of the building to the foundations of the business house Urania, fitted with anti-vibration installations.[3]\n Its optical telescope measures twelve tons and was designed by Carl Zeiss AG in Jena, Germany, considered as a technical masterpiece. Urania's refractor topped technological history as \"Urania type\".[2] On its centenary anniversary, telescope and dome were fully renewed. The Zeiss telescope, still meeting today's demands, was dismantled in March 2006, and  in Jena fully restored. On April 25, 2007, the telescope was hoisted into the observatory's 51 m high dome, on May 4, 2007, its second opening ceremony was celebrated.\n The observatory offers guided tours \u2013 Moon, Solar System objects, stars, star clusters, interstellar clouds, and galaxies \u2013 and special events for a wide audience, as well as individual tours for schools and groups.[4] Paid public tours can be found on clear weather from Tuesday to Friday, starting at 20:00 (8 pm).[5][6] The central location and the city of Zurich overriding observation tower also provide an unusual view of the city, Lake Zurich and Alps. The Urania house hosts a restaurant and an exclusive Bar, too. At the same time, its location in the middle of the city of Zurich is a serious problem: light pollution allows restricted observations of few galaxies and nebulae. Therefore, observations are limited practically to the moon and planets and bright celestial objects.[7]\n The observatory is, as part of the building ensemble at that area, listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance.[8]\n", " \n Sir Timothy Miles Bindon Rice (born 10 November 1944) is an English author and lyricist.

Speaking at McGill's funeral,[33] Rice told a tale from his days at EMI about trying to rig the results of the London Evening Standard Girl of the Year competition in 1967. As \"glorified office boy\", Rice was writing songs with Lloyd Webber and desperate to find anybody to record one of their songs. Rice and colleagues filled in 5,000 entry forms overnight voting for the contestant who was a singer, and delivered them to McGill, who supervised the competition. Rice said it was \"a disgraceful act of dishonesty on my part... without actually breaking the rules\". As a result, the Standard proclaimed two Girls of the Year and Rice\u2019s choice was signed to EMI where she made her first record. Rice said at the funeral: \"I owe [Angus] an awful lot, which is just one of the reasons why I'm here today.\"\n In addition to adaptations of his theatrical productions, Rice has worked on several original film and television projects:\n \n", " Harold Janeway was a Democratic member of the New Hampshire Senate, representing the 7th District from 2006 to 2010.[1]  He is founder and president at White Mountain Investment, Inc, a director at the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, and a Trustee of Milton Academy.[2]\n \n", " Tokyo Cabinet and Kyoto Cabinet are two libraries of routines for managing key-value databases.

He also served as the High Sheriff of Bristol from 1710 to 1711, and was Mayor of Bristol for the year 1719 to 1720.\n Elton was the eldest son of Abraham Elton (later created the first of the Elton baronets), and his wife Mary Jefferies. His date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 30 June 1679.[1] He married Abigail Bayly, the daughter of Zachary Bayly of Charlcot House, near Westbury, Wiltshire and Northwood Park, near Glastonbury, Somerset, on 14 May 1702.[1][2]\n Elton was a merchant and industrialist, and like his father before him, he served as the High Sheriff of Bristol from 1710\u201311.[1] He invested in slave ships with his brothers, Isaac and Jacob.[3] He was the Master of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1719 and Mayor of Bristol from 1719\u201320, but in 1720, he was made bankrupt during the \"South Sea Bubble\".[2] As soon as he completed his term as Mayor, he left Bristol and travelled to France, and did not return until his father paid off his debts.[4]\n  Elton returned to England by 1724, and stood in the Taunton by-election of 1724 for the Whigs, as an unexpected late entrant.

The petition was rejected by a vote of 151 to 104.[5] He only served Taunton until the general election, in 1727, when his father vacated his seat in Bristol. At the resulting election, Elton paid his Tory opponent \u00a31,000 to withdraw from the election, allowing him to be returned unopposed.[6] In Parliament, he became a member of the gaols committee. Upon his father's death on 9  February 1728, Elton became Sir Abraham Elton, 2nd Baronet, and inherited Clevedon Court.[7] In February 1730 he spoke against the Royal African Company\u2019s petition to be spared the cost of maintaining their forts. He often petitioned government on mercantile issues, amongst them; in 1730 for the removal of duty on soaps and candles, five separate times for the removal of duty on Irish yarn,[1] twice against the introduction of slave duties.[3] He was said to have made a \"bantering speech\" against the proposed Excise Bill of 1733.[1]\n Elton topped the poll in a contest at the 1734 British general election. He continued raising petitions on mercantile issues, and voted with the Opposition in all recorded divisions. He was returned unopposed at the 1741 British general election.[1]\n Elton died on 20 October 1742, leaving three sons and three daughters.

(Slovene: Houston, imamo problem!) is a 2016 internationally co-produced docufiction-mockumentary film by Slovene director \u017diga Virc.[1] The film explores the myth of the secret multibillion-dollar deal behind the United States' purchase of Yugoslavia's clandestine space program in the early 1960s.[2][3] It is based and inspired by numerous real events and facts, in the sense that it is intended as an allegory to the Cold War.[4]\n The film premiered on 16 April 2016 at Tribeca Film Festival. It was selected as the Slovenian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards but it was not nominated.[5][6]\n Yugoslavia developed a space program, as the forgotten third player in the Space Race beside United States and Soviet Union, which Josip Broz Tito then sold to the John F. Kennedy administration in the U.S. in return for $2.5 billion (film estimates at a value of about $50 billion today) in \"overseas aid\" which boosted Yugoslav economy. When the imported technology failed to deliver its promised results for the NASA's future Moon landing, an angry U.S. applied pressure to Tito, including financial blackmail and threats of military action, culminating in a secret CIA plot that triggered the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia.[7][8][9][10]\n It is international co-production by Studio Virc (Slovenia), Nukleus Film (Croatia) and Sutor Kolonko (Germany), backed by HBO Europe, Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Radiotelevizija Slovenija and the Doha Film Institute.[1][8][6] It is subsidized by Slovenian Film Centre, the Croatian Audiovisual Centre, Viba Film Studio, MEDIA Creative Europe, Eurimages and the Doha Film Institute. It's HBOs first co-production in the Adriatic region.[1]\n According to the director \u017diga Virc, the intention of the film was to \"tell the symbolic story of the rise and fall of Yugoslavia\",[8] as well inviting the viewer to decide what is real and what fiction.[1] In the film are mixed real archive footage with artful fabrication, and conspiracy theory about the Yugoslav space program. Although the film has many comic and emotional subplots, like the pig that served as the first test pilot, or the elderly engineer Ivan Pavi\u0107, one of twenty six Yugoslav engineers, who was forced to leave his young family, fake his death and funeral, for the undercovered move and work for NASA, and his later return to Croatia, confession and meeting with grown up daughter, they are all fictional. However, many details are real, like the underground military air base Objekat 505, Tito's visit to New York in 1963, during which he survived a failed assassination attempt, the scratchy recording of phone call between Tito and Kennedy, the recording by Richard Nixon (in a quote about Vietnam, \"We'll bomb those Yugoslav bastards right out of the\u2014off the earth. I really mean it.\", Yugoslavia is carefully added) and many others.[8][3][9][11]\n The film producer and co-writer Bo\u0161tjan Virc noted that they are aware \"not everyone will understand the nature of the film\". The point is the power of deception - the people believed a small production film with a hint, while on the other hand big news productions, companies, governments have no hints that something is wrong in the picture, and people take it for granted. He worriedly concluded that \"seeing is believing\" even if it is a complete fake.[12]\n The myth became popular in January 2012 when the filmmakers \u017diga and Bo\u0161tjan uploaded a short video clip on YouTube, which received in excess of one million views,[10][13] as well as extensive media attention including by Smithsonian Institution.[14][15][16] Most of the viewers believed in what they saw in the video, and in the same year internet survey by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 41.8% of the respondents of the online poll voted that they believe that Yugoslavia sold the program to US.[17]\n The myth is based on several facts: the work The Problem of Space Travel by Herman Poto\u010dnik (1892\u20131929) influenced German, American and Soviet scientists, but it is speculated[by whom?] that U.S. agents confiscated his surviving unpublished notes. In the early 1960s the financial support from the U.S. was larger than NASA's annual budgets, and after Dwight D. Eisenhower the policy was continued by Kennedy. Tito was the last foreign statesman to visit Kennedy before his death, and reasons for the U.S. financial support are not understood to this day.[17][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n There existed scientific cooperation between the United States and Yugoslavia, including the Yugoslav visits by the crews of Apollo 8, 9 and 11. On 26 September 1967, in Belgrade was held the first-ever international symposium on space exploration \"First Steps Toward Space\", while the second in New York. On 27 June 1971, in Belgrade was held an exhibition on space technologies, which brought together American and Soviet specialists, and fostered future cooperation.[17]\n Many Yugoslav engineers were employed by NASA, including Mike (Milojko) Vuceli\u0107 who worked on Apollo 11 and 13[18] and Anton Mavreti\u010d. The crew of Apollo 11 carried with it the flags of 135 countries including Yugoslavia during the Moon landing on 20 July 1969. The Yugoslavian lunar sample display is now held at the Museum of Yugoslav History in Belgrade.[17]\n Stephen Dalton from The Hollywood Reporter described the film as \"consistently witty and entertaining, even when testing the limits of audience gullibility... ultimately less a film about Cold War politics than a sly commentary on our current climate of internet myth-making and 'post-truth' public figures\", and that philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has a chorus role which warns that comforting fiction is often more appealing than complex fact, \"even if it didn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s true. That\u2019s the crucial message\".[8]\n Steve Pond from TheWrap described it as \"very entertaining, even if it\u2019s about as factual as This Is Spinal Tap\". He noted that the film \"acts like a doc but works as myth, not fact; director Ziga Virc doesn\u2019t want audiences to believe what he\u2019s telling them so much as he wants them to think about why they\u2019re so ready to accept any kind of tomfoolery and conspiracy the media puts in front of them\".[19]\n P. Stuart Robinson from Montages Magazine saw in the film structure parallels with Searching for Sugar Man, and described it as \"a minor masterpiece of plausible fabrication, tracking real events with an unwavering satirical eye, and placing them in a kind of perspective that is at once ridiculous and yet surprisingly illuminating. Above all, it\u2019s a good story in its own terms, a real cinematic page-turner\".[12]\n Noah Charney from the New York Observer paralleled it with \"Dr. Strangelove, part F for Fake, part real and part Spinal Tap\", and praised it to be a clever film which although mocks Yugo-nostalgia, intelligent viewers from former Yugoslavia, and especially from the U.S. may have a problem understanding it.[10]\n Jessica Kiang and Nick Schager from Variety and The Village Voice criticized that the \"little fun ... depends on falling for its far-fetched premise\",[20] and \"there are surely more compelling ways to offer it than via a one-note, 88-minute-long joke\".[21]\n", " Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (from the Greek cyto-, \"cell,\" and megalo-, \"large\") is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. Humans and monkeys serve as natural hosts. There are currently eight species in this genus including the type species, Human betaherpesvirus 5 (HCMV, human cytomegalovirus, HHV-5), which is the species that infects humans. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis, and pneumonia.[3][4] In the medical literature, most mentions of CMV without further specification refer implicitly to human CMV. Human CMV is the most studied of all cytomegaloviruses.[5]\n Within Herpesviridae, CMV belongs to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which also includes the genera Muromegalovirus and Roseolovirus (HHV-6 and HHV-7).[6] It is related to other herpesviruses within the subfamilies of Alphaherpesvirinae that includes herpes simplex viruses (HSV)-1 and -2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily that includes Epstein\u2013Barr virus.[5]\n The genus of cytomegalovirus is in the group dsDNA, in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, and the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae.[4]\n Several species of Cytomegalovirus have been identified and classified for different mammals.[6] The most studied is Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which is also known as Human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5). Other primate CMV species include Chimpanzee cytomegalovirus (CCMV) that infects chimpanzees and orangutans, and Simian cytomegalovirus (SCCMV) and Rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) that infect macaques; CCMV is known as both Panine herpesvirus 2 (PaHV-2) and Pongine herpesvirus-4 (PoHV-4).[7] SCCMV is called Cercopithecine herpesvirus-5 (CeHV-5)[8] and RhCMV,  Cercopithecine herpesvirus 8 (CeHV-8).[9] A further two viruses found in the night monkey are tentatively placed in the genus Cytomegalovirus, and are called Herpesvirus aotus 1 and Herpesvirus aotus 3.  Rodents also have viruses previously called cytomegaloviruses that are now reclassified under the genus Muromegalovirus; this genus contains Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is also known as Murid herpesvirus 1 (MuHV-1) and the closely related Murid herpesvirus 2 (MuHV-2) that is found in rats.[10]\n Viruses in Cytomegalovirus are enveloped, with icosahedral, spherical to pleomorphic, and round geometries, and T=16 symmetry. The diameter is around 150\u2013200\u00a0nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 200kb in length.[3]\n Viral replication is nuclear, and is lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model. DNA templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear egress, and budding.\nHuman and monkeys serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are contact, urine, and saliva.[3]\n All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods. Although they may be found throughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands in humans and other mammals.[6]\n The CMV promoter is commonly included in vectors used in genetic engineering work conducted in mammalian cells, as it is a strong promoter and drives constitutive expression of genes under its control.[11]\n Cytomegalovirus was first observed by German pathologist Hugo Ribbert in 1881 when he noticed enlarged cells with enlarged nuclei present in the cells of an infant.[12] Years later, between 1956 and 1957 Thomas Huckle Weller  together with Smith and Rowe independently isolated the virus, known thereafter as \u201ccytomegalovirus\u201d [13]. In 1990, the first draft of human cytomegalovirus genome was published [14], the biggest contiguous genome sequenced at that time [15].\n \n", " Arnfinn Engerbakk (born 22 March 1964) is a retired Norwegian football midfielder.\n He started his career in Nordre Trysil IL, and signed for Kongsvinger IL just after the 1985 season.[2] He was ever-present in the Norwegian Premier League in his first season, and became a club legend.[1] By late 1997 he had played in every position except for goalkeeper, and therefore got to tend the goal for a few minutes during his final home match.

However, the IDF curves are also analysed in hydrometeorology because of the interest in the time concentration or time-structure of the rainfall.[2]\n The IDF curves can take different mathematical expressions, theoretical or empirically fitted to observed rainfall data. For each duration (e.g. 5, 10, 60, 120, 180 ... minutes), the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), and a determined frequency or return period is set. Therefore, the empirical IDF curve is given by the union of the points of equal frequency of occurrence and different duration and intensity[3] Likewise, a theoretical or semi-empirical IDF curve is one whose mathematical expression is physically justified, but presents parameters that must be estimated by empirical fits.\n There is a large number of empirical approaches that relate the intensity (I), the duration (t) and the return period (p), from fits to power laws such as:\n In hydrometeorology, the simple power law (taking \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nc\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ c=0}\n\n) is used according to Monjo (2016) as a measure of the time-structure of the rainfall:[2]\n where \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\n\no\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ I_{o}}\n\n is defined as an intensity of reference for a fixed time \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nt\n\no\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ t_{o}}\n\n, i.e. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\na\n=\n\nI\n\no\n\n\n\nt\n\no\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ a=I_{o}t_{o}^{n}}\n\n, and \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ n}\n\n is a non-dimensional parameter known as n-index.

The primary star is a Wolf-Rayet star and one of the most luminous stars known.  The secondary has been suspected of being a stellar-mass black hole but may be a class O main sequence star.\n WR 148 shows a classic WN8h spectrum, but with the addition of weak central absorption on some of the emission lines.[10] NIII and NIV emission lines are stronger than NV, and HeI lines are stronger than HeII, The Balmer series hydrogen lines and some other lines have P Cygni profiles.[11]\n WR 148 is erratically variable on timescales ranging from seconds to years, but it shows consistent brightness and radial velocity variations with a period of 4.32 days. There is little doubt that it is a binary system, due to the regular variations and the presence of hard x-ray radiation from colliding winds, but the secondary is not clearly detectable in the spectrum.[3]  One proposal for a companion that would match the faint absorption features would be a B3 subgiant, but that is not compatible with the orbit.  An early calculated orbit based on faint absorption features gave a relatively large mass ratio which imply either a very high companion mass, meaning a black hole, or an unreasonably low primary mass for a luminous WR star.[10]  Another analysis of the spectrum finds absorption features consistent with an O5 star, similar masses for the two components, and only a small orbital inclination.[3]\n Because of its erratic changes in apparent magnitude at so many frequencies WR 148 is classified in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as a unique type of variable, not a member of any of the defined classes.[2] The shape of the light curve is unusual and has been modelled as being produced by an extended secondary object which may be an ionised cavity in the dense wind of the primary star, produced as the secondary orbits at a distance comparable to the radius of the primary star.[10]\n WR 148 is found unusually far from the galactic plane for a Wolf-Rayet star, at 500 - 800 pc. Young massive stars such as WN8h WR stars are members of the thin disc population, on average only 60 pc from the galactic plane. It is suggested that WR 148 is a runaway from a supernova explosion.[10]  Calculations based on its large peculiar velocity of 197\u00a0km/s, current binary orbit, and likely lifetime since any supernova, are consistent with expulsion from a very massive triple system.[3]\n", " Companc may refer to:\n", " The 2016\u201317 North Carolina Central Eagles men's basketball team represented North Carolina Central University during the 2016\u201317 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Furthermore, she was granted the right to use the title of queen. This created a conflict with her brother Afonso II O Gordo, who, wanting a centralized power, hindered his sister from receiving the titles and the corresponding rights. Afonso feared that something similar could happen with his two sisters, Teresa and Sancha, and their eventual heirs, creating a problem of sovereignty that could come to divide the country. Much of the Portuguese nobles sided with Mafalda and her sisters, but they were defeated.[1] On the death of Afonso II, his son Sancho II granted some lands and castles to his aunts but he made them renounce the title of princess-queen. The final peace came in 1223.\n In 1215, a political marriage was arranged between Mafalda and her young cousin Henry I of Castile. As he was about ten years old, the marriage was never consummated, and it was dissolved the following year on grounds of consanguinity.[2]\nShe returned to Portugal.\n Mafalda then entered the Abbey of Arouca, which had adopted the Cistercian observance, but was granted a special dispensation to retain control of her inheritance. She had a great devotion to Our Lady of Silva and made substantial donations to the shrine in Oporto. she also had a hospice for travelers built as well as a number of bridges, churches, monasteries, and hospitals.[3]\n Returning from a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Silva, she fell ill at Rio Tinto (Gondomar) and died in the monastery there on May 1, 1256. In 1616, wanting to move her body to Arouca it was found not to have deteriorated, which generated a strong devotion to the Portuguese princess. She was beatified in 1792. Her feast is celebrated on May 2.\n", " \n Periclepsis cinctana, the Dover twist, is a species of moth of the Tortricidae family. It is found in most of Europe, where it has been recorded from Spain, Great Britain, the Benelux, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Sweden, the Baltic region and Russia.[2] The habitat consists of chalk downlands and calcareous grasslands.[3]\n The wingspan is 13\u201317\u00a0mm.[4] There are contrasting cream and brown markings on the forewings.[5] Adults have been recorded on wing from late April to the beginning of July.\n The larvae feed on Lotus, Anthyllis, Genista and Cytisus species from  within a tubular silken gallery. The species overwinters in the larval stage.[6]\n \n", " Isa Lake is located in Yellowstone National Park, in the U.S. state of Wyoming.[2] The lake straddles the continental divide at Craig Pass and was first discovered in 1891 by Hiram M. Chittenden, who was exploring the best routes for a road to connect Old Faithful and West Thumb geyser basins. Chittenden named the lake after Miss Isabel Jelke, from Cincinnati, though it is not clear why.[3][4]\n Isa Lake is believed to be one of only two natural lakes in the world which drain to two different oceans, the other being Wollaston Lake.[3] (For similar cases see List of unusual drainage systems.) The east side of the lake drains by way of the Lewis River to the Pacific Ocean and the west side of the lake drains by way of the Firehole River to the Gulf of Mexico.[5]\n The lake is easy to visit as it is adjacent to the road that now connects the Old Faithful and West Thumb geysers basins, on what is known as the \"lower loop\" of the figure-eight roadway which traverses through Yellowstone.\n Isa Lake, 1921\n Isa Lake on Craig Pass Road\n Isa Lake\n", " Karmanowice [karman\u0254\u02c8vit\u0361s\u025b] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina W\u0105wolnica, within Pu\u0142awy County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.[1] It lies approximately 7 kilometres (4\u00a0mi) north of W\u0105wolnica, 13\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi) south-east of Pu\u0142awy, and 34\u00a0km (21\u00a0mi) west of the regional capital Lublin.\n \n Coordinates: 51\u00b021\u203200\u2033N 22\u00b007\u203200\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.3500\u00b0N 22.1167\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.3500; 22.1167\n", " \n The 2009\u201310 season was the 115th season in the history of Plymouth Argyle Football Club, their 85th in the Football League, and 41st in the second tier of the English football league system. Their 21st-place finish in the 2008\u201309 season meant it was their sixth successive season playing in the Championship. Their campaign ended disappointingly as they were relegated to League One with 11 wins, 8 draws, and 27 losses from 46 matches. The club exited both domestic cup competitions at the first stage, being eliminated by Newcastle United in the third round of the FA Cup and by Gillingham in the first round of the League Cup. The club changed managers in December due to a string of poor results as Paul Sturrock was replaced by Paul Mariner.\n The club began their league campaign with two draws, but defeat by Cardiff City marked the beginning of a seven-game losing streak. Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner. Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures during the Christmas period, including a 4\u20131 win against Reading; their best of the season. The club signed Damien Johnson in the winter transfer window from Birmingham City and made a number of signings on loan, including Kenny Cooper and David Stockdale, in order to try to improve their league position. A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February, which prompted Mariner to make more signings.\n Argyle lost three of their next nine matches to give themselves a chance of avoiding relegation, but their win at Doncaster Rovers proved to be the last game that they would collect any points in. Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club on the brink of a return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in their next game. Newcastle United won 2\u20130 at Home Park to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club Peterborough United on the final day of the season, eight points adrift of safety. Jamie Mackie finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain Carl Fletcher was voted Player of the Year.\n The 2008\u201309 season was Paul Sturrock's first full campaign in his second spell as the club's manager.[1] The club secured their status in the second tier of English football for a sixth season after finishing 21st in the league table, five points above Norwich City.[2][3] A number of players returned to their parent clubs at the end of the season after successful loan spells,[4] including Craig Cathcart, David Gray, Alan Judge and Paul Gallagher. Sturrock wanted to bring Gallagher back to the club on a permanent basis, but was eventually unsuccessful after admitting before the season finished that the transfer fee and wages were an issue.[5] Three apprentices of the club's youth system were offered professional contracts in May, including Irish youth international Joe Mason.[6] The club's first signing of the summer was Carl Fletcher, who returned to Home Park permanently after signing on loan in February. Fletcher replaced Karl Duguid as the team captain,[7][8] and Romain Larrieu was named club captain.[9] Sir Roy Gardner was confirmed as the club's new chairman in July, replacing Paul Stapleton who remained on the new board as vice-chairman.[10] The club added to their squad that month with the permanent signings of Bradley Wright-Phillips, K\u00e1ri \u00c1rnason and R\u00e9da Johnson, while Jermaine Easter and long-serving Frenchman Mathias Kouo-Doumb\u00e9 were among the players who left. Doumbe was released from his contract by mutual consent in August after five years with the club.[11]\n Plymouth Argyle began their campaign at Selhurst Park on 8 August against Crystal Palace, with Carl Fletcher captaining his new side against his former club.[12] An early goal from Hungarian international centre-back Kriszti\u00e1n Tim\u00e1r put Argyle ahead but the home side responded in the second half to give both teams a share of the points.[13] Argyle faced Queens Park Rangers in their first home game of the season and an injury-time own goal from Kaspars Gork\u0161s salvaged a point after the visitors had taken the lead in the first-half.[14] Alan Gow's first goal for the club in their next match against Cardiff City was merely a consolation, as a hat-trick from Michael Chopra consigned Argyle to their first league defeat of the season.[15] A stoppage time goal from Derby County's Miles Addison denied Argyle their third draw of the season after they had taken a first-half lead through Alan Judge,[16] and a second 3\u20131 home defeat followed a week later, this time against Sheffield Wednesday.[17] A first-half goal from Jamie Mackie gave Argyle hope of their first victory of new the season at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion, but the home side responded with three goals either side of half-time to claim a comfortable win.[18]\n The club's poor run of form continued in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped to the bottom of the league table.[19] Another 3\u20131 defeat, against Newcastle United,[20] was followed by a second successive 1\u20130 home defeat against Nottingham Forest,[21] to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches.[22] Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United,[23] and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season.[24]  \"It's nice to get three points, but now we have to build on it,\" said Sturrock. \"There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again.\" Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2\u20131 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper.[25] Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2\u20130 at Bloomfield Road.[26] The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle.[27] He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway,[28] a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. \"I suppose it was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better,\" said executive director Keith Todd. \"We understood exactly what we are doing.\"[29]\n An Argyle Hall of Famer returned to Home Park on 18 October 2009,[30] when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. \"In football, there is not much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands,\" said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. \"Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there, I was delighted.\"[31] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3\u20131 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate.[32] They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer.[33] Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager.[34] Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.[35]\n The club began November in the same fashion they ended the previous month \u2013 with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2\u20131 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone.[36] They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King.[37] Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed,[38] which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad,[39] but a third consecutive 1\u20130 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off,[40] signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager.[41][42] Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice.[43] \"It's a sad day, but obviously a happy day for me because I'm getting my chance to be a manager in the league,\" said the former striker. \"He's a great friend of mine. The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other.\"[44] His first match was a 2\u20130 defeat at Preston North End,[45] but he took positives from the performance.[46][47]\n John Carver, right-hand man to former Barcelona manager Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United,[48] arrived as the club's new assistant manager on 17 December 2009,[49] but the club suffered another 1\u20130 defeat at home, against Coventry City, two days later.[50] Argyle travelled to Cardiff on Boxing Day to play Cardiff City at their new stadium,[51] and came away with an important three points thanks to a late goal from Sawyer.[52] They recorded their biggest win of the season two days later against Reading.[53] A brace from Judge,[54] and first goals of the season for K\u00e1ri \u00c1rnason and Ashley Barnes secured a 4\u20131 win at Home Park and six points from their two games over the Christmas period.[55] Argyle returned to league action after their FA Cup ties on 16 January, looking for another three points against Crystal Palace but an early goal from young striker Victor Moses won the game for the visitors.[56] Another must-win home game followed against Derby County and a fifth goal of the season from Jamie Mackie boosted their survival bid.[57] A defeat by fellow struggler's Sheffield Wednesday,[58] coupled with other results going against them, left Argyle five points from safety,[59] with a tough match to come against West Bromwich Albion a week later. A single goal from striker Simon Cox kept Albion in touch at the top of the table and left Argyle deep in relegation trouble again, six points from safety.[60]\n A stoppage time penalty from Shane Long earned a crucial 2\u20131 win for Reading in Argyle's next match,[61] but they came from a goal behind to claim a 3\u20131 victory at Barnsley four days later,[62] which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon.[63] Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. \"We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times,\" he said.[64] \"The introduction of Bolasie was a breath of fresh air. I think even the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked to see what he was doing. He brought a lot to the table for us.\"[65] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1\u20131 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea,[66] and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester.[67] An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4\u20133 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes.[68] Argyle went 3\u20130 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale.[69] In the aftermath, Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason, describing him as \"an incredible talent.\"[70]\n Argyle salvaged a late point against Preston North End at the start of March, but remained in serious trouble at the bottom end of the table, seven points adrift of safety with 13 matches remaining.[71] A 2\u20130 defeat followed at Queens Park Rangers,[72] with Adel Taarabt playing a part in both of the home sides goals.[73] Draws at Home Park were proving to be an Achilles' heel for Argyle, but they secured a creditable 1\u20131 draw at play-off chasing Coventry City, having taken the lead through a glancing header from \u00c1rnason.[74] Three days later, a 20-yard strike from captain Fletcher earned Argyle their fifth home win of the season in a 3\u20132 thriller against Bristol City. They had taken a 2\u20130 lead through Chris Clark and an overhead kick from Bradley Wright-Phillips,[75] his first for the club. However, the visitors responded in the second-half with two goals from Nicky Maynard before former Welsh international Fletcher scored with seconds to spare.[76] Argyle travelled to play Scunthorpe United looking to keep up the momentum, but threw away a lead to be defeated by a deflected effort from Martyn Woolford.[77]\n They were on the road again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road.[78] Argyle came away with all three points courtesy of goals from Wright-Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner.[79] \"It was pretty special and I was a little choked up,\" he said. \"It was a special night. When I moved to the States 20 years ago, I didn't think it would come to fruition but it was a tremendous reception from the fans, and I can't thank them enough. Bringing Plymouth Argyle here in my present role was a special occasion.\"[80] Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park for the first time since his departure in November 2007 in the club's next game, and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2\u20130 victory, with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat.[81] Argyle played out an entertaining 0\u20130 draw at home with Barnsley three days later,[82] but it did little to help in their battle against relegation, still five points away from safety.[83] They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2\u20131 win, coming from behind with second-half goals from Mason, and an injury time header from Wright-Phillips.[84] In order to stay up, Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games, but they went down 2\u20130 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side,[85] which left them four points adrift with four games left.[86] A solitary goal from Watford's Heidar Helguson dealt Argyle's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road,[87] but vice-captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game. \"We'll be upbeat, and we'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday.\"[88]\n It was a night of contrasting emotions at Home Park.[89][90] A 2\u20130 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt.[91] Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer it to the top flight of English football.[92] Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. \"I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start,\" he said. \"The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but I firmly believe that we can do it.\"[93] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3\u20130 victory against the relegated side.[94] The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May.[95] Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach.[96] He said: \"I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that.\"[97] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.[98]\n Colours: Green = Plymouth Argyle win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.\n Pld = Matches played; W = Matches won; D = Matches drawn; L = Matches lost; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; GD = Goal difference; Pts = Points\n Pld = Matches played; W = Matches won; D = Matches drawn; L = Matches lost; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; GD = Goal difference\n The third round draw for the FA Cup paired Argyle with Newcastle United, which left assistant manager John Carver with mixed emotions.[99] Neither side could break the deadlock in a competitive contest at Home Park.[100] Argyle striker Rory Fallon forced a good save from Tim Krul before the visitors had chances of their own, the majority of which went to Fabrice Pancrate. Newcastle looked likely to win the game late on but were denied by goalkeeper Romain Larrieu, who tipped a looping volley from Nicky Butt over the crossbar.[101] The match saw the return of Chris Barker to the Argyle defence after a lengthy spell on the sidelines because of injury, and manager Paul Mariner was full of praise for his performance. \"For him to come and do what he did against such a high powered, attacking team as Newcastle and playing 90 plus minutes was pretty remarkable. He's a very strong character and very experienced.\"[102] The replay at St James' Park was Argyle's next match due to the wintry weather,[103][104] and they were on the wrong end of a 3\u20130 scoreline. Newcastle striker Peter L\u00f8venkrands gave the home side a two-goal lead at half-time and completed his hat-trick after 72 minutes.[105][106] \"His timing of his runs is pretty special and for the first goal, his finish was fantastic,\" said Mariner. The match on Tyneside was to be the last in an Argyle shirt for Cillian Sheridan who returned to Celtic in Scotland the next day when his loan spell with the club finished, having made 13 appearances, scoring no goals.[107]\n Colours: Green = Plymouth Argyle win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.\n Having been drawn to face Gillingham in the first round of the League Cup, the club's manager, Paul Sturrock, planned to make a couple of changes to the team that faced Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new season, with youngster Joe Mason included in the squad.[108] Two first-half goals were enough to take the hosts into the second round. Simeon Jackson put Gillingham ahead after 42 minutes and Andy Barcham scored a second just before the half-time break. Argyle reduced the deficit four minutes into the second-half when Luke Summerfield from a direct free kick, but they couldn't find an equaliser.[109] The visitors should have forced extra time but Jamie Mackie spurned a chance when he pulled his shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. The defeat extended Sturrock's unfortunate run in the League Cup as a manager, having won just once in nine attempts. \"I must have the worst record of all managers in cup competitions, it's unbelievable,\" he said. \"One or two of my defenders didn't defend properly tonight. It's not proper to name people but there were some glaring attempts to clear the ball and that's where we had problems.\"[110]\n Colours: Green = Plymouth Argyle win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.\n Pre-season for Plymouth Argyle began on 1 July 2009 when the first team squad returned to Harpers Park.[111] A week of intense training followed,[112] before the club's first match of the new season took place on 13 July 2009 against Cornish side Truro City. In a match which featured trialist K\u00e1ri \u00c1rnason,[113] Argyle scored a goal in each half to earn a comfortable win.[114] A youthful Argyle team headed across the city of Plymouth the next day to take on Plymouth Parkway. The visitors fell behind to an early goal but responded with three of their own in an entertaining friendly, including a brace from Republic of Ireland youth international Joe Mason.[115] The first team were in action again the next day, against Torquay United. The visitors went behind twice but looked like leaving Plainmoor with a win until Torquay converted a penalty in the 90th minute.[116] The squad then departed for a tour of Scotland, and stopped off in the north of England on the way in order to play a friendly against Skelmersdale United on 18 July 2009.[117] Argyle came away with a 2\u20130 win after scoring a goal in each half.[118] A picturesque setting greeted the squad as they took to the field against Livingston on 20 July 2009. An 81st-minute penalty from Luke Summerfield wasn't enough to save Argyle from their first defeat of the season.\n Hungarian international Zolt\u00e1n Sz\u00e9lesi joined the squad in training ahead of their next match against Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni.[119] They came from behind to record a 2\u20131 win in a feisty encounter, with Steve MacLean scoring the decisive goal.[120] Argyle returned to England to play against Morecambe on 25 July 2009, and included a triallist called R\u00e9da Johnson in their defence, who appeared in the match under a pseudonym. Two second half goals ensured that they left Christie Park with a win.[121] The club's only pre-season friendly to take place at Home Park was against Scottish club Heart of Midlothian on 29 July 2009. Neither side could break the deadlock in a dour 0\u20130 draw.[122] Swindon Town were the opposition for Argyle's penultimate friendly. A goal from Marcel Seip after 57 minutes set the visitors on their way to a 2\u20130 victory at manager Paul Sturrock's old club.[123] Argyle's final pre-season match took place on 3 August 2009 against Tiverton Town. A young team containing only two senior professionals, Yoann Folly and Simon Walton,[124] secured a 1\u20130 win at Ladysmead.[125]\n Colours: Green = Plymouth Argyle win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.\n Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Originally, the company's only service was dry cleaning. Seeing a great opportunity in the local market, Coit began to offer drapery cleaning services.  Coit's founder, Louis J Kearn, developed a number of patents for drapery cleaning. In 1952, Louis instituted a guarantee of the company's work, which was very unusual at that time for the industry. In 1963 Coit opened the world's first specialized drapery cleaning facility in Burlingame, California. Coit started franchising in 1962 with the first franchisee opening in Eureka, California. By the 1970s the company had over 155 locations across the United States and had expanded its services to include carpet and upholstery cleaning. The 1990s saw an expansion into HVAC cleaning, tile and grout cleaning, and hardwood floor refinishing.  In the 2000s Coit purchased Superior Restoration, Inc. in Seattle, Washington and soon began to offer fire, smoke, and water damage restoration services nationwide. Coit now offers many kinds of residential and commercial cleaning, and restoration services.\n Coit's franchises have expanded to include locations in the United States, Canada, and Thailand. They have company owned locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, but their corporate base is in Burlingame, California. Coit is an LLC with owner, Mr. Kearn owning 10% of the CO. Coit continues to service more than 500,000 customers yearly.\n In 2003, Coit Services settled a lawsuit brought by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The lawsuit had been filed by female employees who claimed that they had been physically and verbally harassed by founder and chairman Louis Kearn.  Coit agreed to pay US$190,000 to the plaintiffs, provide sexual harassment training for all of its employees, and apologize to a female employee who was denied promotion after making claims of sexual harassment.\n In 1993, Coit was sued in a California state court by an employee who claimed to have been harassed by Kearn.  Coit's liability insurer refused to defend on the grounds that its policy did not cover intentional acts.  The employee settled with Coit; then their lawyers joined forces and sued the insurer.  The trial court's directed verdict for the insurer was upheld by the California Court of Appeal (First District), which agreed with the insurer's application of its policy to this situation.

A sudden downturn in house prices and increases in interest rates well before the November 1973 oil crisis left the smaller institutions holding many loans secured by property with lower value than the loans. The Bank of England, led by Jasper Hollom,[1] conducted negotiations resulting in bail-outs of around 30 of the smaller banks and intervened to assist some 30 others. While all of the banks were left able to pay depositors, the Bank of England lost an estimated \u00a3100 million.[2] The downturn was exacerbated by the global 1973\u201374 stock market crash, which hit the UK while it was already in the midst of the housing price crash.\n On 19 December 1974, a rent freeze by the Edward Heath government which had lasted since 1971 was ended, and the Bank of England, which had severely restricted the supply of credit for housing in 1971, released more funds.[3][4] While housing prices and lending recovered in 1975, inflation continued to rise, leading to greater economic, labour and political problems for Britain.\n The Bank of England's regulatory powers over lenders were increased in the 1979 Banking Act to try to prevent a repeat of the crisis.\n The causes remain a source of debate. Some blame the lax regulation of lenders and policy-driven inflationary pressures (the 'Barber Boom', named after Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber), which failed in its target of lowering the high unemployment rate. A sudden tightening of credit (interest rates were raised to 13% in October 1973) was laid at the feet of the Bank of England.[5]\n Others blame the Heath government's fixing of rent price rises in 1971.[3] The only book-length study of the crisis by Reid (1982) blames all those factors but also a bubble of housing prices that saw a 50% increase in London real estate prices over 1971 and the financial uncertainty caused by the end of the Bretton Woods agreement and the inconclusive elections of February 1974. The period was also marked by a series of crises, including the political uncertainty of the Heath government, waves of public sector and industrial strikes and oil shortages that led to a government-mandated three-day work week. However, Reid also blames the entire market culture of the London banking institutions from the late 1960s, which she considers made market speculation (and consequent crashes) inevitable.[2]\n", " Mark Setteducati (born November 1, 1955) is a magician and inventor of magic, illusions, games and puzzles.[1] He is also an author, known for the book, The Magic Show,[2] and featured on PBS Inventors.[3][4]\n Setteducati was born in New York City, NY and grew up in Emerson, New Jersey. He received his BFA in Art and Design from the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York.[5] He later became a member of the faculty, where he created and taught the first ever toy and game design class, which allowed students to be able to receive a BFA with a major in Toy Design.[1]\n From 1975 to 1980, Setteducati was the assistant to artist, Louise Bourgeois, and in 1992 he performed Magic in \u201cShe Lost it\u201d, a performance piece by Bourgeois at the Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia.[1]\n After working as an in-house designer for Astra Trading[6]  and teaching design at his alma mater, he decided to become a full-time independent inventor. His first invention that he licensed was in 1981, Rubik Game, a game where you play tic-tac-toe on a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Later he developed and designed Rubik's Illusion, which later would lead to a project with the Harry Potter franchise.[1]\n Throughout his career, Setteducati developed and licensed puzzles and games to toy companies around the world. In 1986, he designed a game travel version of the Wheel of Fortune game show, which went on to sell millions of copies, and as well as the travel versions of Jeopardy![1] and the Dating Game.[6] A year later in 1987, he designed his first magic set with Harry Blackstone, Jr. that was produced by Pressman Toy Company.[6]\n In 1994, Setteducati created the \"Magic Works\" brand for Milton Bradley, an all-time best-selling line of magic tricks that are geared towards children.[1][7]\n In 1993, along with Tom Rodgers and Elwyn Berlekamp, Setteducati founded the bi-annual conference, Gathering 4 Gardner and is currently a member of their board of directors.[8]\n Released by Jumbo in 1994, Setteducati's \"Magic Showcase\" offered performers instant acts.[6]\n Setteducati co-created and invented Ji Ga Zo with Ken Knowlton, a universal jigsaw puzzle system, debuted in Japan and in 2011, it started being distributed by Hasbro in the United States.[9]\n In 2013, Setteducati was featured on PBS Digital Studio series, \"Inventors\", which is produced by David Friedman.[4]\n The Academy of Magical Arts awarded Setteducati the Creative Fellowship Award for 2014, and an honorary lifetime membership to The Magic Castle, Hollywood, California.[10]\n He is a member of the educational non-profit corporation, Gathering 4 Gardner.[1]\n Setteducati has over ten thousand pens, he is the largest novelty pen collector in the world.[1][12]\n", " \n Edward \"Ed\" Fernon (born 6 February 1988) is an Australian modern pentathlete.

He was associated with the electronic style intelligent dance music (IDM) during the 1990s, and recorded on Rephlex Records alongside artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. His critically acclaimed 1997 album, Lunatic Harness, helped defined the drill 'n' bass subgenre and was also his most successful release, selling over 100,000 copies. He is also founder of the record label Planet Mu, begun in 1995, where he has championed genres such as juke and footwork.\n Paradinas was born in Charing Cross and began playing keyboards during the early 1980s, and listened to new wave music such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Heaven 17 and early Human League.[3] He joined a few bands in the mid-1980s, then spent eight years on keyboards for the group Blue Innocence.\n During this period, Paradinas had been recording on his own as well with synthesizers and a four-track recorder. In 1995, following a performance at \"The Orange\" in London, Blue Innocence broke up. Paradinas and the bass player, Francis Naughton, bought sequencing software and re-recorded some of Paradinas's older tracks. After the material was played for Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton \u2014 the duo behind Global Communication and the heads of Evolution Records \u2014 it was to be released; however, recording commitments later forced Pritchard and Middleton to withdraw their agreement. Fortunately for Paradinas, Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin) had also heard the tracks and agreed to release their music on Rephlex Records under the alias \u03bc-Ziq.\n Naughton then left \u03bc-Ziq to start Rocket Goldstar. A second album Bluff Limbo was scheduled to be released in mid-1994, though only 1000 copies were published. It was re-issued by Rephlex in 1996 after Paradinas served papers on the label.[citation needed] Paradinas's first major-label release came later in 1994, after he undertook a remix project for Virgin Records: the remix EP The Auteurs Vs \u03bc-Ziq for the britpop band the Auteurs. The remixes Paradinas offered sounded nothing like the original song, a familiar practice for many experimental electronic musicians in those times.\n Even though the EP was hardly a high sales success, Virgin signed up Paradinas and gave him his own sublabel, Planet Mu, to release his own work and to develop similar-minded artists. (Paradinas later broke with Virgin and in 1998 established Planet Mu as his own independent label.) Written into his own contract was a provision for unlimited recording under different names, and during 1995 Paradinas unveiled three aliases and released many albums within less than a year. The neo-electro music label Clear released his debut single under the alias Tusken Raiders (named after the Star Wars species) early in the year. Clear Records also released the first Paradinas alias full-length album, Jake Slazenger MakesARacket, later in 1995. Although they were still audible, the LP ignored the electro influences in favour of some synthesizer figures and the previously unheard influence of jazz-funk. Paradinas continued to release solo albums under the above-mentioned names as well as Gary Moscheles, and a one-time collaboration with Aphex Twin under the Mike & Rich moniker.\n In 1997 Paradinas made a style change again, mixing experimental electronic music with drum'n'bass, a similar aesthetic path taken by Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. During this year he was also touring with popular musician Bj\u00f6rk. Bj\u00f6rk inspired the 1999 album Royal Astronomy, with its mixture of unusual vocals, strings and breakbeat. All of his albums until 2003 were released in the USA on the more mainstream label, Astralwerks.\n Paradinas is the owner of the Planet Mu label, which hosts electronic musicians such as Venetian Snares, Capitol K, and Luke Vibert.\n \n", " The 1996 Lindsay by-election was held in the Australian electorate of Lindsay in New South Wales on 19 October 1996. The by-election was triggered by a ruling of the Court of Disputed Returns that the election of the Liberal Party candidate Jackie Kelly was invalid, due to her citizenship status and employment by the Royal Australian Air Force. The writ for the by-election was issued on 16 September 1996.\n Jackie Kelly won the seat of Lindsay from Labor's Ross Free at the 1996 federal election \u2013 a surprise win as Lindsay was considered a safe Labor seat.[1] However, Kelly's election was challenged on two counts: that she had not renounced her New Zealand citizenship (Section 44 of the Australian Constitution states that \"a subject or citizen of a foreign power\" is ineligible to stand for federal parliament),[2] and that at the time of her nomination as a candidate she was employed as a legal officer for the Royal Australian Air Force (s. 44  also prohibits any person who \"holds any office of profit under the Crown\" from election to parliament).[3] The Court of Disputed Returns ruled on 11 September 1996 that Kelly's election was indeed constitutionally invalid, and a by-election was called several days later. Kelly, by this time, had resigned from the RAAF and renounced her New Zealand citizenship, and was eligible to stand as a candidate in the by-election.\n Jackie Kelly won the by-election with an even larger majority \u2013 a swing of 4.97% in her favour.\n", " \n Flitch Green is a civil parish in the Uttlesford district of Essex, England.

Although his father had sons by his first marriage, these were postponed by special remainder to the succession of his dukedom behind the male issue of his second marriage, due to the suspected adultery of his first wife. This senior line did eventually inherit the dukedom in 1750, as the special remainder allowed, on the death of the 7th Duke of Somerset without male progeny.\n From 1547, when his father was created Duke of Somerset, his son Edward Seymour was styled by the duke's subsidiary title of Earl of Hertford. He was educated with the young Prince Edward, later Edward VI, and was knighted on the occasion of Edward's coronation.[2] On 7 April 1550 he was sent to France as a hostage, returning three weeks later. Following his father's disgrace and execution, his son was barred from inheriting his titles and most of his wealth. Some of his father's lands and property were restored to him by Edward VI, but he still seemed to have been forced to rely on Sir John Thynne for some financial support.[2] Under Queen Mary he was \"restored in blood\", but was not given back his title; Queen Elizabeth I created him Earl of Hertford, in the earldom's second creation, in 1559.[2] Between April and May 1605[3] following the Treaty of London (1604) he was sent on an Embassy by King James I to Albert VII, Archduke of Austria,[4] sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands between 1598 and 1621, at Brussels, to receive his oath of peace.\n His first wife, Lady Catherine Grey, was a potential claimant to Elizabeth's throne, and law established that it was a penal offence for her to marry without notifying the Sovereign. They were married by an anonymous clergyman at Hertford House in Cannon Row, Westminster, before 25 December 1560. The marriage was kept secret until August nearly a year later when Catherine became visibly pregnant and she confided the reason to Lord Robert Dudley. Each was ordered to confinement in the Tower; Catherine was confined immediately, and Seymour imprisoned upon his return from a tour of the continent with Sir Thomas Cecil. While in custody, they were questioned about every aspect of their marriage, but they both claimed to have forgotten the date.\n A commission was begun, headed by Archbishop Parker in February 1562. Under this pressure, Lady Catherine finally declared that they had waited for Elizabeth to quit the capital for Eltham Palace. Servants were questioned, and none of them could remember the exact date either. John Fortescue said it was 'in November'. The priest could not be located, but by consulting the accounts of the Cofferer of the Household the marriage date was decided to be 27 November.\n His son Edward was declared illegitimate and the father was fined 15,000\u00a0pounds in Star Chamber for \"seducing a virgin of the blood royal.\"\n Despite all this, the Earl apparently found a way to continue marital relations with his wife in the Tower. In February 1563, Thomas Seymour was born. Lady Catherine died in 1568, and Seymour was finally allowed out of the Tower and allowed to re-appear at court. Officially his sons remained bastards. In 1576 he carried the sword of state at Elizabeth's procession of the knights of the garter.[5]\n In 1582, he married his second wife, Frances Howard. Their union was in secret, and remained a secret for nearly a decade, with Frances serving as a gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber. Hertford attempted to have this marriage set aside in 1595 (hoping to clear his still illegitimate sons' claim to the throne). He was arrested again, and Frances died in 1598.\n In May 1601, he secretly married once more, to the wealthy widow Frances Prannell, also born Frances Howard, the daughter of Thomas Howard, 1st Viscount Howard of Bindon. The marriage was performed by Thomas Montfort without banns or licence, for which Monfort was suspended for three years by Archbishop John Whitgift.[10]\n His principal seats were as follows:\n He died in 1621 at Netley Abbey and was buried in the Seymour Chapel of Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire, where survives his elaborate monument in white alabaster with effigies of a himself and his first wife recumbent, he dressed in armour, and she in robes, both praying; at their head and feet is a kneeling effigy of each of their sons, fully dressed in armour, under four Corinthian marble columns. On the top are several figures and pyramids.[13] Around the central inscribed tablet are impaled heraldic escutcheons showing the marriages of their respective Seymour and Grey ancestors. The Latin inscriptions are as follows:[14]\n Lower under the arch, on a black marble tablet, in gold capitals, is this inscription\u00a0: \n Underneath the armed man, on the right hand, in capitals\u00a0:\n Underneath another figure in armour, in capitals, is this inscription\u00a0:\n", " \n Opuntia microdasys (angel's-wings, bunny ears cactus, bunny cactus or polka-dot cactus) is a species of flowering plant in the cactus family Cactaceae, native and endemic to central and northern Mexico.[1]\n Opuntia microdasys forms a dense shrub 40\u201360\u00a0cm tall, occasionally more, composed of pad-like stems 6\u201315\u00a0cm long and 4\u201312\u00a0cm broad.\n Instead of spines it has numerous white or yellow glochids 2\u20133\u00a0mm long in dense clusters.

Cocea (common rendition of Nicolae Dumitru Cocea, Romanian pronunciation:\u00a0[niko\u02c8la.e du\u02c8mitru \u02c8kot\u0361\u0283e\u032fa], also known as Niculae, Niculici or Nicu Cocea; November 29, 1880 \u2013 February 1, 1949) was a Romanian journalist, novelist, critic and left-wing political activist, known as a major but controversial figure in the field of political satire. The founder of many newspapers and magazines, including Via\u021ba Social\u0103, Rampa, Facla and Chemarea, collaborating with writer friends such as Tudor Arghezi, Gala Galaction and Ion Vinea, he fostered and directed the development of early modernist literature in Romania. Cocea later made his name as a republican and anticlerical agitator, was arrested as an instigator during the 1907 peasant revolt, and played a leading role in regrouping the scattered socialist clubs. His allegiances however switched between parties: during World War I, he supported the Entente Powers and, as a personal witness of the October Revolution, the government of Soviet Russia, before returning home as a communist.\n During the interwar period, Cocea was elected to Romanian Parliament as an independent socialist, campaigned for the outlawed Romanian Communist Party, and found his press banned by the authorities on several occasions. In 1923, he was found guilty of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9. Cocea, although kept under constant surveillance, was rumored to have been an opportunistic double dealer, and his personal life was a matter of public scandal. His novels, the vast majority of which are samples of erotic literature, fueled innuendo about his sexual exploits, which also resulted in his sentencing for statutory rape. After World War II, Cocea was again close to the Communist Party and, from 1948, rose to prominence as an official writer for the communist regime.\n For a while the son-in-law of journalist Constantin Mille, N. D. Cocea was from a theatrical family: his daughters Dina and Tantzi, like his sister Alice before them, were acclaimed actresses. Another daughter, Ioana-Maria Cocea, is a noted sculptor.\n Born in B\u00e2rlad, Cocea claimed lineage from the lesser boyar aristocracy of Moldavia.[1][2][3] His father, Dumitru Cocea, was a Romanian Land Forces officer, who would reach the rank of General.[3][4][5][6] The Coceas descended from an 18th-century Albanian Moldavian Serdar Gheorghe Cocea,[7] but claimed lineage from a 16th-century soldier in the armies of Michael the Brave.[5] Nicolae's mother, Cleopatra, was a published author and a journalist.[3] She hailed from a family of yeomen (r\u0103ze\u0219i)[7] or landowners, and her artistic education helped shape his cultural tastes from early childhood.[8] Although he made his name as a writer and journalist, his most ardent wish was to become an actor.[5]\n Nicolae attended primary school in his native town, and had a hectic adolescence, determined by his father's successive postings.[7] He is known to have first been enlisted at the National High School of Ia\u0219i.[9] During the late 1890s, young Cocea was in Bucharest, attending the Saint Sava National College, becoming close friends with two other students and future writers: one was Galaction, the other was Vasile Demetrius. Another Saint Sava student, Ion G. Duca (the Prime Minister of Romania in 1933), was occasionally present among them, but political differences drew them apart with time.[10] Despite oral tradition, Arghezi, who joined the Cocea group around the same time, may not have been a Saint Sava student at all: according to literary historian C. Popescu-Cadem, there is no record of him ever attending that institution.[11] Cocea's own education was vague. He flunked out after the 3rd and 7th grades, was transferred to Ploie\u0219ti, then returned to Saint Sava only to pass reexamination.[9]\n Cocea and his Saint Sava friends were already leftists who attended the public lectures of senior socialist leader Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.[12] According to literary historian Tudor Vianu, the four youths, including the \"restless, daring and ingenious\" Cocea, were mounting an independent protest against \"bourgeois\" values.[13] They literary taste favored Symbolism, Parnassianism and literary naturalism, which they saw as modern shields against traditionalist culture.[12] Inspired by the works of Charles Baudelaire,[14] they soon joined efforts with the Romanian Symbolist movement. All members of the group visited with the Symbolist doyen Alexandru Macedonski,[12] although Cocea the writer was first discovered by Symbolist academic Ovid Densusianu and his Viea\u021ba Nou\u0103 review.[15]\n As his personal note, Cocea rebelled against paternal and institutional authority. Under the pen name Nely, he published the defiantly erotic novel Poet-Poet\u0103 (1898, with a preface by Galaction), that resulted in his near-definitive expulsion from public high school.[16] Around the same time, Galaction married Cocea's cousin Zoe Marcou, a laicized Romanian Orthodox nun; she would inspire him to become an Orthodox priest.[10]\n Around 1900, Cocea, who had already graduated in Romanian Law,[17] was in France, undergoing specialization at the University of Paris. At this stage in life, he was probably acquainted with the French roots of Romanian radical liberalism, which infused his left-wing outlook.[18] A sympathizer of the Dreyfusards, he was also becoming interested in the various projects to transform the Kingdom of Romania into a republic,[19] in marked contrast to his father's ardent monarchism.[5] He witnessed first-hand the progress of trade unionism in France, and had personal interviews with writer Anatole France and sculptor Auguste Rodin.[20] The family's French connections were preserved by the writer's siblings. Cocea's sister Alice, the future comedian, was born in Sinaia, where Dumitru Cocea was stationed in 1899, and also settled in France at a later date.[4] She was joined there by Cocea's younger sister, Florica.[4]\n Upon his return to Romania, Cocea was for a while employed as justice of the peace,[21] but was later virtually inactive as a lawyer.[17] Instead, he began frequenting the Romanian socialist milieu. He was at the time married to Florica Mille, daughter of Constantin Mille. Her father was founder of Adev\u0103rul daily and co-founder of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR). This was another break with the Cocea family tradition: allegedly, General Dumitru Cocea had once ordered his troops to devastate the Adev\u0103rul offices.[22]\n Florica was born from Mille's first marriage, which ended in divorce, and had a sister, Margareta, married into the Messerschmitt family of German industrialists.[23] Through Mille, Cocea became related to another Moldavian boyar family, the T\u0103utus.[2] Cocea's marriage, which resulted in the 1912 birth of Dina Cocea, was troubled and ended in divorce.[5]\n Like some of the veteran socialists (Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu, Henric Sanielevici, the Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare group), the young journalist made repeated attempts to revive and reunite the socialist clubs, left in disarray by the 1899 dissolution of the PSDMR.[24] Cocea, with Arghezi, Demetrius and Galaction, stood out for marrying this political ideal with the artistic credo of Symbolism. This unusual vision was preserved in the magazine the three published together during 1904, Linia Dreapt\u0103 (\"The Straight Line\").[25] In 1905, Arghezi left for Switzerland and entrusted Cocea with his collection of rare books. Cocea is said to have lost it, an event which marked the first of several disagreements between them.[26]\n With the March 1907 peasant uprising, N. D. Cocea's profile in political journalism was boosted. He is the probable source of a much circulated canard, taken up by Adev\u0103rul, according to which Romanian authorities had killed 11,000 or more peasant insurgents.[3][27] Cocea himself eventually settled for a death toll of 12,000, claiming that, \"had the peasants' bodies been lined up and down on Calea Victoriei\", Romanian King Carol I of Hohenzollern could have walked over to Dealul Mitropoliei \"on a soft rug of peasant flesh\".[27]\n During the actual events, N. D. Cocea was mainly active on the lower course of the Danube, recognized by other socialists as \"one of the leaders of the [workers'] movement\" in Br\u0103ila.[28] His regional daily, Dezrobirea (\"The Emancipation\"), was probably paid for by a local banker, Alphonse (or Alfons) Nachtigal.[17] Drawing official suspicion as a republican paper,[17] it became noted for fueling revolt regionally. After the Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare circle organized a socialist rally in Br\u0103ila, Dezrobirea's entire staff was arrested on orders from Prefect Nicolae T. Faranga, who also confiscated most of the printed issues (although some 1,000 were still freely distributed among the intrigued peasants).[29] Cocea was eventually tried as an instigator, and sentenced to a term in prison.[30]\n Upon his release, Cocea moved back to Bucharest, where he became a socialist orator, a Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare editor, and a correspondent of the workers' journal Viitorul Social.[28] He was one of the Romanian delegates to the International Socialist Congress, hosted by the Second International in Stuttgart.[31] It was there that Russian socialist opinion leader Vladimir Lenin publicized a thesis according to which the Romanian revolt and the Russian Revolution of 1905 were similar, in both character and impact.[27] Back in Romania, Cocea was resuming his contacts with Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who was by then all but withdrawn from active socialist politics. As Cocea later wrote, the veteran leader confessed to him that he was being brought down by acute insomnia.[32]\n The young activist was blending his socialism with a critic's interest in modern art and experimental literature. Literary historian Paul Cernat argues that, like Symbolist poet N. Davidescu, Cocea spent the 1900\u20131920 period disseminating modernist literature \"on all fronts\".[33] He made his name as an art critic by 1908, when, like Arghezi, he defended the Romanian post-Impressionist art club, whose members were being marginalized by the Tinerimea Artistic\u0103 society; he also saluted Iosif Iser's international post-Impressionist exhibit.[34] Within a series of articles in Pagini Libere journal, Cocea also explained his divorce with Symbolism and Art Nouveau, concluding that they represented \"the cosmopolitan class of sloth and of universal parasitism\".[35] The following year, Cocea was assigned the art column of Noua Revist\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, an eclectic journal put out by Romanian thinker Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru. While there, he militated in favor of modernized art, urging artists to destroy \"antiquated artistic formulas\" and to subvert \"the laws of nature\".[36]\n According to Cocea's future friend and foe Pamfil \u0218eicaru, 1910 was the time year Cocea, with Christian Rakovsky, Ecaterina Arbore, I. C. Frimu and Ilie Moscovici, was in the \"chief of staff\" of the newly created Social Democratic Party of Romania.[37] Cocea was additionally a member of the party's Social Studies Circle, furnishing its library and organizing its Kalinderu Church offices.[38]\n In February 1910, Cocea and Arghezi set up a new periodical, Via\u021ba Social\u0103. The magazine, which received contributions from Dobrogeanu-Gherea, militated for universal suffrage, social equality and land reform, while informing readers about world socialism.[39] It enlisted collaborations from a number of anti-establishment journalists, from agrarian militant Vasile Kog\u0103lniceanu and socialist physician Tatiana Grigorovici to writers Ion Minulescu, Lucia Demetrius or Constantin Graur, and republished contributions from some of Europe's known social critics: Eduard Bernstein, Rinaldo Rigola, Vsevolod Garshin, Leo Tolstoy, Jean Jaur\u00e8s, Emile Vandervelde, Hubert Lagardelle[17] and Gustave Herv\u00e9.[40] Other contributors were Arbore, Davidescu, V. Demetrius, Traian Demetrescu, Sofia N\u0103dejde, Vasile Savel and Avram Steuerman-Rodion.[41]\n Culturally, this moment saw Cocea and his friends coordinating the transition from Symbolism to the early 20th-century avant-garde.[42] This move was also accelerated by art critic Theodor Cornel, who was for while a staff writer for Cocea's publication.[43] In his first Via\u021ba Social\u0103 editorial, Cocea himself deemed Arghezi \"the most revolutionary poet\" of the period.[44] However, his unilateral decision to publish Arghezi's \"Evening Prayer\", as an example of poetic rebellion,[45] greatly enraged the expatriated author.[46] They resumed their friendship only after Arghezi returned from his Swiss sojourn, and Cocea, with Galaction, Dumitru Karnabatt and various others, frequented the salon formed in Arghezi's Bucharest home.[47] Cocea was also witness when Arghezi wedded his long-term lover, Constan\u021ba Zissu (December 1912); the register describes him as \"a journalist by profession, living at Polon\u0103 Street, 1.\"[48]\n Through Galaction's interventions, Via\u021ba Social\u0103 maintained links with the more mainstream and home-grown current on Romania's leftist scene, Poporanism, as well as with the post-socialist magazine of Ia\u0219i, Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103.[49] It also published several poems by the young Poporanist George Top\u00eerceanu.[50] Also in Ia\u0219i, the Via\u021ba Social\u0103 circle acquired a number of young disciples, involved in editing Fronda and Absolutio magazines: Isac Ludo, Eugen Relgis etc.[51]\n Still, traditionalist critic Ilarie Chendi notes, Via\u021ba Social\u0103 as a whole failed, because the Symbolist and post-Symbolist contributors were not ardent socialists, and because no \"notable poets or prose writers\" could be found among the socialists.[52] The same was observed in 1913 by critic Gheorghe Savul, who suggested that Via\u021ba Social\u0103 took on Symbolists such as Davidescu for opportunistic reasons, since they also had an anti-bourgeois axe to grind, but that there was little else to unite its contributors.[53]\n Cocea was by then frequenting the anarchist boyar Alexandru Bogdan-Pite\u0219ti, an art patron, cultural innovator and personal friend of Arghezi.[54] In 1911, he visited Italy together with Lagardelle, the French Syndicalist militant, and personally met with liberal theorists Benedetto Croce and Guglielmo Ferrero, as well as with Syndicalist Arturo Labriola and fellow journalist Giuseppe Prezzolini.[7] His travel account, which includes essays on art and civilization, was published the same year, as Spre Roma (\"Toward Rome\").[55]\n Back in Romania, Cocea launched Rampa, a theatrical review originally published as a daily. His partner in this venture was a veteran of theatrical life, Alexandru Davila.[56] Cocea also set up the independent socialist newspaper Facla. The latter, identified as Romania's first socialist and satirical magazine by Arghezi himself,[57] was soon joined by the 18-year-old poet Ion Vinea, as literary columnist and campaigner for post-Symbolist literature,[58][59] with painters Iser[60] and Camil Ressu[61] as illustrators. The other noted contributors to Cocea's publications were Toma Dragu, Saniel Grossman,[57] George Diamandy,[62] Camil Petrescu[63] and avant-garde critic Poldi Chapier, whose 1912 article for Rampa chronicled the international success of Futurism.[64] Also featured were poems and translations by the post-Symbolist H. Bonciu.[65] Cocea's own contributions include the chronicle of a play by Henry Bataille[66] and a salute to the \"invincible spirit\" of the Portuguese republican revolution.[67]\n Alongside renewed attacks on Romania's cultural traditionalism, Cocea and Arghezi initiated a lengthy campaign in favor of universal suffrage.[68] Their articles and headlines were often sensationalist and provoking, again focusing on Carol I, Romania's aging King. They often referred to the monarch as Plo\u0219ni\u021ba (\"The Tick\"), Ghe\u0219eftarul (\"The Shop-Keeper\") or Neam\u021bul (\"The Kraut\").[69] Facla, with media support from Adev\u0103rul and the Romanian anarchist milieus, was taunting the authorities by staging its own mock trial for l\u00e8se majest\u00e9.[69] Facla's anticlericalism, specifically aimed at the Orthodox Church, formed part of a larger scandal, which had earlier seen Arghezi giving up his hierodeacon's frock.[70] The ardent antimilitarism of Cocea's Facla articles, in particular his mockery of General Grigore C. Cr\u0103iniceanu and his sons, had similar results: the journalist was handed a preemptive and dishonorable military discharge.[71]\n Culturally, Facla was a leading adversary of traditionalist literature and of the nationalist periodicals which supported it. Its attack was concentrated on Drum Drept and Convorbiri Critice magazines (the focus of Vinea's articles)[72] and on antisemitic historian Nicolae Iorga, who had earlier dismissed Facla as a venue for Jewish Romanian interests.[73] Facla also inaugurated the conflict between Cocea and the Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 Poporanists. As a socialist, Cocea attacked the Poporanists for supporting artistic nationalism, and then for courting the mainstream National Liberal Party.[74]\n Cocea unsuccessfully presented himself as a Social Democratic candidate in the elections of 1912, the first ones in Romania to be contested by an independent socialist party.[75] However, he soon broke off from the party, and came to be considered a representative of the \"bourgeois press\" by his former socialist colleagues. One of them, Constantin Titel Petrescu, informs that Cocea \"could not live by the party discipline\".[76]\n At an early stage in World War I, public opinion in neutral Romania was divided between the Entente Powers and the Central Powers, both of which held Romanian irredenta. In this context, the Francophile Cocea manifested himself as an outspoken partisan of Romania's alliance with the Entente.[77] There followed a split between Cocea and his erstwhile partners Arghezi, Galaction and Bogdan-Pite\u0219ti. The latter three were committed Germanophiles who proceeded to publish their own review, Cronica.[78] Chemarea, a mainly political magazine published by Ion Vinea in 1915, stood between the two groups, but was probably managed by Cocea, who allegedly came up with its name (lit. \"the calling\").[79] Cocea's friendship with Arghezi had again soured to the point of mutual hatred. In Facla, Cocea made thinly veiled comments about the poet's mother, an unmarried woman, and suggested that the Cronica staff \"still lives on the morsels left over from Bogdan-Pite\u0219ti's feasts\".[80]\n When the 1916\u201317 Campaign turned into a defensive war, N. D. Cocea joined the government and Land Forces on their retreat to Western Moldavia. Reunited with Vinea, he helped publish a daily named De\u0219teptarea (\"The Awakening\"), flirting with the Germanophiles and Zimmerwald neutralists, hotly criticizing the Ententist and National Liberal establishment.[81][82] However, he remained an outspoken critic of those public figures whom he perceived as German hirelings, including politician Alexandru Marghiloman and Arena newspaperman Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo.[81] As was later acknowledged by Vinea, Cocea and his De\u0219teptarea colleagues had formed a conspiratorial \"revolutionary republican committee\".[83] Both of them were also affiliated with a wing of the Romanian Freemasonry.[84][85]\n A while after, Cocea made his way in the Russian Republic, Romania's Entente ally, and settled in Petrograd. His activities there included putting out the French-language magazine, L'Entente (\"The Entente\"), which was financed by his old rivals, the Romanian National Liberals.[86] As a resident of Hotel Astoria,[87] he witnessed first-hand the October Revolution, and became a passionate supporter of the Bolshevik cause. He later claimed to have been present, on Revolution day, in the Petrograd Soviet hall, hearing the victorious speech of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin,[88] and to have later attended the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets.[89][90] As a representative of the International Association for Information of the Labor Press of America, France, and Great Britain, Cocea exchanged notes with Lenin. He interviewed Lenin about the Bolsheviks' goals, assuring him that his replies would be published verbatim.[91]\n By the end of the year, Cocea had returned to Moldavia. Under his direction (December 1917 to February 1918), De\u0219teptarea became a new edition of Chemarea. It was often issued with large blank spaces, showing interventions by military censors.[81] The gazette managed to publish a letter of protest, signed by poet Benjamin Fondane, expressing a hope that Arghezi would not be prosecuted as a traitor.[92] After advertising its \"radical socialist\" agenda, Chemarea was promptly shut down by the Alexandru Averescu cabinet.[93] For this and other reasons, Cocea would later refer to Averescu as the organizer of \"White Terror\" in Romania.[94]\n Cocea was a strong critic of Romania's separate armistice with Germany,[81] and consequently listed as a persona non grata by the Central Powers.[95] In August 1918, he launched Depe\u0219a (\"The Dispatch\"), later published as a third edition of Chemarea. A new presence on these two periodicals was writer Jacques G. Costin, who produced several political pieces (including a renewed denunciation of Hefter-Hidalgo) and later the musical chronicle.[81][96] Its other staff writers were young men who later built career in the political press, both left- and right-wing: Vinea, Demostene Botez, Alexandru Busuioceanu, Cezar Petrescu, Pamfil \u0218eicaru[81] and Adrian Maniu.[17] They took care of the newspaper when Cocea left Ia\u0219i on a short visit to Bessarabia, a former Russian province that was in the process of uniting with Romania.[81]\n Victorious in its lengthy conflict with Hefter's Arena, Chemarea eventually relocated to Bucharest, but suffered from the nationwide paper shortage.[81] Cocea supported the Socialist Party of Romania (PS) through the leftist riots of December 1918, and, when the PS leadership was arrested, sat on the defense team, alongside Mille and Dragu.[97]\n Chemarea survived until November 1, 1919\u2014when its lampoon of Romanian King Ferdinand I prompted the intervention of military censors.[93] On November 2, shortly before the general election day, Cocea profited from the temporary suspension of censorship to reissue the same paper, subsequently renamed Chemarea Ro\u0219ie (\"The Red Call\"), then Facla, Tor\u021ba (\"The Torch\"), Clopotul (\"The Bell\") and again Chemarea (changes which were supposed to keep censors always a step behind Cocea).[98] These publications were attempts to revive and radicalize the socialist literary press, that had virtually succumbed in Romania after the demise of Facla's first edition. A Marxist literary critic, Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu, proposes that Cocea's renewed offensive missed the mark, lacking \"a clear enough vision\".[99]\n Cocea was elected to the Lower Chamber during the race of November 1919 (reelected during the race of May 1920). He represented a non-partisan electoral list for Bucharest (the Citizen's List), whose other two candidates, physician Nicolae L. Lupu and lawyer Constantin Costa-Foru, also won seats.[100] Although officially an independent, he rallied with the PS in the Chamber minority group led by Gheorghe Cristescu and Ilie Moscovici.[101] Cocea's mandate was immediately contested by his National Liberal adversaries. They sought to invalidate his candidature, citing a law which prevented those with a military discharge from running in elections. The National Liberal motion was however defeated when Cocea, who presented himself as a political victim, earned unexpected support from the Romanian National Party and the Democratic Nationalist Party.[102]\n In opposition to the People's Party and the anti-communist consensus, Cocea spoke positively in Parliament about Soviet Russia, arguing that the Bolshevik foreign policy had saved the whole of civilization, and citing favorable statements made by the returning war prisoners.[103] His theory was that the Comintern was a legitimate successor of the First International. The notion was contested by another socialist deputy, Dragu\u2014early signs of a schism between the Cominternist socialist-communists and those who followed the Vienna International.[104] In one of his addresses to the Chamber (July 28, 1920), Cocea presented a vision of socialism that was neither \"unilateral\" nor \"narrow\", but suited to the needs of \"all peoples and all times\", and quoted from The Internationale.[105] Cocea's rhetoric, equating the October Revolution with the birth of Christ and glorifying the Slavic soul, was ridiculed from the benches as \"Russian mysticism\".[106]\n For a while, Cocea's sympathy turned toward the rising Peasants' Party. This Poporanist group, which reacted against National Liberal politics and sought peace with the socialists and the Soviets, was called \"civilized and Westernized\" by the socialist journalist.[107] Nevertheless, Cocea was becoming disappointed by the parliamentary system of Greater Romania. He argued that Parliament itself should be replaced with a technocratic body, elected by a radical form of universal suffrage,[108] and clamored his belief that \"in short while, [...] Romania will be socialist.\"[94]\n In August 1920, Cocea voted in favor of Grigore Trancu-Ia\u0219i's labor law, although he found it unsatisfactory\u2014his stated belief was that the law's inequities would spark a \"social revolution\".[109] There followed the October 1920 general strike, that was condoned and supported by Cocea and the writers at Chemarea.[110] During December, following a state of siege, Cocea and Lupu were behind parliamentary efforts to investigate the alleged murder of socialist activist Her\u0219cu Aroneanu by People's Party authorities.[111]\n When, in early 1921, Cristescu and the other socialist-communists set up the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), Cocea became an outside sympathizer of their cause, protesting against their imprisonment and prosecution in the Dealul Spirii Trial.[112] In May and June of that year, when Chamber was assessing the case of Moscovici's seat, left vacant by his sentencing after the strike, Cocea asked for it to be filled by Constantin Popovici; Popovici, next on the electoral list, was himself under arrest.[113] His speech about \"government terror\" ended in a heated dispute with People's Party deputies Berlescu (whom Cocea called a descendant of Romani slaves) and Alexandru Otetele\u0219eanu.[114] Shortly before the 1921 election, Cocea labeled Conservative-Democratic leader Take Ionescu, the Prime Minister-designate, as a pawn of King Ferdinand and his \"camarilla\".[115] Early in 1922, Cocea also joined Dem. I. Dobrescu and other lawyers on the Dealul Spirii Trial defense team.[116]\n In 1920, Chemarea came to its end, and Cocea began putting out another edition of Facla weekly.[93] The newspaper acquired offices in the Frascatti Hotel (later the \"Savoy\" branch of Constantin T\u0103nase Revue Theater), redecorated by artist Marcel Janco.[117] According to political scientist Stelian T\u0103nase, this enterprise was secretly financed by Soviet Russia as external agitprop: notes kept by Siguran\u021ba Statului intelligence agency suggest that Cocea was a regular guest at the Russian mission in Romania.[3]\n Cocea's disciple, Ion Vinea, went on to publish the magazine Contimporanul, originally as a socialist tribune, but later as a modernist forum.[118] Cocea was an occasional contributor to this venue, but was separated from its avant-garde staff writers, having a less rebellious writing style and a more structured political vision.[119] In exchange, Vinea was an occasional contributor to Facla, whenever Contimporanul met financial difficulties;[120] he was also the editorial director from 1925 to 1926 (the year when Facla again closed down).[58][121] Vinea's own political articles were noted for their critique of National Liberal policies, portraying liberal Romania as a Br\u0103tianu family dictatorship and campaigning in favor of the socialist groups.[121][122] Around 1924, the Facla group was also joined by \"Red Prince\" Scarlat Callimachi, a modernist promoter and communist militant,[117] by aspiring critic \u0218erban Cioculescu,[123] and by the Zionist opinion maker A. A. Luca.[124] Cocea was at the time the animator of cultural debates at Terasa Otetele\u0219anu, where he introduced the young novelist and journalist I. Peltz.[125][126]\n The early 1920s also witnessed N. D. Cocea's involvement in various other civic and cultural campaigns. He became, in 1922, a member of the Romanian Friends of Nature, a socialist-inspired environmental organization, and, the following year, joined Dem I. Dobrescu in creating the League for Human Rights.[127] He was among the regular guests at International Red Aid \"literary tea parties\", described by historian Adrian Cioroianu as \"one of those schemes the communists employed in collecting money for their comrades in prison\".[127] With Fondane, director Armand Pascal and various others, Cocea also participated in creating Insula, an actors' working group. It was supposed to revolutionize Romanian theater, but disappeared after only a few months of existence (February 1923).[128] Cocea compensated by giving moral support to the Jewish modernist Vilna Troupe, which relocated to Bucharest in 1924.[129] Also that year Cocea published a new book, Ignoran\u021b\u0103 (\"Ignorance\").[130]\n After the adoption by a National Liberal legislature of Romania's 1923 Constitution, Cocea joined up with the angrier ranks of political opposition. He soon publicized a claim that King Ferdinand and his favorite minister, Br\u0103tianu, had together given legal foundations to a plutocracy.[131] He was taken to court and lost, being sentenced for l\u00e8se majest\u00e9.[3][17][131] Reputedly, the authorities also confiscated samples of Cocea's anticlerical fiction works, but these were recovered and published by Contimporanul in 1925.[132] Through the voice of Vinea, Contimporanul also protested the sentencing, claiming that Cocea was a persecuted man, his career \"a spectacle of modern dramatism\".[131] The trial attracted significant attention among the Romanian youth, which divided itself into monarchists and republicans.[124]\n Cocea's conduct was the topic of controversy throughout the early 1920s: in 1922, Cocea's influential modernist rival, the literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, bitterly attacked him, Arghezi and Bogdan-Pite\u0219ti for their wartime conduct.[54] Noted for its xenophobic attacks on Contimporanul's editors,[133] the nationalist review \u021aara Noastr\u0103 openly celebrated Cocea's arrest. An unsigned note in that paper announced that Cocea had been imprisoned \"for the least of his crimes\", and called to mind that Cocea had been lampooning its editor, Octavian Goga.[134] The antisemitic publicist Alexandru Hodo\u0219 designated Cocea's supporters at Adev\u0103rul and Cuv\u00e2ntul Liber with the title of \"Shabbos goyim\", describing Cocea as a habitual prankster, a renegade of the socialist cause, and a dishonorable man.[135]\n Cocea served his sentence of one year and a half at Craiova penitentiary, and paid the 10,000 lei fine.[3][17] He was afterward involved in communist agitation, speaking at PCR rallies in C\u00e2mpina (1925), Soroca and Otaci (during the electoral campaign of 1931).[17] The PCR underground's leaders were often Cocea's guests at Frascatti.[136] His modernist supporters did not follow his lead. By 1929, Vinea and Contimporanul were toning down their own socialist agenda, cooperating instead with the moderate National Peasants' Party, and even drawing suspicion from the left that they had become sympathetic to fascism.[137] Generally a critic of the National Peasantists,[7] Cocea quit a resurfacing Facla in 1930, leaving Vinea in charge (the latter was editor of that newspaper until its 1940 disestablishment).[58][121]\n Over the next few years, N. D. Cocea is believed to have been largely inactive in the political press.[138] Instead, he made his return to fiction. In 1931, his novel Vinul de via\u021b\u0103 lung\u0103 (\"The Wine of a Long Life\") was released under contract with Editura Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103.[130] Its received much acclaim, unmatched by Cocea's later works in the genre, which critics often found unpalatable for their erotic content.[139] Cocea's erotic series includes: Fecior de slug\u0103 (\"The Son of the Servant\"), published in 1933 by Cultura Na\u021bional\u0103; Pentr-un petec de negrea\u021b\u0103 (\"Over a Black Patch\", also known as Andrei Vaia), 1934, Alcaly Publishers; and Nea Nae (\"Uncle Nae\"), 1935, Alcaly.[130]\n During that interval, Cocea was again brought into custody. He was tried and imprisoned for statutory rape, having eloped with the 16-year-old Gina, orphaned daughter of the wealthy National Liberal politico Ion Manolescu-Strunga.[3] The liberties he took in public life, and the provoking nature of his writings, resulted in other disputes with the nationalists, forming part of their larger conservative crusade against \"pornography\" and the avant-garde. The traditionalist periodical Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc, put out by Nicolae Iorga, had \"Cocea Niculae\" on its blacklist, as the third most offensive Romanian author (the avant-garde authors H. Bonciu and Geo Bogza were at No. 1 and No. 2 respectively).[140] In parallel, Cocea was becoming involved in a publicized controversy with his wartime colleague Pamfil \u0218eicaru. As commentators have since noted, the two journalists were equally vulgar, but \u0218eicaru had been enlisted by the nationalists and the traditionalists.[3][141]\n In 1934, Cocea joined a group known as Amicii URSS, formed on the basis of a PCR initiative and formally seeking to normalize Romania's relations with the Soviet Union.[142] In November of that year, Siguran\u021ba Statului was reporting that Cocea and Callimachi, together with Petre Constantinescu-Ia\u0219i, were going to establish in Bucharest a \"far left platform\" with a \"pronounced Semitic tendency\"; known as Ideea Social\u0103 (\"The Social Idea\"), it was supposedly part of the Adev\u0103rul-Diminea\u021ba network.[143] The period also brought Cocea's brief and uneventful marriage with Lila St\u0103nescu. She was in reality the lover of PCR activist Ion Gheorghe Maurer, whom the journalist continued to view as his friend.[5]\n In 1936, the year when he married his long-time lover Gina Manolescu-Strunga,[5][7] Cocea again returned to the forefront of Romania's left-wing press, launching the theoretical magazine Era Nou\u0103 (\"New Era\"). Also a front for the PCR, replacing the banned Bluze Albastre of communist writer Alexandru Sahia, Era Nou\u0103 was itself shut down by the authorities in 1937.[144] It had published only two issues. In one of its internal memos, Siguran\u021ba Statului reviewed the first of these as inoffensively \"academic\", the second as \"agitatorial\".[17] Siguran\u021ba agents also noted that Cocea, with Dobrescu and Callimachi, was making efforts to assist the PCR activists tried in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and trying to obtain further support from the left-wing National Peasantists (Virgil Madgearu, Grigore Iunian).[143]\n Era Nou\u0103's main contributors were young communist essayists such as Sahia, Miron Radu Paraschivescu, \u0218tefan Voicu and Silvian Iosifescu, but the magazine also published avant-garde authors with Marxist sensibilities: Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru, Stephan Roll, Virgil Teodorescu, Dolfi Trost[145] and Paul P\u0103un.[146] They were joined by communist polemicists Ghi\u021b\u0103 Ionescu and Belu Zilber.[146] In its first issue, Era Nou\u0103 prophesied that the general crisis of capitalism was evident in the rapid decay of \"its culture and ideology\", leaving the proletariat in a position to reinterpret mainstream culture \"on the large basis offered by dialectical materialism\".[147] According to cultural historian Zigu Ornea, such pronouncements, soon taken up by the entire communist press, were in reality a form of left-wing totalitarianism, and therefore equivalent to the internal logic of fascism.[148]\n Cocea was reputedly pondering the relaunch of Chemarea as a communist newspaper, supposedly with \u0218tefan Fori\u0219, the ex-convict head of PCR Agitprop, as its manager, and Paraschivescu, Voicu, as well as other Communist Youth activists, as co-editors.[17] Siguran\u021ba men had it that Cocea shocked his communist partners by informing them that Chemarea was to be a \"centrist\" platform, with no known communist on its staff.[17] However, the senior socialist remained active in proximity to the PCR over the next year. In May 1937, he caught Siguran\u021ba's attention as a would-be collaborator to Callimachi's anti-fascist review Munca (\"The Labor\"). Making overtures toward the National Peasantist left-wingers, Munca also received contributions from poets Mihail Cruceanu and Sandu Tudor, from sociologist Mihai Ralea and journalist Tudor Teodorescu-Brani\u0219te, and from writer-director Sandu Eliad.[143] In summer 1937, the moderate left-wing Azi daily published Cocea's renewed criticism of censorship, part of a series of a collective reply to the far right's moralistic discourse.[149]\n Cocea was again mandated by the PCR to lead Reporter weekly, beginning with its November 1937 issue. The periodical, already in existence for five years, was making efforts to reach the apolitical public.[150] In an editorial for Reporter, Cocea made comments similar to the Era Nou\u0103 program, with a more pronounced satirical tone and allusions to fascism: \"however massive the stupidity of dictatorial rules, man's intelligence, honesty in convictions [and] the fervor of the masses will in the end topple them. [...] The greedy satraps, the leeward adventurers have come to tumble down, one on top of the other.\"[151]\n Reporter's agenda was generically anti-fascist: campaigning for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, it lampooned Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and repeatedly attacked the Iron Guard or other Romanian fascist groups.[152] Its political panelists included, alongside Voicu, Paraschivescu and C\u0103lug\u0103ru, the future communist historian Ion Popescu-Pu\u021buri, reporter Aurel Baranga,[153] and anti-fascist poet Gherasim Luca.[154] Other members of the Reporter circle, whose contacts with Cocea were closely investigated by the authorities, included a diverse gathering of PCR figures: Fori\u0219, Trost, Marxist sociologist Lucre\u021biu P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu, unionist Ilie Pintilie[3] and the Bessarabian poet Emilian Bucov.[155] Reporter also published the militant poems of Demostene Botez, Liviu Deleanu and Al. \u0218ahighian, and samples of international left-leaning literature (Ilya Ehrenburg, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Nikolai Ostrovsky).[156] The maverick dramatist Mihail Sebastian was, for a while, Reporter's literary chronicler.[157]\n Only two months after Cocea took over, Reporter was banned by state censorship, suspected of \"communist tendencies\" and of publishing \"alarmist articles.\"[3] The sincerity of Cocea's political credo was by then coming into question: the maverick communist Petre Pandrea alleged that Cocea was infiltrated into the party ranks by Siguran\u021ba Statului.[125] Stelian T\u0103nase also describes Cocea as a double agent, notoriously close to Siguran\u021ba director Mihail Moruzov (his Bucharest neighbor), trafficking in information from the communist movement and the court of Carol II, but still advising PCR Agitprop.[3] Cocea was nevertheless being closely watched by the Siguran\u021ba Detective Corps. It kept notes on his meetings with French press correspondents, with Spanish Republican diplomats and with disgraced Jewish Romanian journalists such as Jacques G. Costin.[3] According to these documents, Cocea discussed political matters with the opponents of Carol II, including National Peasantist Iuliu Maniu and communist sympathizer Petru Groza.[3] He is known to have had great sympathy for Maniu, despite their political differences.[158]\n A 1939 entry in Cocea's own diary admits that the \"unexpected\" Non-Aggression Treaty between the Soviets and Nazi Germany was the source of \"doubting\" and \"bitterness\" among left-wing Romanians, but scolds his old friend Nicolae L. Lupu for having then lost faith in socialism.[159] At times, he was openly critical of Joseph Stalin and his personality cult, writing about the \"sickening smoke of official Soviet incense\", and joking about the various feats attributed to Stalin.[160] In contrast to his earlier political stances, Cocea was, by 1938, a member of the National Liberal Party, probably because a new wave of repression had led the PCR to implode.[161] He was registered with the National Liberals until after Carol II's National Renaissance Front dictatorship pushed them into semi-clandestinity, and still enjoyed a privileged relationship with them during World War II.[161]\n Cocea was inactive during the war, when Romania was allied with the Axis Powers and under a succession of dictatorial regimes. Around 1939, he was separated from his wife Gina, following a series of disagreements in the family.[3][5] Inhabiting a private villa in the Transylvanian town of Sighi\u0219oara, he kept diaries which offer insight into his various political dealings. During the Winter War, he sided with the Soviet Union, noting that Stalin had pragmatic grounds for wanting to secure his borders. However, he viewed Soviet provocations as \"redolent of Nazism\", and concluded that the war would impose new \"problems of conscience\" on all \"good-faith people.\"[162] The fascist National Legionary regime continued to keep track on Cocea's movements during 1940, alarmed by rumors that he had been operating a clandestine printing press, but was unable to determine whether he was still a communist.[3] Cocea's actress sister Alice, who was living in Nazi-occupied France, was taking a different path: she and her manager, Robert Capgras, had a friendly relationship with the Germans and were later deemed collaborators with the enemy.[4][163]\n From 1941, the Nazi-aligned regime of Conduc\u0103tor Ion Antonescu ordered Romania's participation in the war against the Soviet Union. Cocea was active in the informal opposition to Antonescu, approaching his old friends in the mainstream political parties. As early as January 1942, Cocea met with the National Peasantist leadership, probing its attitude toward the Soviet Union and the Romanian communists. Like them, Cocea was positively impressed that the PCR was turning into a \"patriotic\" party and going back on its pro-German stance.[158] Around 1944, Cocea resumed contacts with the since-revived PCR. In June, Siguran\u021ba reported that he was rounding up support for communist sympathizer Mihai Ralea and his underground Socialist Peasants' Party.[143] He later served as the communists' liaison with the National Liberal Party wing of Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu (later, the National Liberal Party-T\u0103t\u0103rescu). Cocea's intervention contributed to a strategic alliance between the communists and the various other parties, within a coalition which overthrew Antonescu (see King Michael's Coup).[89]\n In September 1944, Cocea was elected Vice President of the Romanian Writers' Society, which was in the process of expelling writers associated with the wartime regimes.[164][165] He personally proposed for some 50 \"valuable writers\", from Maria Banu\u0219 and Ury Benador to Radu Tudoran and Gheorghe Zane, including many of his left-wing friends, to be admitted into the Society (only 20 of them were eventually received).[164] The following month, he participated with Callimachi in the creation of a formally unified Journalists' Trade Union. Split between PCR and National Peasantist lobbies, it was created around the conjectural goal of purging the Romanian press of fascist influences.[166] The Union was originally presided by a Committee comprising Cocea, Callimachi, Nicolae Carandino, Miron Constantinescu, George Iva\u0219cu, Eugen Jebeleanu, Octav Livezeanu, George Macovescu, Nicolae Moraru, Ion Pas, Grigore Preoteasa, Tudor Teodorescu-Brani\u0219te, Alfons Vogel and several others.[167] In May 1945, Cocea represented the Writers' Society at the funeral of his Reporter colleague Mihail Sebastian, who had been killed in a road accident.[168]\n The Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS), which offered a good reception to Soviet occupation forces, counted N. D. and Dina Cocea among its earliest members (although they were probably not among its founders); in December 1944, father and daughter were co-opted on the ARLUS Leadership Committee.[169] The ARLUS Press Section, headed by Teodorescu-Brani\u0219te, had Cocea as one of its first vice presidents, serving alongside Ion Pas.[127] Around 1946, Cocea approached Arghezi with a PCR offer to become a paid communist writer. According to his own classified report for the party, he was unable to persuade his former friend to join him in this cause.[3] Cocea's various efforts still earned praise from official poet Mihai Beniuc, who included his colleague among the writers most active in disseminating communist principles after August 1944.[170] According to T\u0103nase, Cocea \"offered himself to the Soviet occupier, with the same amoralism and cynicism that have been following him through life.\"[3]\n Between 1944 and 1946,[19] Cocea was also editor and publisher of Victoria (\"Victory\") daily. Although nominally independent, this paper was a tribune for the PCR, supporting the policies of communization, and popularizing Stalinism.[171][172] It fostered a new generation of journalists and activists, among them Vera C\u0103lin,[173] B. Elvin,[174] George M\u0103rg\u0103rit[175] and Marius Mircu.[176] Other Victoria contributors, including Iosifescu, Constantin Balmu\u0219, the avant-garde writers Radu Boureanu and Geo Dumitrescu, wrote articles which condemned the various traditional seats of learning and the Romanian Academy, as \"reactionary\", while naming the senior far right supporters in culture (from Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u0219ti and D. Caracostea to P. P. Panaitescu and Ion Petrovici).[172]\n On March 31, 1945, Cocea replaced the disgraced Carandino as Inspector-general of the Romanian theaters, and began introducing communist censorship.[177] In September 1947, a few months before the Romanian communist regime officially took over, Cocea was reelected to the Writers' Society Leadership Committee.[164] Together with Ion Pas, the Minister of Arts, he introduced legislation that severely curtailed the Romanian dramatic repertoire. It was largely impractical, causing an uproar in the theatrical community, and leading to Cocea's demotion in December 1947.[178]\n On January 9, 1948, Cocea was made Vice President of the reformed Writers' Society (later Writers' Union of Romania), alongside Galaction, G\u00e1bor Ga\u00e1l and Al. \u0218ahighian (Zaharia Stancu was the President, Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru the General Secretary).[165] He died the next year at his home in Sighi\u0219oara, shortly after a spiritual crisis had brought him back into the Romanian Orthodox Church.[7]\n N. D. Cocea had a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle, a favorite topic of gossip and urban legends. In his recollections, fellow journalist Constantin Beldie alleged that Cocea once owned a summer pavilion frequented by debauched young women, a veritable \"seraglio\".[179] A writer named Bogdan Amaru noted in autumn 1934 that \"Nicu D. Cocea always walks around with two girls on his arms. The women sense in him the writer who is at all times willing to render them immortal with the tip of his pen.\"[180] However, the intelligence agents keeping Cocea under surveillance during the 1930s and '40s collected rumors according to which their target was a homosexual.[3] The \u021aara Noastr\u0103 polemicists also claimed that Cocea's pederasty was a matter of public record.[134]\n Cocea's marriages and relationships resulted in four children: Tantzi, Dina, Radu and Ioana-Maria (also known as Maria Cocea).[5] Florica Mille, who was his first wife, left him for his many affairs with younger women, even though, Dina Cocea recalls, she was forever fascinated by his intellect.[5] After the 1920 divorce, Cocea is said to have lived with a Maria[3] or Zoe Grigorescu.[7] Tantzi, who was born to him from this relationship (1909),[3] was the first wife of Liviu Ciulley (father of the award-winning filmmaker Liviu Ciulei).[181] The writer's second marriage, to Lila St\u0103nescu, was allegedly one of convenience,[5] and he was at the time still in a physical relationship with Gina Manolescu-Strunga, the reason for his statutory rape trial. Their affair continued even after Gina married art critic Petru Comarnescu, and she was carrying Cocea's child when that marriage was annulled.[5][182][183]\n The daughter, Ioana-Maria, was later recognized by Cocea, and earned her artistic reputation as a sculptor;[2] through her mother, she was related to the Ghica family and to the banker Iosif Pincas.[5] Like Comarnescu before him, Cocea became disenchanted with Gina and was repelled by her public persona: his diaries contain sarcastic comments on her supposed lack of principles and na\u00efvete, calling her Gina Balamuc (\"Madhouse Gina\").[5] After parting with Cocea, Gina was married to communist journalist Ghi\u021b\u0103 Ionescu (later known as an anti-communist academic, relocated to England).[5] In the 1940s, while in Sighi\u0219oara, Cocea had as a mistress Ioana Mosora, who was more than 40 years his junior.[3][5][7] One of his final projects was to educate Ioana, the daughter of impoverished peasants,[3][5] on art and literary history.[7]\n According to literary historian George C\u0103linescu, Cocea was only devoted to \"the cause of the proletariat\" in his public life: \"in his most intimate life, an aristocrat, worshiping the established order and the supreme factor.\"[7] The anticlerical journalist was always troubled by the matters of belief and organized religion. In Spre Roma, Cocea confesses about having piously knelt in front of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, and about finding the arguments of Roman Catholic preachers to be almost irresistible.[7] Cocea was still active in the Romanian Freemasonry: he stood by the dissident Masons who pledged allegiance to Grand Masters George Valentin Bibescu and Grigore C. Grigoriu; from 1945, he was himself a Deputy Grand Master.[85] Reputedly, it was him who advised Grigoriu and Mihail Noradunghian to send this Masonic Lodge into \"sleep\", as a means to preempt communist suppression.[184] In old age, he rediscovered Romanian Orthodoxy. He made arrangements for his parents to be reburied in Sighi\u0219oara, recognized all his illegitimate children, and, on his death bed, demanded to be buried with an Orthodox service performed by his old friend Galaction.[7]\n Beyond public cultivation, the Cocea\u2013Galaction\u2013Arghezi collaboration was tinged by malice and unresolved conflict. Cocea himself divulged Arghezi's private anti-communism in his 1946 report to the PCR overseers, recording that Arghezi rejected recruitment offers with sarcasm and pride.[3] Arghezi's own private notes, and some of his published lampoons, contain some biting remarks about Cocea's communist career.[185][186] In a 2005 interview, Galaction's daughter Elena also stated that her father had only remained in contact with Cocea because of Cocea's kinship with Zoe Marcou-Galaction; the family, she claimed, mistrusted and feared Cocea, whom Zoe herself likened to the devil, but whose conversation skills they all found irresistibly entertaining.[186]\n In George C\u0103linescu's definition, Cocea was \"more of a yellow journalist than a talented one\".[7] Reviewing Fecior de slug\u0103 for G\u00e2nd Rom\u00e2nesc magazine in October 1933, cultural journalist C. Pastia sarcastically commented that Cocea's lampoons had \"taught boys how to curse\", in which action he identified the Cocea's lifelong objective.[138] Similar assessments were later passed by other authors and researchers. Paul Cernat described Cocea the pamphleteer as \"feared\" and \"vitriolic\",[20] while Stelian T\u0103nase summarized his writing as \"sharp, polemical and vulgar\".[3] Likewise, critic Mihai Zamfir calls Cocea's republican pamphlets \"filthy\", accusing them of promoting, together with the \"stupid little poems\" of the much older Alexandru Vlahu\u021b\u0103, a distorted image of the Romanian monarchy.[187] Stelian T\u0103nase also notes that Cocea resorted in blackmail, just like his ex-pupil turned rival Pamfil \u0218eicaru, but that he was less interested than \u0218eicaru in accumulating fortunes.[3] Cocea himself was vexed by \u0218eicaru's style. In his definition, it was the literary equivalent of \"postilion curses\".[141]\n The harsh pronouncements on Cocea's journalistic contributions are nuanced or contradicted by other writers and critics. Scarlat Callimachi spoke of his comrade, the \"feared polemicist\", as in reality \"a good man\" of \"amazing generosity\", and, stylistically, \"a poet\": \"Even in his most violent articles one finds glimpses of true poetry.\"[117] The latter trait, Callimachi assessed, survived no matter how hard Cocea trained himself to repress it.[188] Cocea's skill was emphasized by his foe, Comarnescu, who believed Cocea to be a \"semi-failure\" as an intellectual, but also a \"joker\" of genius.[183] According to Pastia: \"no one in Romanian literature has ever speculated paradox with as much courage and talent.\"[138] Writing in 1936, the young Facla essayist Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco (later a world-famous playwright), listed Cocea and Arghezi among the \"peaks\" of an older generation, as Romania's two \"greatest lampoonists\".[189] Various other authors have also seen in Cocea a founding figure of the more satirical and politically aware side of modern Romanian humor.[190]\n Cocea's youthful debut with Poet-Poet\u0103 was his homage to Symbolist prose poetry, colored with a strongly erotic tinge. According to George C\u0103linescu, the book, \"vehemently priapic and monotonous in its excess\", borrows its tone from Alexandru Macedonski, its titillating subject from Pierre Lou\u00ffs, and its plot from Mihai Eminescu (the novel Cezara).[7] The protagonists of Poet-Poet\u0103, Iulius and Ersilia, living on love and desire, discover each other's bodies and then the joy of dying of one's own volition, hurling themselves off a precipice.[7] Writing in 1911, Ilarie Chendi noted that the book was Cocea's first known blunder, speculating that literary failure had relegated Cocea to the promotion of other, more talented, Symbolists.[52]\n C\u0103linescu sees the positive aspect of Poet-Poet\u0103 in its \"delicate description\" of the human form (Ersilia's hair, for instance, is stof\u0103 f\u0103r\u0103 pre\u021b, \"priceless fabric\").[7] Fellow literary historian and critic \u0218tefan Cazimir has included Cocea's work among the Symbolist novels directly influenced by Vienna Secession art and the Secessionists' feminization of nature.[191] Such traits also stand out in Galaction's biblical preface, a new Song of Songs: \"Ersilia's eyes are as green as the depths of the ponds at Heshbon; and her breasts like twin does grazing among the lilies.\"[7] These interventions were held against Galaction by literary historian Eugen Lovinescu (an outspoken adversary of the Via\u021ba Social\u0103 writers): \"A militant Orthodox, [Galaction] prefaced in his youth novels which defile all things sacred\".[192]\n In 1908, when he castigated both Symbolism and \"perverted eroticism\", Cocea left a detailed list of authors he considered \"degenerate\" and \"bourgeois\": Gabriele d'Annunzio, Dumas-fils, Maurice Maeterlinck, Anna de Noailles, Georges Ohnet, Marcel Pr\u00e9vost, and Oscar Wilde.[193] According to literary historian Angelo Mitchievici, the substance of such \"class-based criticism\" was equivalent to the biological determinism of Cocea's nationalist adversaries, announcing the absolutes of fascism (\"degenerate art\") and communism (the Zhdanov Doctrine).[194]\n Vinul de via\u021b\u0103 lung\u0103 is considered by some to be Cocea's main work as a novelist.[195] The main character, Manole Arca\u0219, is, like Cocea himself, a Moldavian boyar. Successive episodes in the book reveal his complex worldview: Arca\u0219 is an atheist with modernist sensibilities, a lover of nature, and a utopian socialist who has been turning his estate into a commune.[196] Having reached a venerable age, he slowly reveals the secret of his longevity in conversations with the much younger judge: after decades of experimentation, the Arca\u0219 estate produces a special sort of Moldavian wine; the grapes were pressed by Manole and a Romani (Gypsy) girl, in the course of their love-making.[197] The object of Arca\u0219' olfactory fetish, the girl has died a tragic death, inspiring Manole to take up the winery project as a sort of symbolic rebirth.[198]\n With its aesthetics and its tone, Vinul de via\u021b\u0103 lung\u0103 is an unusual sample of militant literature, contrasting with the work of socialist or Poporanist writers from Cocea's lifetime. French historian Bernard Camboulives notes that Cocea made a point of reacting against Poporanists' call to preserve \"Romanian specificity\".[195] Similarly, George C\u0103linescu notes that the Poporanist setting is given an original twist in Cocea's novel, with the erotic interludes.[7] As Callimachi writes, the book is a rare moment in which Cocea the poet vanquished Cocea the journalist,[188] while Camboulives sees in it \"a eulogy to life, to love, to the senses and to the most elevated thoughts\".[199] In C\u0103linescu's more skeptical interpretation, it merely stands for \"a journalistic narrative, with the stylistic decency of well-read men\", its author being less than a \"creator\", its dialogues just \"chatter\".[7]\n During the interwar period, Cocea could at times register significant success, but it was largely owed to the scandalous nature of his novels. The issue was taken into consideration by C\u0103linescu, who referred to Cocea's \"exaggerated, but explainable\" popularity.[7] C. Pastia also suspected Cocea of pulling a prank, \"leaving the impression that he had dedicated himself to literature\" in Vinul de via\u021b\u0103 lung\u0103, and then returning to the political stage with novel-lampoons.[138] Cocea also found critics among his fellow modernists: writing in 1935, modernist critic Lucian Boz created a separation between the \"pornographic novels\" of Cocea or D. V. Barnoschi, which \"have orgasm as their goal\", and the controversial but \"brave\" literature of James Joyce.[200]\n Fecior de slug\u0103, the first of Cocea's political novels, takes its artistic inspiration from the fin de si\u00e8cle novelist Duiliu Zamfirescu, creator of the social climbing prototype Dinu P\u0103turic\u0103.[201] Cocea's Dinu is T\u0103nase Bojogeanu, the \"son of the servant\" referred to in the book's title. As a child, he is shown competing in school with Nelu Azan, the daydreaming aristocrat, profiting from Azan's generosity and overtaking him in many respects.[202] However, while Nelu preserves ideals which lead him into the communist movement, T\u0103nase, the corrupt clerk, rises through the ranks to become King's Commissioner.[7] The two are pitted against each other, their ideological conflict made worse when Bojogeanu sells a young female communist into sexual slavery.[7]\n Present throughout the work are masked portrayals of Cocea's political allies and adversaries. Pastia, who described such cameos as both cartoonish and interesting, identified Alexandru Averescu, Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, I. C. Frimu, Dumitru Iliescu-Turtucaia, Take Ionescu, Nicolae Iorga and some others.[203] Pastia also suggests that the central theme (Bojogeanu as the bourgeois suffocating ancient boyardom) is conventional and ultimately irrelevant: \"That may well be, and we agree that our morals may tolerate the decay of the Azans and the ascent of the Bojogeanus. But this did not a novel make. An issue of Facla would have sufficed.\"[204] C\u0103linescu spoke with displeasure about Fecior de slug\u0103 as an illustration of Cocea's \"strident, violent style, excessively vulgar and of a sexuality that is never redeemed by a hint of whatever is eternally human.\"[7] Pastia however found that Cocea wrote his book with noticeable talent \"in rendering that which is vulgar\", a Romanian answer to Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal.[204]\n Pentr-un petec de negrea\u021b\u0103, with its name borrowed from peri-urban Romanian folklore,[179] shows its male protagonist Andrei Vaia alternating between dreams of free love in the countryside and the adulation of Bucharest as a hotspot of erotic pursuits. Of the adventures depicted, some are believed to have been modeled on Cocea's own sexual exploits.[3][179] A pivotal moment in the novel shows Andrei discovering that his Bucharest lover, Mira, is cheating on him with the hunchback Bergher, who has purchased her attentions with stockings and silk.[179] Through Vaia's monologues, the book gives Cocea's views about the female psyche and bodily needs, the supposedly eternal insecurity of men, and the mystery of female orgasm.[179] Pentr-un petec... doubled as a barely disguised satire of the interwar political class, in this case specifically directed at the National Peasants' Party\u2014according to C\u0103linescu, this was Cocea's selling tactic, as were its advertised depictions of \"fornication\" and \"sexual abnormalities\", or its licentious quotation from the Book of Proverbs.[7]\n In Nea Nae, the eponymous protagonist is a boorish and thick potentate, always on the hunt for \"beastly erotic pleasures\" (C\u0103linescu), sometimes accompanied by thinly disguised political figures of the interwar.[7] C\u0103linescu was especially critical of Nae's speech patterns, caricatured \"without the gifts of the picturesque\".[7]\n Cocea greatly influenced the journalistic style of young Ion Vinea[121][122][205] and Scarlat Callimachi.[117] In addition to his presence in the memoirs or diaries of his friends and enemies, Cocea is the republican revolutionist in Cronic\u0103 de familie (\"Family Chronicle\"), by the communist writer Petru Dumitriu\u2014a text allegedly plagiarized from Vinea's unpublished works.[83] Among the better-known visual portrayals of Cocea is a 1928 ink drawing by Marcel Janco.[206]\n Some of N. D. Cocea's writings enjoyed a good standing throughout Romania's communist period. During the early 1960s, official textbooks described him as one of those who covered the gap between 19th-century Realism and Romanian Socialist Realism.[207] In particular, the communist regime overplayed Cocea's criticism of the Romanian monarchy, glorifying him as someone who had undermined the credibility of Michael I and his predecessors.[69][187] In one instance, communist historiography even claimed that Cocea and Arghezi had served time for their 1912 anti-monarchy campaign, taking Facla lampoons at face value.[69]\n Cocea's World War II diaries were passed on to his relatives in Switzerland, and have not been published except for the short fragments hosted in the 1960s by two Romanian reviews: Magazin Istoric[3][208] and Secolul XX.[90] The former only featured redacted portions, communist censors cut out Cocea's critique of Soviet foreign policy, which were rendered sensitive by the recent intervention in Czechoslovakia, and also excised his thoughts on the Stalin cult.[208] In 1970, an edition of Cocea's Jurnal (\"Diary\") was issued by the PCR's Editura Politic\u0103.[159] A previously unknown novel by Cocea was signaled in the late 1970s, and was noted for its virulent attacks on Pamfil \u0218eicaru.[141]\n Cocea's literature and political controversy were also publicized outside Romania. From his refuge in Francoist Spain, \u0218eicaru made public his decades-long polemic with Cocea. His repeated talk about Cocea's immorality prompted literary historian Nicolae Manolescu to note a paradox: \"It is somewhat strange to see accusations of immorality being launched by people who, beyond their talent [...], do not even possess the most basic moral sense. The mere fact that the pamphlets they hurl at each other, like hogwash, have morality as their stake (never their own, always the other's), should make one think.\"[141] A French-language translation of Vinul de via\u021b\u0103 lung\u0103 was published by Jean de Palacio (Le Vin de longue vie, Le Serpent \u00e0 Plumes, 2000).[209] According to Romanian literary critic Mircea Iorgulescu, the positive reception of such works in France \"would probably astound the Romanian literary environment, for whom Cocea hardly even exists.\"[210]\n Streets named after Cocea exist in Bucharest, Sighi\u0219oara, Bra\u0219ov, Oradea, Sibiu and Timi\u0219oara. His residence in Sighi\u0219oara is preserved by the local authorities as a \"memorial house\".[211] The same city is home to the N. D. Cocea Literary Club, established 1979.[212]\n", " Zim Ngqawana (25 December 1959 \u2013 10 May 2011[1]) was a South African flautist and saxophonist.  He was later known as Zimology.\n The youngest of five children, Ngqawana started playing flute at the age of 21, eventually becoming proficient on alto, tenor and baritone saxophone as well. He dropped out of school prior to meeting university entrance requirements but won entrance to a place at Rhodes University. He later studied for a diploma in Jazz Studies at the University of Natal. He was offered scholarships to the Max Roach/Wynton Marsalis jazz workshop and later a scholarship to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied with jazz musicians Archie Shepp and Yusef Lateef.\n After his return to South Africa in the 1990s Ngqawana worked with South African jazz musicians Hugh Masekela and Abdullah Ibrahim. He collaborated with Bjorn Ole Solburg on the Norwegian San Ensemble album, San Song. On that album he wrote two songs, \"San Song\" and \"Migrant Workers\". He toured the United States with his band \"Ingoma\" in 1995, and he made an appearance at Black History Week in Chicago.\n He performed a duet with poet Lefifi Tladi in the documentary Giant Steps (2005), directed by Geoff Mphakati and Aryan Kaganof. In January 2010, Ngqawana's Zimology Institute was vandalised by scrap metal thieves. He performed a duet concert in the rubble of the vandalised building with Cape Town pianist Kyle Shepherd. This performance was filmed as The Exhibition Of Vandalizimiop by Aryan Kaganof. The Vandalizim concerts were subsequently performed at the MOMO Gallery in Johannesburg and at a scrapyard in Stellenbosch, organised by Stellenbosch University's music department and DOMUS.\n Ngqawana suffered from stroke during a rehearsal and was taken to Helen Joseph hospital and succumbed from bleeding on the brain. He is survived by his wife and five children. [2][3]\n", " The Walton primo RX5 is a new smartphone from Walton Group one of most famous mobile phone brands in Bangladesh.

This contrasts with parenteral nutrition or drug administration (Greek para, \"besides\" + enteros), which occurs from routes outside the GI tract, such as intravenous routes. Enteral administration involves the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines (i.e., the gastrointestinal tract). Methods of administration include oral, sublingual (dissolving the drug under the tongue), and rectal. Parenteral administration is via a peripheral or central vein.[1] In pharmacology, the route of drug administration is important because it affects drug metabolism, drug clearance, and thus dosage. The term is from Greek enteros, \"intestine\".\n Enteral administration may be divided into three different categories, depending on the entrance point into the GI tract: oral (by mouth), gastric (through the stomach), and rectal (from the rectum). (Gastric introduction involves the use of a tube through the nasal passage (NG tube) or a tube in the belly leading directly to the stomach (PEG tube). Rectal administration usually involves rectal suppositories.)\n The mechanism for drug absorption from the intestine is for most drugs passive transfer, a few exceptions include levodopa and fluorouracil, which are both absorbed through carrier-mediated transport. For passive transfer to occur, the drug has to diffuse through the lipid cell membrane of the epithelial cells lining the inside of the intestines. The rate at which this happens is largely determined by two factors: Ionization and lipid solubility.[2]\n Factors influencing gastrointestinal absorption:\n Drugs given by enteral administration may be subjected to significant first pass metabolism, and therefore, the amount of drug entering the systemic circulation following administration may vary significantly for different individuals and drugs. Rectal administration is not subject to extensive first pass metabolism.\n", " The 1989 Atlantic 10 Conference Baseball Championship was held at Bear Stadium in Boyertown, Pennsylvania from May 12\u201314.

The names of these two tribes were Chok or Chuk which is the name for a short sword like implement, and Sekker which means 'cowrie shells' Their territory was \"on the Elgeyo Escarpment\" and while they lived on the Elgeyo escarpment the Kerio Valley was occupied by the Sambur. \"..If ever the Suk descended from their fastness, they were raided and harried by this tribe\".[2]\n The Chok were a \"purely agricultural people, cultivating millet and eleusine grain grown in the cold air of the summit and possibly a little tobacco.\"[3] The \"millet [was] grown on the fertile and well watered flats at the base of the Elgeyo escarpment, and [was] watered by means of irrigation, while eleusine grain (was) grown high upon the hill sides and was dependent on rain\". The irrigation system as Beech noted, \"is most ingenious, and its original construction must have required a vast amount of toil and patience\".[4]\n The Chok had two notable industries, pottery and iron-smithing, the former performed by women and the latter by men.[5]\n The significance of the Chok smithing industry is illustrated in a tradition captured among the Nandi in the early 20th century. There the smiths said in regard to their ancestors arrival in Nandi; that a man named Arap Sutek had been the only smith in the country then but that after the Uasin Gishu Maasai quit their homes and split up in different directions, some of those who wandered into Nandi were hospitably received by Arap Sutek and by the early 20th century every clan had a smith. \n There was also a sword in use among the Nandi by then known as rotuet-ap-chok (sword of/from Chok) which was being manufactured alongside the previous rotuet that had been made in Nandi.[6] It is possible though not clear that the Chok had exported these weapons prior to this time.\n The Chok obtained donkeys from the Turkana and it would appear they took a number with them to Nandi but were obliged to get rid of them as it was felt that they would spoil the grazing for cattle.[7]\n The most noted item of their culture was the Chok from which they got their name. Beech notes that as of 1911 it was only women he saw carrying these swords \"...on their way to the grain fields\".[8]\n A custom unique to the Chok was the payment of dowry in palm wine or honey.[9]\n Samburu traditions describe their relationship with the Pokot as one of inter-ethnic lang'ata i.e. a close yet circumspect bond best perceived as a friendship born as a resolution to past conflict.\n The Samburu place the oath beyond living memory, and with many knowledgeable Samburu informants giving detailed oral history going back to at least the 1880s it is likely that this relationship was established with the Chok.\n Certain traditions state that the oath was renewed around the time when the Merisho age-set were murran (in the early 1900s) indicating a renewal of the oath following the assimilation of the Chok into Pokot identity.[10]\n The Chok were raided by the Laikipia Masai forcing some of them to flee to Kapukogh in Uganda.[11]\n The Nandi smiths narrative identifies their ancestors who arrived from the Uasin Gishu plateau with a sword known as rotuet-ap-chok (sword of/from Chok) as the Uasin Gishu Maasai.[6] Similarly immigrants from their neighboring community (i.e. the Sekker mentioned by the Pokot elders) were known as the Segelai Maasai.[12]\n Chok traditions recall their territorial expansion under their new identity, they remember that a time came when \"... there arose a wizard among the Suk who prepared a charm in the form of a stick, which he placed in the Loikop cattle kraals, with the result that they all died.\" \n After defeating the Loikop, a settlement was established at En-ginyang (about 48 kilometers north of Lake Baringo), likely by a group of Pokotozek.[13][14] This event signified the establishment of the pastoral Chok, i.e. Pokot, community.[11]\n With the Pokot community established, a desire arose many Chok to adopt pastoralist culture. The aim and ambition of every agricultural Chok became to amass enough cattle to move into the Kerio Valley and join their pastoral kin.[11] They achieved this through attaining cattle as the bride-price of their female relations or through adoption, in the latter case, poor Chok youth would be adopted by members of the emerging Pokot community primarily as herds-boys.[15]\n By the early 20th century, the Pokot community was expanding as many of the Chok joined their rank and by that time, many Pokot who were termed Suk by the colonial administrators did not recognize this name for their tribe.[8]\n", " \n\nThe Projecta was an English automobile manufactured only in 1914 at the Percival White Engineering Works, Highbury, London.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 384.[1]  It lies on the B1176 road, 4 miles (6\u00a0km) south from Corby Glen and 6 miles (10\u00a0km) north from Stamford .\n The East Coast Main Line railway cuts through the eastern side of the village over viaducts. On the edge of Little Bytham to the east is the West Glen River. Further east lie Witham on the Hill and Grimsthorpe Castle estate. To the west is Castle Bytham and, over the Rutland county boundary, is Clipsham. Careby is just to the south.\n The name 'Bytham' is first recorded in 1067 (as a monastery that rapidly translated to Vaudey Abbey), and comes from the Old English word bythme meaning Valley bottom, broad valley.[2]\n The church is a Grade I listed building. It is dedicated to two 6th-century French saints, St Medard and St Gildard (or Medardus and Gildardus); the dedication is unique in the UK. Virtually unknown in Britain, St Medard is still well known in France, with at least 25 towns or villages named after him (as St M\u00e9dard or St M\u00e9ard).[3] Gildard, thought to be his brother, is less well known.[4] The village f\u00eate is held annually on or near St Medard's feast day, 8 June.\n The earliest parts of the building are some Anglo-Saxon \"long-and-short\" stonework, visible externally at the southeast and southwest corners (quoins) of the nave. The church also has several Romanesque details dating from the Norman era, including a Priest's Door (\"uncommonly ornate\", according to Nikolaus Pevsner) with a finely carved tympanum; the empty circular niche in the tympanum is said to have held a relic; the birds in roundels to either side are probably eagles, as one is legendarily supposed to have sheltered Medard from the rain [1]. Also Norman are the plain, undecorated arch into the tower, and the north door (late 12th century).[5]\n The south aisle and the upper parts of the tower and spire are 13th century work; the intersecting tracery of the east window of the south aisle shows that it is slightly later, dating from around 1300, as does the nearby piscina. The chancel arch is probably also from the late 13th century, and the double piscina in the chancel may be of a similar age. The Easter Sepulchre in the chancel is in the slightly later (Decorated) style, but is a fairly crude example.[5] A finely sculpted capital depicting a Green Man surrounded by oak leaves, similar to examples at nearby Kirkby Underwood[5] and Greatford, also dates from c.1300.[5] It is no longer in position, having been built into a wall, face inwards, and rediscovered during later restoration work.[6]\n The stone base of the pulpit is dated 1590, and has a Latin inscription Orate et parate (\"Pray and prepare\").[6] Pevsner mistakenly gives this as Orate et Arate.[5]\n The Great Northern Railway main line (now the East Coast Main Line) and the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (closed 1959) crossed here. The GNR had powers to make a junction but never did so. Little Bytham railway station on the GNR closed in 1959, and most of its buildings have since been demolished. There was no station here on the M&GNJR, the nearest being Castle Bytham railway station. From 1857 to 1884, Little Bytham station was the junction for the Edenham & Little Bytham Railway branch line to Edenham.\n Remains of the M&GNJR and E&LBR are still visible, most obviously near the junction of the road from Little Bytham to Witham on the Hill, where there is a large M&GN embankment with a road bridge across the B1176 52\u00b044\u203250\u2033N 0\u00b029\u203240\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff52.7473\u00b0N 0.4944\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.7473; -0.4944\ufeff (Little Bytham - M&GN embankment) and a river bridge across the River Glen within a quarter of a mile 52\u00b044\u203252\u2033N 0\u00b029\u203229\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff52.7478\u00b0N 0.4914\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.7478; -0.4914\ufeff (Little Bytham - Bridge over River Glen), with an E&LBR cutting and road bridge a little further up the hill 52\u00b044\u203245\u2033N 0\u00b028\u203257\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff52.7459\u00b0N 0.4825\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.7459; -0.4825\ufeff (Little Bytham - E&LBR cutting) to the east.\n The LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard locomotive made its record-breaking run south through the village on 3 July 1938. It reached 126\u00a0mph (202.7\u00a0km/h), the fastest ever officially recorded for a steam locomotive just south of the village at milepost 90\u00bc, where a sign beside the track was erected in 1998 to mark the 60th anniversary of the event, and the exact spot (between Aunby and Carlby) in Lincolnshire where The Mallard reached its highest speed.[7][8]\n In 1933 a trial return run between London and Leeds was made with modified A1 locomotive number 4472, Flying Scotsman on the return trip with 6 coaches weighing 208 tons it attained 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) just outside Little Bytham in Lincolnshire for just over 600 yards (550 m).[28] There were earlier claims to this speed, notably by the Great Western locomotive 3440 City of Truro, but this 1933 run is generally considered to be the first reliably recorded instance. On a later trial run to Newcastle upon Tyne and back in 1935, A3 number 2750 Papyrus reached 108 miles per hour (174\u00a0km/h) hauling 217 tons at the same spot, maintaining a speed above 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) for 12.5 consecutive miles (20.1\u00a0km), the world record for a non-streamlined locomotive.[citation needed]\n A brickworks north of the village, established in 1850 and active into the early 20th century, made small, high-fired paving bricks, called \"Adamantine Clinkers\" (because of their hardness), for paving stables and other floors.

It is part of the larger body of Catholic social teaching, which traces its origin to Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum.\n It had become customary for popes to publish new writings on social issues at ten-year intervals since Rerum novarum, in order to keep the teachings relevant to the current times.  Laborem exercens was written in honor of the 90th anniversary, and makes reference to Rerum novarum and to several of the subsequent writings.\n The pope was not able to issue the document on the May 15 anniversary because of the assassination attempt two days earlier.[1] He published Laborem exercens a few months later, in September 1981.\n Some of the trends mentioned by John Paul within the encyclical are:\n Not mentioned in the encyclical, but surely in John Paul\u2019s mind as he addressed the question of work, was the foundation of Solidarity, an independent trade union with strong Catholic roots, in his native Poland in 1980.  John Paul knew Lech Walesa, Solidarity\u2019s founder, and had met with him more than once during a homecoming visit in 1979.[2]\n Laborem exercens begins with a scriptural argument that work is more than just an activity or a commodity, but an essential part of human nature.\n Work was not a result of Adam\u2019s sin, but was given to humanity from the moment of creation.  John Paul draws from this passage the conclusion that work is essential to human nature, and that \"man is the subject of work.\"\n Man has to subdue the earth and dominate it, because as the \"image of God\" he is a person, that is to say, a subjective being capable of acting in a planned and rational way, capable of deciding about himself, and with a tendency to self-realization. As a person, man is therefore the subject of work.[4]\n John Paul makes a distinction between work and toil.  Work is an integral part of human nature;  while toil, according to Genesis, was a consequence of sin.  The two cannot be separated now, but we can still find the uplifting and fulfilling aspect of work, which John Paul names industriousness.\n God's fundamental and original intention with regard to man, whom he created in his image and after his likeness (cf. Gen 1:26-27), was not withdrawn or cancelled out even when man, having broken the original covenant with God, heard the words: \"In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread\" (Gen 3:19). These words refer to the sometimes heavy toil that from then onwards has accompanied human work.... And yet, in spite of all this toil\u2014perhaps, in a sense, because of it\u2014work is a good thing for man.... through work man not only transforms nature, adapting it to his own needs, but he also achieves fulfilment as a human being and indeed, in a sense, becomes \"more a human being.\"[5]\n In the modern world there are many situations that tend to degrade the dignity of work.  John Paul called these \"threats to the right order of values.\"  For example, when work is treated as a product to be sold, or when workers are considered as an impersonal \"work force,\" then humans are being treated as instruments, and not as the subject of work.[6]  Other violations of dignity include unemployment; under-employment of highly skilled workers;  inadequate wages to support life;  inadequate job security;[7]  and forced labor.[5]\n John Paul recognized technology as a great benefit, provided it is regarded as a tool and not as a master.  However, technology also presents some risks.\n Understood in this case not as a capacity or aptitude for work, but rather as a whole set of instruments which man uses in his work, technology is undoubtedly man's ally. It facilitates his work, perfects, accelerates and augments it. It leads to an increase in the quantity of things produced by work, and in many cases improves their quality. However, it is also a fact that, in some instances, technology can cease to be man's ally and become almost his enemy, as when the mechanization of work \"supplants\" him, taking away all personal satisfaction and the incentive to creativity and responsibility, when it deprives many workers of their previous employment, or when, through exalting the machine, it reduces man to the status of its slave.[8]\n In Laborem exercens, John Paul set forth the following basic priorities as a framework for discussing issues of labor, capital, and property ownership:\n For contrast, he named two ideas he considered to be errors:  materialism and economism.  Materialism subordinates people to property;  while economism regards the value of human labour only according to its economic purpose.  John Paul recommends instead a philosophy of personalism.\n The person who works desires not only due remuneration for his work; he also wishes that, within the production process, provision be made for him to be able to know that in his work, even on something that is owned in common, he is working \"for himself\". This awareness is extinguished within him in a system of excessive bureaucratic centralization, which makes the worker feel that he is just a cog in a huge machine moved from above...[10]\n In a modern work-space it becomes very complex to establish ownership rights.  Natural resources must be acknowledged as gifts of God, belonging to all.  Any tools or technology used builds on prior work by countless generations, and continue to be influenced by those who use them in the present day.\n If it is true that capital, as the whole of the means of production, is at the same time the product of the work of generations, it is equally true that capital is being unceasingly created through the work done with the help of all these means of production, and these means can be seen as a great workbench at which the present generation of workers is working day after day.[11]\n Based upon this view, John Paul proposed a flexible and dynamic view of ownership and economics, and commended arrangements in which workers share in the ownership, such as shareholding by workers, joint ownership, and profit-sharing.\n John Paul examined the rights of workers in the context of a broader picture including both direct and indirect employers.  A worker\u2019s direct employer is \"the person or institution with whom the worker enters directly into a work contract\".  Indirect employers are other persons, groups and structures that affect or constrain the direct employer.\n The concept of indirect employer includes both persons and institutions of various kinds, and also collective labour contracts and the principles of conduct which are laid down by these persons and institutions and which determine the whole socioeconomic system or are its result.... The indirect employer substantially determines one or other facet of the labour relationship.[12]\n As one example, John Paul mentions manufacturing companies in developed countries that purchase raw materials from less developed countries.  If the purchasers insist on the lowest possible prices, the workers in another part of the world are indirectly affected.  To create labor policies that ensure justice for every worker, it is necessary not only to work with the direct employers, but also to identify and coordinate the indirect employers.\n John Paul suggests that this work properly belongs to governments as well as to international organizations such as the United Nations and International Labour Organization.\n \"We must first direct our attention to a fundamental issue: the question of finding work, or, in other words, the issue of suitable employment for all who are capable of it.\" The problem is not a lack of resources\u2014\"conspicuous natural resources remain unused\"\u2014but poor organization.  The criterion of full employment will only be achieved through planning and coordination among all the indirect employers, and a better coordination of education with employment.[13]\n John Paul proposed a family wage, i.e. enough to support the worker and his family, as a minimum.  Women with children have a right either to stay home, or to work outside the home with accommodation for their family responsibility.  He also recommended benefits including health insurance, pensions, accident insurance, weekends and vacations as part of a \"correct relationship between worker and employer.\"[14]\n John Paul re-asserted the importance of workers forming unions.  This right is not limited to industrial workers, but belongs to every class and profession.  He urges unions to view their struggle as a positive struggle for social justice, rather than a struggle against an opponent. He affirmed the right of unions to strike\u2014\"This method is recognized by Catholic social teaching as legitimate in the proper conditions and within just limits\" \u2014 but \"the strike weapon\" is an extreme means that should rarely be used.[15]\n The pope asserted the dignity of agricultural workers, and some particular difficulties and injustices they face.  These include greater isolation;  hard physical toil;  inadequate wages, benefits, and training;  and oppression of those who actually cultivate the soil by wealthy landowners.  \"In many situations radical and urgent changes are therefore needed in order to restore to agriculture\u2014and to rural people\u2014their just value as the basis for a healthy economy, within the social community's development as a whole.\"[16]\n Persons with disabilities have the same rights as other workers: \"The disabled person is one of us and participates fully in the same humanity that we possess.\"  The pope acknowledged costs and other barriers, but believes these can be overcome when communities work together with worker\u2019s rights being a priority.[17]\n John Paul expressed concerns about the phenomenon of people who emigrate, either permanently or seasonally, in search of work:\n Each country should have laws to protect the rights of immigrant workers, so that they receive equal treatment.\n Laborem exercens concludes with a section regarding the importance of work to Christian spirituality.  John Paul encouraged the Church to develop and teach a spirituality of work.[19]  He suggested the following components of this:\n Curran, Charles E.

Ramdoss is an Indian film director, screenwriter and actor who has worked on Tamil films.[1]\n Ramdoss was born in Villupuram to freedom fighter Ethirajalu Pillai and Poongavanam. As a youngster, he regularly watched films and during his time in college, he developed an interest in screenwriting. He later moved to Mylapore, Chennai in late 1979, attempting to make a career in the Tamil film industry where he became acquainted with then budding film maker Manobala, who was his neighbour. Manobala introduced him to film personalities including T. K. Mohan, for whom Ramdoss first wrote a song for in the unreleased film Karadi (1980).[2] Ramdoss then worked with director P. S. Nivas on his first screenplay, and was given the writing credits for Enakkaga Kaathiru (1981) which starred Suman and Sumalatha. After working with Nivas, Ramdoss moved on to collaborate as an assistant director to Manivannan for six films, before moving on to work for producer Kovai Thambi for Motherland Pictures. The success of several of Thambi's films meant that he offered Ramdoss an opportunity to make his directorial debut through Aayiram Pookkal Malarattum (1986) which starred Mohan and Seetha in the lead roles. Despite a publicised fallout between the producer and the original music composer Ilaiyaraaja, the film became a success commercially. His next film Raaja Raajathan (1989) featured Ramarajan and Gouthami in the lead roles, and also did well at the box office.[2]\n Failing to get opportunities to work with bigger stars, Ramdoss next made two films with actor Mansoor Ali Khan, by helming the action drama Ravanan (1994) and the political satire, Vaazhga Jananayagam (1996). He also later got the opportunity to direct a portion in the multi-starrer Suyamvaram (1999), which was shot within 24 hours, and was made in charge of filming the track between Pandiarajan and Kasthuri.[2] Apart from his credits as director, Ramdoss often collaborated with other film makers as a writer and contributed to films including Makkal Aatchi (1995) , \"Sangamam\"  and Kanda Naal Mudhal (2005). He later began to get opportunities as an actor following his role as a ward boy in Vasool Raja MBBS (2004). He has since appeared as a police officer in Yuddham Sei (2011), Kakki Sattai (2015), Visaranai (2016), Dharma Durai (2016) and Vikram Vedha (2017) amongst other projects.[2][3][4][5][6]\n", " Coordinates: 53\u00b025\u203212\u2033N 2\u00b058\u203219\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff53.420\u00b0N 2.972\u00b0W\ufeff / 53.420; -2.972\n Everton Park in Everton, Liverpool, England is a modern park created in the early 1980s on Everton Hill between Great Homer Street and Everton Road/Heyworth Street.\n The park features the Everton Park Nature Garden.\n", " The 1998 Finnish Cup (Finnish: Suomen Cup) was the 44th season of the main annual association football cup competition in Finland.

Beveridge has concluded that this theme owes its origins to Dvor\u00e1k's spurning by his pupil Josefina Cermakova, which occurred at approximately the time that Dvor\u00e1k was writing this symphony and which the composer was prompted to recall by the plot of the opera.[1]\n A typical performance of the work has a duration of about 50 minutes.\n The work is scored for two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings.\n \n", " \n Thomas Huschke (born 29 December 1947) is a retired East German cyclist.

He won a silver team medal in 1972 and an individual bronze medal in 1976, whereas his team finished in fourth place in 1976.[1] Between 1970 and 1975 he won one gold, three silver and two bronze medals in these two events at world championships.[2]\n As a road racer, he finished third in the Tour of Belgium in 1972 and won one stage of the Peace Race in 1973.[2]\n After retiring from competitions he received a degree in economics, and later briefly worked as a marketing expert of the East German Gymnastics and Sports Association.[3] In 1988 he was manager of figure skater Katarina Witt.[4] From 2004 to 2006 he was chairman of the Frankfurter Cycling Club.[5]\n His grandfather Adolf and father Gerhard were both competitive cyclists.[1]\n", " The Noble-Kendall House, also known as Kendall Place, is a historical residence located in Albia, Iowa, United States. Alvis E. Noble was a local businessman and contractor who operated a concrete block factory. He and his wife Cordelia had this house built after their previous house was destroyed in a fire.  Completed in 1907, it was built with concrete block, which was an unusual building material for residential construction at the time.[2]\n This Neoclassical-style house is also associated with Nathan E. Kendall.  He was a local attorney who became a politician. A Republican, he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1899, and served as Speaker of the House during the 32nd and 32nd extra sessions. From 1909 to 1913 he served the United States House of Representatives representing Iowa's 6th congressional district.  Because of health concerns, he pulled out of the 1912 race and returned to Albia to practice law.  He and his wifer Belle bought his house in 1916.  Kendall was then elected the 23rd Governor of Iowa in 1920, and served two terms.  Ill health plagued his second term.  The Kendall's remained in Des Moines after he was governor, eventually living in the home he bought from his colleague Senator Albert B. Cummins.  The Kendalls donated their house in Albia to the Albia Woman's Club. From that time it has been known as \"Kendall Place\", and it has been used as a club house and community meeting center.  Nathan Kendall had his cremated remains buried on the lawn of Kendall Place in 1936.[2]  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]\n", " \n Cymindis humeralis is a species of ground beetle in the subfamily Harpalinae.[1] It was described by Geoffory in 1785.[1]\n Cymindis humeralis can reach a length of 7.5\u201310.5 millimetres (0.30\u20130.41\u00a0in).[2]\n This species is present in most of Europe (Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Macedonia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Ukraine) and in the East Palearctic ecozone.[3]\n This xerophilous ground beetle lives in calcareous grasslands, heathlands and in the edges of forests.[2]\n Illustration from Calwer's K\u00e4ferbuch\n \n", " Francis Viel\u00e9-Griffin (May 26, 1864\u00a0\u2013 November 12, 1937), was a French symbolist poet.

His roles at the Met included Oroveso, Raimondo, Ferrando, Fiesco, Padre Guardiano and Alvise. A performance of Don Giovanni with Pasero singing Leporello and Ezio Pinza singing the Don was broadcast in 1932.  Unfortunately, no recording exists of this performance.\n Pasero notably sang the role The Miller in the world premiere of Umberto Giordano's Il re on 12 January 1929 at La Scala. He also enjoyed considerable success in such Wagner roles (sung in Italian) as Heinrich, Marke, Pogner, Hagen, Gurnemanz. Pasero appeared, too, in the title part in Modest Mussorgsky's Boris and participated in the first performances of several other operas, notably, Mascagni's Nerone, in Milan, and Pizzetti's Orseolo, in\nFlorence.\n In 1950, when only 58, Pasero abandoned the stage.\n Pasero was widely regarded as having one of the finest basso voices of his era, ranking on a par with those of his acclaimed compatriots Fernando Autori, Nazzareno De Angelis and Ezio Pinza. Indeed, the voice of Pasero closely resembled that of Pinza in terms of its range, size and exceedingly vibrant tonal qualities.\n Pasero's reputation for high-quality singing is borne out by his recorded legacy, which includes recordings of five complete works, available on CDs: Norma (recorded in 1937), La forza del destino (1941), Un ballo in maschera (1943) and Aida (1928 & 1946). Also released on CD are extracts from a performance of Aida from 1937; unfortunately, all of Act IV is missing.  Also available on CD is a recording of Verdi's Requiem from December 1940, but again only in extracts.  During the 1920s, '30s and '40s, he also made many impressive recordings of individual arias from operas by Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, Ponchielli and several French composers. Made originally for the Fonotipia, Columbia, Cetra and HMV labels, many of these 78-rpm discs have been re-released on CD in recent times by Preiser and other firms.\n After retiring from the stage, Pasero dedicated his time to teaching.

NAPA developed as a requirement under the UNFCCC to access funding for the most urgent and immediate adaptation needs from the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF).\n In Nepal, NAPA developed with three components: Preparation and dissemination of NAPA documents, development and maintenance of the Nepal Climate Change Knowledge Management Centre (NCCKMC), and development of the Multi-Stakeholder Climate Change Initiative Coordination Committee (MCCICC).\n In NAPA, nine integrated projects have been identified as the urgent and immediate national adaptation priority. They are:\n NAPA\u2019s implementation framework envisages that the operating costs will be kept to a minimum and at least 80% of the available financial resources will reach the local level to fund activities on the ground. Stakeholders in Nepal has also started discussing National Adaptation Plans(NAPs), which are medium and long term adaptation plans for the country as decided by UNFCCC.[1]\n The effects of green house gases (GHGs) on both drought and flooding events have been found, including severe winter drought[2] and excessive monsoon flooding.[3]  Climate change has been alarming in the context of global warming. In Nepal, 95% of green house gas emissions from agriculture and forestry sectors were 77% from forestry sector only.[4] The consequences of global warming have had the most impact in developing and mountainous countries like Nepal, which has high intensity rainfall during the rainy season. It has resulted in heavy floods, landslides and soil erosion. It is also common to find drought in many parts of Nepal that comes from the impacts of climate change and impacts sectors like forest, water resources, agriculture, human health and biodiversity in Nepal.[5] Likewise, altogether 14 glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs)[6] have happened between 1935 & 1991 in Nepal. In total, 21 GLOFs[7] have been identified as being potentially dangerous at present. In this way, CC and livelihoods integral part and have vice versa relationship. The low income & subsistence users are about 38% of total population Nepal lies below the poverty line have hard time to afford for their livelihoods in Nepal. That is a great challenge to cope with climate change induced hazard & extreme events. The livelihoods of more than 80% local people of hilly region are heavily depending on climate sensitive area such as agriculture, forest and livestock and on other natural resources such as water & irrigation.\n Response to climate change in Nepal has been growing in recent years with an effort to cope with the changing situation and build resilience capacity into adaptation to climate change. In climate induced vulnerability context, Nepal developed policy level provision regarding to adaptation policy called National Adaptation Programme of Action to climate change (NAPA).[8]  The NAPA document opened the door to act adaptation activities into country. Under the provision of national level policy, Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) national framework [9] devised out by government. It only mentioned the provision of the implementation mechanism at district or village development committee  level to act climate change adaptation. However, this document is still silent to provision of implementation mechanism at community level. Though there are still silent to act adaptation implementation mechanism at community level, some community level adaptive strategies are being implemented as community based adaptation plan for poor & vulnerable communities and who have less capacity to cope with disaster and are more dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods.\n Adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector and allied sectors is a major current and future challenge for Nepal. The majority of the population is still dependent on highly climate-sensitive agriculture. In recent years, long drought spells during the monsoon season and increased temperatures and unseasonal heavy rains during winter have caused serious distress to agriculture-dependent communities in many locations. If the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of ending poverty, achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture are to be realised, climate change adaptation interventions need to be implemented in earnest.[10]\n After 3\u00a0decades of CF in Nepal, more than 1.652\u00a0million forest lands handed over to 1.45\u00a0million households of 17685 community forest user group (CFUG)[11] to conserve, manage and utilization . CFUG as a common property resource management program in Nepal have resulted in improving forest cover and condition.By institutionally, Community forest user group is autonomous, independent and accountable institution for conserving, managing and utilizing of natural resources in Nepal legitimized by Forest Act 1992 and Forest Regulation 1995 of Nepal.\nThe additional advantages are as effective protection, wise use of resources, plantation, forest fire control, and more effective contribution to local development and economic generation. It enhanced biodiversity, water flow and soil stability. More than 90% of villagers report that their forests are in better condition than a decade ago. Furthermore, CFs are able to meet poor & vulnerable household's daily subsistence needs for forest products such as firewood, fodder, & timbers. Apart from this, growing forests capture and store carbon that are contributing to both mitigation and adaptation to CC. Because of, user groups have institutionally developed after CF handed over. Furthermore, the landscape of hills of Nepal drastically transformed into greenery.[12] Such types of changes have positive impact on carbon sequestration which has contributed in reducing effects of climate change.\n It is not only the CF contributing in climate change adaptation by providing goods and services, the CFUGs have also been used as local institutions for adaptation planning.[13]\n Traditional top-down decision-making processes have become inadequate, due to their inability to create appropriate solutions for local communities. Nepal's forest cover, condition and quality are being improved. This is the success of only through three way partnership such as communities from bottom-up function, government & donor from top-down function and NGOs, civil society network from outside-in. In this situation, CFUGs have to be involved in mainstreaming to implement climate change adaptation. It is due to they are playing the key role in proactive in investing their funds, climate change knowledge transfer and policy feedback to adopt to the impact of climate change. Policy shall be emphasized the establishing groups around the resources that are indispensable for the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable groups to access diversification opportunity. It is necessary to bridge this gap; bottom-up approaches may produce the best results by building on local experiences and knowledge. For this, building-up the capacity of groups and their poor and vulnerable communities on climate change mitigation and adaptation is pertinent.

She was the second last abbess in Sweden and Vadstena Abbey after the reformation.\n Katarina Bengtsdotter Gylta was the daughter of riksr\u00e5d and nobleman Benkt Pedersson Gylta (d. 1520) and Brita Bengtsdotter Lillie (d.1560) and the sister of riksr\u00e5d Bengt Gylta (1514\u20131574) and the historian J\u00f6ran Gylta. Her paternal aunt and her paternal grandfather were both members of Vadstena Abbey. Katarina Bengtsdotter Gylta was described as well educated and could speak Latin as well as Swedish.\n She was elected abbess in 1553. She lost the position in 1564, but was elected for a second term already the year after, and after that, she kept the position until her death. Her period of office was longer than any other abbess before her, and also a turbulent period for the abbey.    Vadstena Abbey had been allowed to remain after the reformation, but not without conflict.    In 1555, the male section of the abbey was closed and the monks was ordered to leave.    In 1567, the abbey was plundered by Danish soldiers during the Northern Seven Years' War.    The year after, the number of nuns at Vadstena are counted as 18.    The abbey was, however, still benefited by many private benefactors: in 1568, she received large donations from Queen Karin M\u00e5nsdotter and J\u00f6ran Persson during the illness of Erik XIV of Sweden.\n During the reign of King John III of Sweden, the abbey was favored by the royal house and Katarina Bengtsdotter Gylta maintained a good relation to the King and the Queen, Catherine Jagellon.     It is described how she used to talk to the King while they walked in the convents gardens, where he held her under the arm due to her infirmity.     In 1575, the Vadstena Abbey was granted unlimited permission to receive novices again, which had been difficult since the reformation.    In 1580, Gylta wrote to the Pope to ask for assistance, a letter which is still preserved.    In the letter, she expressed her concern that there was at that time only one convent left in Sweden except for the Vadstena Abbey, that the nuns had been forced to do without the monks for thirty years and that there were only two Catholic priests left in the abbey, both crippled with age.\n It is likely that it was due to the Queen that the Vadstena Abbey was visited by a cardinal of the Pope, Antonio Possevino, whom Gylta received later the same year.    The abbey was during his visitation reformed according to the latest regulations of the Catholic Church, and Katarina Bengtsdotter Gylta and her prioress swore the Tridentian oath from 1564.    In 1587, she hosted the monarch and Crown Prince Sigismund, and during their visit, the first great Catholic mass since the reformation was held. In 1592, a school for Catholic priests was founded in the abbey by Anders Magnusson.\n She died, as it was said, full of concerns for the future of the abbey.\n", " The European Educational Research Association (EERA) is an association of national and regional associations representing educational researchers in Europe. EERA aims to encourage collaboration amongst educational researchers in Europe, promote communication between educational researchers and international governmental organisations and disseminate and highlight state-of-the-art findings of educational research, primarily through the annual European Conference on Educational Research (ECER) and its associated journal, the European Educational Research Journal (EERJ).\n EERA was founded in June 1994 as a result of discussions among many national educational research associations and several major research institutes throughout Europe which identified the need for a European association to foster the exchange of ideas amongst European researchers, promote collaboration in research, improve research quality and offer independent advice on educational research and policies to European and national policy-makers, administrators and practitioners.  From 1994 to 2007, EERA was constituted as a Charity under British Law and based in Glasgow, Scotland. Since 2008, EERA has been operating from its new office in Berlin, Germany, and is constituted as a non-profit organisation under German Law.\n EERA aims to encourage collaboration amongst educational researchers and their respective associations in Europe. It promotes communication between educational researchers and international governmental organisations, such as the EU, Council of Europe, OECD and UNESCO. Furthermore, EERA seeks to disseminate the findings of educational research and to ascertain that the contribution of educational research to policy and practice is recognized and desired.\n EERA is constituted as an association of associations (i.e. there are no individual members). Its membership is made up of more than 30 national and regional Educational Research Associations from all parts of wider Europe.\n EERA is governed by Council and the Executive Board].\n The Executive Board is made up of the President, the Treasurer and the Secretary General who are elected for a four-year term:\n 2016: \n Council consists of the representatives of the member associations and the co-opted Council members \u2013 the Networks\u2019 Representative on Council, the editor of EERJ and the Convenor of the Emerging Researchers' Group.\n The academic work of EERA and especially the ECER conference is organised in networks.

The municipality is located in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is located on the south eastern edge of the Ruhr area, 15\u00a0km south of Dortmund, where the rivers Lenne and Volme (met by the river Ennepe) meet the river Ruhr. As of 31 December 2010, the population was 188,529.\nThe city is home to the FernUniversit\u00e4t Hagen, which is the only state funded distance education university in Germany. Counting more than 67,000 students (March 2010), it is the largest university in Germany.[2]\n Hagen was first mentioned around the year 1200, and is presumed to have been the name of a farm at the junction of the Volme and the Ennepe rivers. After the conquest of Burg Volmarstein in 1324, Hagen passed to the County of Mark. In 1614 it was awarded to the Margraviate of Brandenburg according to the Treaty of Xanten. In 1701 it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.\n After the defeat of Prussia in the Fourth Coalition, Hagen was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Berg from 1807\u201313. In 1815 it became part of the new Prussian Province of Westphalia.\n The growth of the city began in the 19th century with the mining of coal and the production of steel in the Ruhr Area. Hagen was the scene of fighting during the Ruhr Uprising, 13 March - 2 April 1920 and has a monument to the Ruhr Red Army.[citation needed]\n In 1928, Hagen developed into a city of more than 100,000 inhabitants.[citation needed]\n During World War II, Hagen was bombed repeatedly, by both the Royal Air Force and the Eighth Air Force. On the night of 1 October 1943, 243 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitoes from the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command attacked the city. According to the Bomber Command Campaign Diary, \"This raid was a complete success achieved on a completely cloud-covered target of small size, with only a moderate bomber effort and at trifling cost.\"[citation needed]  Hagen sustained severe damage from that raid, and hundreds of civilians were killed.\n After World War II, the town became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia.[citation needed]\n Owing to the extensive use of water power along the rivers Ruhr, Lenne, Volme and Ennepe, metal processing played an important role in the region of Hagen in and even before the 15th century.[citation needed]\nIn the 17th and 18th century, textile and steel industries as well as paper production followed.[citation needed]\n Hagen is the home of the Suedwestfaelische Industrie- und Handelskammer, as well as Sparkasse Hagen, the local municipal savings bank.

The inception of this institution in the city dates back to 1824.\n Hagen is home to the LWL-Freilichtmuseum Hagen, or Hagen Westphalian Open-Air Museum, a collection of historic industrial facilities where trades such as printing, brewing, smithing, milling, and many others are represented not simply as static displays, but as living, working operations that visitors may in some cases even be invited to participate in. It is located near the Hagen community of Eilpe. The Historisches Centrum Hagen includes the city museum and Werdringen castle. In the Bl\u00e4tterh\u00f6hle cave in Hagen the oldest fossils of modern people in Westphalia and the Ruhr were found. Some date back to the early Mesolithic, 10,700 years B.C. It seems that the descendants of Mesolithic people in this area maintained a foraging lifestyle for more than 2000 years after the arrival of farming societies.[3]\n some localities of Hagen:\n The following table shows the largest foreign resident groups in the city of Hagen.[4]\n The Autobahnen A1, A45 and A46 touch Hagen.\n Hagen has been an important rail junction for the southeastern Ruhr valley since the first rail line opened in 1848.

Runnels served as the sixth Governor of Texas, for only one term, but notably was the only person to ever defeat Sam Houston in a political contest.\n Runnels was born to Hardin D. and Martha \"Patsy\" Burch (Darden) Runnels on August 30, 1820 in Mississippi.[1]  His father died in 1842 and his mother moved the family to Texas the same year.[2][Note 1]  There Runnels established a cotton plantation in Bowie County along the Red River.[3]\n Elected to represent Bowie county in the Texas House of Representatives in 1847, Runnels remained a member of the state legislature through 1854.[2]  During his final session, he was Speaker of the Texas House.[3]  Runnels was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1855, serving in this capacity during Governor Elisha M. Pease's second term.[1][3]  During his time in the legislature and as Lieutenant Governor he gained a reputation as a loyal member of the Democratic Party and an advocate for states' rights.[1]\n When the Democratic Party held its first convention in Texas in May 1857, Runnels attended as a delegate.[1][2] Sam Houston had upset many voters with his pro-Union position, association with the Know Nothings during 1855, and his vote against the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act.[2]   As a result, party leaders blocked Houston's nomination for governor and Runnels was selected instead.[1]  Houston, sensing he was unlikely to be reappointed to the U.S. Senate, announced he was running for governor as an independent on May 12, 1857.  While states' rights were nominally the primary issue, the resulting campaign quickly became a contest of personalities.[2]  Voter anger over Houston's recent political positions continued until election day and Runnels became the only person to defeat Houston in an election by a vote of 38,552 to 23,628.[1]\n During Runnels' administration, primary concerns were the slavery issue and safety of settlers in the western frontier.[2]  On the slavery issue he signed a bill into law allowing a free Negro to return to slavery by selecting a new master and attempted to force the state legislature to officially support the reestablishment of the African slave trade.[1]  In more general support of southern issues, Runnels repeatedly stated Texas might secede if needed.[1]  On the issue of frontier security, the governor commissioned Colonel John \"Rip\" Ford as senior captain of the Rangers on January 27, 1858.  Ford led the Antelope Hills Expedition into the Comancheria, winning the Battle of Antelope Hills in May. Later in the year, the Rangers fought an inconclusive battle in the Rio Grande Valley against Mexican bandit Juan Cortina.  Despite these efforts, the Rangers failed to secure peace on the frontier.[2]  As a secondary concern, Runnels advocated reductions in the level of support the state provided railroad companies, arguing that the railroads had been slow in fulfilling their contractual obligations.[3]\n The Democratic party renominated Runnels as their nominee for governor during the election of 1859, with Houston again running against him.[1]  Runnels, however, received most of the blame for continuing frontier depredations, while Houston had regained his popularity. As a result, Runnels was defeated by Houston by a vote of 33,375 to 27,500.[4]\n After leaving office, Runnels returned to his home and never again ran for elected office.[4]  He, however, remained active in politics, serving as a member of both the 1861 Secession Convention and the 1866 Constitutional convention.[3]  Runnels died on December 25, 1873, and was buried in a family plot in Bowie County.  His remains were re-interred in a state cemetery in Austin in 1929.[4]\n", " The Johnson County Courthouse in Buffalo, Wyoming was built in 1884.  The Italianate style building adjoins the former Johnson County Library, which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n On April 19, 1881, Wyoming Territorial governor John Wesley Hoyt appointed two Johnson County residents as the first county commissioners of Johnson County.  They organized the first county election on April 27, 1881.  On June 27, 1881, the newly elected commissioners met, and purchased the Lone Star Dance Hall and stables to be used as offices for the county.[2]\n By November 1883, it was apparent that the former dance hall was not a secure place for the county's records, and that the condition of the building was such that repairs would not be practical.  The commissioners felt that Johnson County needed a new facility for its records, courtrooms, and prisoners.  The commissioners requested bids on April 30, 1884, and reviewed the bids on June 8, 1884.  The low bid of $81,650 from Edward and James Curran was accepted, and they were awarded the contract.[2]\n The Johnson County Courthouse is a good example of the Italianate style of architecture.  The stilted arch window openings with pronounced keystones and the consoles on cornices are characteristics of this style.  Bricks for the courthouse were made from clay soil mined from a location just south of the Buffalo City Park.  Kilns at the foot of the Big Horn Mountains provided the lime for the mortar.\n[3]\n The structure has changed little since it was built in 1884, except for the removal of the bell tower.  The courthouse is two stories high, built of red brick, and is situated above street level.  A border of white was painted under the eaves, and an emblem of the rising sun occupies the space high above main doorway facing east.  The door way is recessed.[3]\n In the early days, heat was provided by wood and coal stoves.  A steam heating system was installed, and at that time the bricks of the foundation were cemented over, and a chimney on the north side was removed.  At one time, a hallway led to a door on the south side.  However, a vault was needed for storage so the door was closed off and the vault constructed where the hallway had been.  The courtroom was remodelled after World War II.  More recent remodelling in 1973-1974 included an enclosed counter on the main floor hallway.  The jail has been moved to a separate structure.

Of the rest of the land, 4.4% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (5.9%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).[5]\n The former municipality is located in the Ruis sub-district of the Surselva district.  It is located in the Vorderrhein valley.\n Rueun had a population (as of 2011) of 414.[5]  As of 2008[update], 8.0% of the population was made up of foreign nationals.[6]  Over the last 10 years the population has decreased at a rate of -1.1%.  Most of the population (as of 2000[update]) speaks Romansh (72.0%), with German  being second most common (14.3%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 4.1%).[5]\n As of 2000[update], the gender distribution of the population was 48.9% male and 51.1% female.[7]  The age distribution, as of 2000[update], in Rueun is; 67 children or 14.6% of the population are between 0 and 9 years old and 52 teenagers or 11.3% are between 10 and 19.

He felt limited within the domain of the performing arts, which was not free from censorship, and began writing fiction. Choi Ihn Suk says the following. \u201cAt the time, there was censorship. If you finished writing a script, you had to submit it to the Performing Arts Committee before putting on the show. Then the committee would read the script. They\u2019d cross out certain sections with red lines, demanding an edit, and in the worst case the show couldn\u2019t happen. You could only put up a show once you passed through censorship. Fiction or poetry would get censored afterwards, but performances would get censored beforehand. Due to such conditions of the time, it was difficult to write a script and put up a play. So I began writing fiction.\u201d[1]\n As a writer who began writing fiction to find literary freedom, Choi Ihn Suk is a writer who expands his literary scope by repeated change. Gangcheolmujigae (\uac15\ucca0\ubb34\uc9c0\uac1c Iron Rainbow), a novel published in 2015, is a science fiction story about Korea after 2100. In Gangcheolmujigae (\uac15\ucca0\ubb34\uc9c0\uac1c Iron Rainbow), the value of labor in Korea has fallen, and nuclear waste has been spilled over the Yellow Sea, turning it into a sea of death. Society is controlled by a totalitarian regime, and other than the fact that there has been reunification, it is a place of darkness. Upon such imagination of science fiction, Choi Ihn Suk throw a question of realism regarding reality.[2]\n Choi Ihn Suk was born on September 17, 1953, in Namwon Jeollabukdoas as a second son among 2 sons and 4 daughters. His father was a reporter at a regional newspaper, and was also an editorialist. Later, he spent his life as a student in Jeonju and Seoul. His literary dreams began during his high school years, and argued with his parents on whether he should go into the arts or the sciences. He went to university in 1972.\n As a writer, he wrote plays first. In 1977, he submitted a play to a new writer's contest, and that led to him participating in a \u2018Playwriting Workshop\u2019 taught by Yeo Seok-ki, a professor of English literature at Korea University at the time. He wrote a play \u201cByeokgwa chang\u201d (\ubcbd\uacfc \ucc3d The Wall and the Window) in this workshop, and that play won the Monthly Korean Literature New Writer's Award in 1980, launching his literary career. Afterwards, he put up various plays on the stage, actively pursuing his career as a playwright. With \u201cEotteon saramdo sarajiji anneunda\u201d (\uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub3c4 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4 No One Disappears), he won the Baeksang Arts Awards New Writer's Award in 1983, and the Yeonghui Play Award in 1985. In the same year he won the Korean Literature Prize New Writer's Award with \u201cGeu Chanlanhadeon yeoreumeul wihayeo\u201d (\uadf8 \ucc2c\ub780\ud558\ub358 \uc5ec\ub984\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec For That Shining Summer). In 1988 he won the Grand Bell Award in Dramatization for \u201cChilsu and Mansu\u201d (\uce60\uc218\uc640 \ub9cc\uc218), showing his talent in various areas.\n His start as a fiction writer began in 1986, when his novel Gugyeongkkun (\uad6c\uacbd\uafbc The Onlooker) won the Novelists\u2019 Award. He was writing fiction along with playwrighting, and from time to time he also translated, but he then focused on writing fiction, which became his main profession. Until now he has written many collections and novels. Through these works, he has passed through the 1980s that were fired up with furious resistance against the savage reality, the 1990s, which was a time of the inner minds and desires of individuals, and the 2000s, where new liberalism brought on the far limits of pariah capitalism. Having withstood the harsh times with writing fiction, his literary scope flows with such times, but as much as he has stood by for so long, his views on world and humanity has become deeper, and more original. Particularly, in Nae yeonghonui oomul (\ub0b4 \uc601\ud63c\uc758 \uc6b0\ubb3c The Well of My Soul), the fantasy world that was in the novel was praised by the literary community as searching for a new method of depicting a changed reality, also influence many writers later. With his collection Nae yeonghonui oomul (\ub0b4 \uc601\ud63c\uc758 \uc6b0\ubb3c The Well of My Soul) he won the 3rd Daesan Literary Award in 1995. He won the 8th Park Young-joon Literary Prize in 1997 with his novella Norae-e gwanhayeo (\ub178\ub798\uc5d0 \uad00\ud558\uc5ec About Singing), and he won the 8th Hahn Moo-Sook Literary Prize in 2003 with his collection Gureongideului jib (\uad6c\ub801\uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc9d1 The House of Serpents).[3]\n Literary critic Hwang Jong-yeon has pointed to the characters that Choi Ihn Suk has carefully reproduced through his fiction, and state that they \u201care a type of people who promoted political radicalism\u201d, and that they \u201cpossess social identity that coincides with those who are considered as people that had predominated literature in the 70s and the 80s\u201d.[4] Hwang Jong-yeon has further said the following on the characters and the places that are featured in Choi Ihn Suk's fiction. \u201cThe people Choi Ihn Suk depicts in his fiction are those that have broke off or have been cast out from the established order. They are those for whom it is impossible to lead a life like a normal person, such as a criminal serving a sentence in a prison, a laborer working on construction sites, and the poor in a red-light district that have become morally corrupted. Moreover, his fiction often limits itself to a certain place, where the surrounding characters can fully use their advantages. Isolated places like prisons, detention camps, brothels, construction sites, orphanages, the military, and remote villages form quite dramatic environments where common sense and ideas on life are overlooked, and certain terrible truths regarding humanity are revealed.\u201d[5] However, the fiction that Choi Ihn Suk is writing has a big difference from the popular realism of the 1980s. Choi Ihn Suk's characters are not noble people placed within a myth of identity that realists had explained as those that lead historical progress. Rather, they are living within extreme situations with pitiful conditions. They are beasts, similar to the \u2018wolves\u2019 that Hobbes had pointed out. Choi Ihn Suk's story of human beasts unfolding within an extreme environment is a constant focus on the reality of our times.\n", " Pe\u00f1as de San Pedro is a municipality in Albacete, Castile-La Mancha, Spain.\n Pe\u00f1as de San Pedro is 66.41 sq miles (172\u00a0km\u00b2) located south of CM-313 and west of CM-3203.

Beginning in January 1833 at the age of twenty, she attended Prudence Crandall's Canterbury Female Boarding School in Canterbury, Connecticut, considered to be the first integrated schoolhouse in the United States.[1][2][3]\n Fayerweather was born Sarah Ann Major Harris on April 16, 1812, in Norwich, Connecticut. The daughter of William Monteflora Harris and Sally Prentice Harris, both of whom were free farmers, Fayerweather was of African and French West Indian descent and the second eldest of twelve children.[4] She was raised in the Orthodox Congregational Church of Canterbury.[5]\n In September 1832, Fayerweather requested admission to the Canterbury Female Boarding School. In a letter to William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper The Liberator, Crandall recalls Fayerweather's visit: \"A colored girl of respectability \u2013 a professor of religion \u2013 and daughter of honorable parents, called on me sometime during the month of September last, and said in a very earnest manner, 'Miss Crandall, I want to get a little more learning, enough if possible to teach colored children, and if you will admit me into your school I shall forever be under the greatest obligation to you. If you think it will be the means of injuring you, I will not insist on the favor.'\"[6] After brief deliberation, Crandall admitted her to the school and refused to expel her when the parents of most of the other attendees withdrew their daughters.[7]\n Faced with severe opposition from the Canterbury community, Crandall closed the existing school \u2013 only to reopen in 1833 in order to teach a group of solely African-American students. Fayerweather continued to attend the school in the face of harassment and ostracization until Crandall, afraid for her pupils' safety after a mob converged on the school in September 1834, closed the school permanently.[8]\n Fayerweather married George Fayerweather, Jr., a mixed-race blacksmith ten years her senior, on November 28, 1833.[9] The couple moved to New London, Connecticut in 1841 before moving to Kingston, Rhode Island, in 1855 to raise their eight children.[10] Both Fayerweather and her husband supported abolitionism and racial equality; Fayerweather joined the Kingston Anti-Slavery Society, attended antislavery meetings held by the American Anti-Slavery Society in various cities across the North, maintained a correspondence with her former teacher Prudence Crandall and former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and subscribed to The Liberator until Garrison ceased printing it in 1865.[11][12] She also maintained an active church life, joining the Sunday school class at Kingston's Congregational church.[13]\n Surviving her husband by nine years, Fayerweather died on November 16, 1878, from a swelling of the neck. She was buried in the Old Fernwood Cemetery in Kingston, Rhode Island.[14]\n In 1970 Fayerweather Hall, a dormitory on the campus of University of Rhode Island, was named for Sarah Harris Fayerweather.[15][16] The Fayerweather Craft Guild, located in Kingston at the site of the Fayerweather family's former home and blacksmith shop, was also named in her honor.[17]\n", " The Waldpolenz Solar Park is a 52-megawatt (MW) photovoltaic power station built by German developer and operator Juwi at a former military air base near Leipzig, Eastern Germany. When completed by the end of 2008, it was the world's largest thin-film solar park using CdTe-modules.[1]\n Initially, the solar power plant's nameplate capacity was 40 MW, consisting of 500,000 state-of-the-art solar panels provided by U.S. manufacturer First Solar, and generated 40,000\u00a0MWh of electricity per year.[2] The solar park was then extended with another 153,650 panels, also provided by First Solar, to a final capacity of 52\u00a0MWP in 2011[3]\n The installation is located in the Muldentalkreis district in the state of Saxony in eastern Germany, built on half of the location's 220 hectares (543.6 acres)[4]  in the townships of Brandis and Bennewitz.[5] The investment costs for the Waldpolenz solar park have amounted to some 130 million euro.[2]\n \n", " The Kokish River is a river on Northern Vancouver Island, flowing north into Beaver Cove.[1]  The community of Beaver Cove is near the river's mouth, as was the former logging camp of Englewood.

The team, founded by former F1 driver Aguri Suzuki, was based in Tokyo, Japan but operated from the former Arrows factory at the Leafield Technical Centre, Oxfordshire. The cars were referred to as Super Aguri Hondas, with the team functioning to some degree as an unofficial Honda 'B'-team. In Japan, public pressure persuaded Honda to help its former driver Takuma Sato to continue to compete in Formula One. This was influential in the creation of Super Aguri's F1 project and the engine supply from Super Aguri's parent company Honda. After participating in the championship for 2 years and 4 months, the team withdrew from F1 after 4 races in the 2008 season due to financial difficulties. Throughout the team's time in the sport, it scored 4 points. All of these were scored by Sato during the 2007 season.\n Talks to start the team began in February 2005, but it was not until September that plans started to take shape.[1] The team registered its intention to enter the Formula One World Championship to the FIA, Formula One's governing body, on 1 November (ahead of the governing body's 15 November deadline). However, the FIA's official press release of the entry list for 2006 confirmed that it had not approved Super Aguri's entry: this was reported to be due to the team's failure to produce the required $48 million entry bond on time.[2][3] The team re-applied for entry in 2006, and continued to prepare cars for the upcoming season.[4]\nHaving missed the initial registration, the team needed to convince the existing ten teams to unanimously agree to its entry. It appeared that the Midland team was blocking on the grounds of potentially reduced TV revenue, but it was eventually granted the necessary unanimous agreement and the team's entry was confirmed by the FIA on 26 January 2006.[5]\n In 2006, the cars were powered by Honda engines (RA806E 2.4 V8), and used Bridgestone tyres. The chassis, SA05, was based on the 2002 Arrows A23, bought from ex-Minardi principal Paul Stoddart who purchased them when the Arrows team went into receivership. The team had announced plans to produce a new in-house chassis later on in the 2006 season, possibly for the European races, but this never came into fruition. Instead, the team updated their older chassis to become the SA06 \u2013 a change which was visible from the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, onwards.[6]\n Takuma Sato and Yuji Ide were the initial race drivers for the team in the 2006 season, with Franck Montagny as the third driver. On 4 May, after four races, the team announced that Montagny would be replacing Ide as race driver in the European Grand Prix and subsequent races, after Ide's Super Licence was revoked after a clash with Christijan Albers.\n The team made it onto the grid for the start of the season. In its debut race at Bahrain, Sato successfully completed the Grand Prix while Ide retired on lap 35 with a mechanical failure and after nearly running over his pit crew. Suzuki deemed this race to be a good test for the team as the car had only done a maximum of 10 laps during pre-season testing. The team's second race (in Malaysia) was little better, with again only Sato finishing the race.\n Super Aguri's third race, the Australian Grand Prix, saw significant improvement. Ide said \"This is the first time that both Taku and I have finished a race, so I am happy about that.\"[7]\n For the European Grand Prix, Ide and Montagny swapped roles within the team, at the request of the FIA, who felt Ide needed more experience outside of the Grand Prix. This was mostly due to a collision between him and Midland driver Christijan Albers at the San Marino Grand Prix.\n As of 10 May 2006 the FIA Permit Office revoked Ide's Super Licence, thus preventing his return to an F1 seat until at least the 2007 season. Montagny raced until and including the French Grand Prix, and on 8 June 2006 Sakon Yamamoto became Super Aguri's third driver. Montagny and Yamamoto swapped roles for the German Grand Prix, with Yamamoto taking over Super Aguri's second car.\n When the updated car (the SA06) was first raced in the German Grand Prix, it managed to impress, with decent qualifying positions (managing to outperform the Midland F1 Team), although failing to finish the race.\n The team's improving form culminated with an impressive tenth place at the Brazilian Grand Prix from Sato, whilst Yamamoto set the seventh-fastest fastest lap, less than a second behind most of the points-finishers.[8]\n Reports suggesting that the team would be using the works Honda chassis of 2006 came under intense resistance by rival teams Williams and Spyker, who contested that the practice was against Formula One regulations.[9] The teams cited the fact that the Concorde Agreement mandated a car may not use any parts designed or constructed by another manufacturer of Formula One cars. Super Aguri (as well as Scuderia Toro Rosso and Red Bull) seemed to be in violation about this. The FIA however did not have the authority to act on the Concorde Agreement without the matter already being resolved in court. However, Super Aguri (as well as the Red Bull teams) stated that they were in compliance with the sport's regulations, though the matter was still of great contention.[10]\n Super Aguri announced on 15 November 2006 that Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson (previously Honda third and test driver) would be driving for the team in 2007.[11] Super Aguri also confirmed, on 15 December, that Giedo van der Garde would be their third driver in the 2007 season.  However, the Dutchman left for Spyker F1 before the season began.[12] Sakon Yamamoto, who was a second driver in late 2006, went back to being a test driver in 2007.\n The team suffered a major setback when their car for 2007 failed the FIA crash test, with the rear of the car being destroyed more than is allowed. On 2 March, Super Aguri pushed back the launch of its new car by two days, with the SA07 unveiled less than 48 hours before the first practice session for the Australian Grand Prix. Team's drivers Davidson and Sato shocked many people with getting 10th and 11th place in qualifying for Australian GP. Until this, the best result in qualification set by this team was 17th place (by Takuma Sato). Sato dropped to 12th by the race's end, while Anthony Davidson's race was ruined on the very first lap when Spyker's Adrian Sutil collided with him after a failed passing move. Davidson's car was thrown into the air, severely jarring his back upon landing.  He drove through the pain to finish 16th and was taken to hospital following the race.[13]\n Shortly before the 2007 Australian Grand Prix, the team announced SS United Group Oil & Gas Company as its title sponsor.  Also in 2007 Super Aguri signed an official supplier agreement with Speakerbus to supply race intercom.  However, SS United Group defaulted on sponsorship payments, forcing the team to cut as many as 30 staff.[14][15]\n At the Spanish Grand Prix the team scored its first point ever, when Takuma Sato finished in 8th place. The Japanese driver benefited from the high attrition rate which saw cars usually in the points from Ferrari, BMW Sauber, Toyota and Williams drop out.\n At the Canadian Grand Prix the team scored its highest finish to that date, with Takuma Sato finishing 6th and garnering 3 points, passing defending world champion Fernando Alonso on track en route. ITV commentators mention that had it not been for a botched pit stop, Sato may have finished as high as fourth. Teammate Davidson also looked set to finish in the points until he hit a gopher which ran across the track, forcing him to pit and leaving him out of the points. \n After the European Grand Prix, Sakon Yamamoto was signed up by the Spyker F1 team for the remainder of the season, filling in the seat left vacant by Christijan Albers.\n Super Aguri kept their 2007 drivers Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson, following the acquisition of an unspecified portion of the team by the Magma Group.[16] Luca Filippi was once linked to a drive in 2008.[17] However, he then signed to the GP2 team ART Grand Prix partnering Romain Grosjean. On 8 January 2008 the team announced that the SA08 would be launched in Barcelona, Spain.[18] On 12 February Super Aguri postponed the SA08 launch and did not announce for how long due to their uncertainty of the future of the team.[19] The team then said that although it had cancelled its attendance at the final pre-season tests because some parts had not arrived, it expected to compete at the first race of the 2008 season in Australia. However, Magma pulled out of their proposed takeover, leaving Super Aguri's future in doubt again.\n The Super Aguri F1 Team travelled to Barcelona and competed in the 2008 Spanish Grand Prix, allegedly aided by financial support from F1 supremo, Bernie Ecclestone. On arrival at the Istanbul Park for the 2008 Turkish Grand Prix, Super Aguri's trucks and motorhomes were denied entry to the circuit, because Honda Racing CEO Nick Fry reportedly told the race organizers that Super Aguri would not be taking part.[20] On 6 May 2008, team founder and principal Aguri Suzuki announced that they were to withdraw from the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship with immediate effect due to financial problems,[21] citing the breach of contract by the promised partner SS United Group Oil & Gas Company resulting in the loss of financial backing as putting the team into financial difficulties.[22]\nIt was confirmed on 7 May that Super Aguri had gone into administration, after a team of corporate recovery partners was appointed to seek a buyer for the operation.[23]\n In spite of the fact that it is mentioned the Magma Group pulled out, it was down to Nick Fry not accepting the 3-year debt payment plan Magma Group proposed. Fry wanted the whole payment at once or he would not allow the team to compete.\n The team's assets were bought by German businessman Franz Hilmer (Formtech GmbH), who applied unsuccessfully to enter the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship using the Brabham name. The intellectual property of the team is still owned by Formtech Composites, which is situated at the factory in Leafield, United Kingdom.\n (key) (results in bold indicate pole position)\n", " The Blue Bonnet is a 1919 American silent drama film directed by Louis Chaudet and starring Billie Rhodes, Ben F.

Northwestern has eight men's and eleven women's NCAA Division I sports teams. The mascot is Willie the Wildcat. The athletic director is former Northern Illinois University Athletic Director Jim Phillips, who took office in April 2008.\n Northwestern is a charter member of the Big Ten Conference. Ever since the University of Chicago dropped out in 1946, Northwestern has been the only private institution in the conference. At only 8,200 undergraduates, it is by far the smallest. The second-smallest school, Iowa, is almost three times as large as Northwestern, at 21,000 undergraduates.\n Currently, Northwestern fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men's and 11 women's) in addition to numerous club sports.[2] Current successful athletic programs include football, men's soccer, wrestling, men's swimming, men's golf, women's tennis, softball, fencing and women's lacrosse. The women's lacrosse team is the six-time NCAA national champion, and went undefeated in 2005.[3][4] The 1930\u201331 Wildcats were retroactively named national champions by both the Helms Athletic Foundation (in 1942) and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[5][6]\n The Northwestern Athletics' mascot is Willie the Wildcat. However, the team's first mascot was not Willie, but a live, caged bear cub from the Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw. In fall 1923, Furpaw was driven to the playing field to greet the fans before each game. After a losing season, the team decided that Furpaw was the harbinger of bad luck and banished him from campus. Willie made his debut ten years later in 1933 as a logo, but did not actually come to life until 1947, when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed up as him during the Homecoming parade. The Northwestern University Marching Band (NUMB) performs at all home football and lead cheers in the student section and the alma mater at the end of the game.\n In 1998, two former Northwestern basketball players were charged and convicted for sports bribery as a result of being paid to shave points in games against three other Big Ten schools during the 1995 season.[7][8][9] The football team became embroiled in a different betting scandal later that year when federal prosecutors indicted four former players for perjury related to betting on their own games.[10] In August 2001, Rashidi Wheeler, a senior safety, collapsed and died during practice from an asthma attack.[11][12] An autopsy revealed that he had ephedrine, a stimulant banned by the NCAA, in his system which prompted Northwestern to investigate the prevalence of stimulants and other banned substances across all of its athletic programs.[13][14] In 2006, the Northwestern women's soccer team was suspended and coach Jenny Haigh resigned following the release of images of alleged hazing.[15][16]\n Northwestern's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats. Before 1924, they were known as \"The Purple\" and unofficially as \"The Fighting Methodists.\" The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago, \"Football players had not come down from Evanston; wildcats would be a name better suited to Coach Glenn Thistletwaite's boys.\" The team was also referred to in the article as \"a Purple wall of wildcats.\"[17] The name was so popular that university board members made \"Wildcats\" the official nickname just months later. In 1972, the student body voted to change the official nickname from \"Wildcats\" to \"Purple Haze\" but the new name never stuck.[18]\n During football games, students jingle their car keys before every kickoff and punt. When Northwestern is on defense, students extend their arms, make a claw with their hands, and growl.  The \"official\" cheer at Northwestern sporting events is the chant \"Go U! NU!\" \n Northwestern Wildside is the official student section of Northwestern athletics. They are led in their gameday cheers by the Wildside leaders and Northwestern University cheerleaders, who perform on the sidelines during all home games and accompany the football team to all away games. The NUMB performs on the field and in the stands at all home games and follows the football team to one Big Ten away game per season.\n For many years, students would throw marshmallows at the kick-off of football games. Northwestern archivist Patrick Quinn says that students were likely \"trying to get them into the tubas, and then started throwing them at each other\", leading to the tradition of throwing marshmallows at the field. While Gary Barnett was football coach, he banned marshmallows because they supposedly detracted from the serious level of football that he wanted for the school.\n Northwestern's fight song is \"Go U Northwestern\" A secondary fight song is \"Rise Northwestern (Push on Song)\", the final 4-measure tag (ending with a shouted \"Go, 'Cats!\") of which is often played after first downs.\n The Northwestern University football team has evidence of organization in 1876. Northwestern achieved an all-time high rank of No. 1 during the 1936 and 1962 seasons, which has thus far not been duplicated. The football team plays at Ryan Field (formerly known as Dyche Stadium). The football team has a history of mediocrity: Its all-time record is 468\u2013614\u201344 (.435) and until July 2012, the program held the official record for Division I-A losses.[19][20] Other dubious distinctions include being on the losing end of the greatest comeback in Division I-A history[21] and holding the record for the longest losing streak in Division I-A \u2013 34 consecutive games between 1979 and 1982.[22][23]\n Until 2013, the Wildcats had been to nine bowl games since 1995 \u2013 1996 Rose Bowl, 1997 Citrus Bowl, 2000 Alamo Bowl, 2003 Motor City Bowl, 2005 Sun Bowl, 2008 Alamo Bowl, the 2010 Outback Bowl, the 2011 TicketCity Bowl and 2011 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas\u2014but had not won a postseason contest since the 1949 Rose Bowl until the 2013 Gator Bowl.[24]\n Following the sudden death of football coach Randy Walker in 2006,[25] 31-year-old and former All-American Northwestern linebacker Pat Fitzgerald assumed the position becoming the youngest Division I FBS coach at the time.[26][27]\n The men's basketball team did not earn a bid to the NCAA tournament until 2017.  Its last conference championship came in 1933, when it tied with Ohio State. The 1931 team was retro-picked as national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and, later, by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[5] The Wildcats have played in the National Invitation Tournament seven times, most recently in 2012. The team plays its home games in Welsh-Ryan Arena, where it is cheered on by the Wildside student section. The head coach is former Duke Associate Head Coach Chris Collins; he succeeds Bill Carmody. Under Carmody, a former head coach at Princeton, the team ran the Princeton offense.  \n Northwestern was the only school from a Power Five conference, and one of the few long-standing members of Division I, to have never played in the NCAA Tournament. In 2017, the painful wait for the NCAA championship finally ended, when the Wildcats earned a tournament berth. They won their first found matchup against Vanderbilt University, but lost to number one seed Gonzaga in the second round.[28]\n The women's team has made appearances in the NCAA Tournament in 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1997, and 2015.\n Northwestern has won the national championship in women's lacrosse five straight times, from 2005 to 2009, and then again in 2011 and 2012, giving them 7 championships in 8 years. In 2007, the team joined Maryland as the only other school to three-peat. The run started in 2005, when the team enjoyed a perfect season and defeated many long-established east-coast schools after only five years as a varsity sport to capture the school's first national championship since 1941. In doing so, it became the westernmost institution to ever win the title. Soon after, the team made national news when members appeared in a White House photo with President Bush wearing thong sandals, or flip-flops, dubbed as the \"White House flip-flop flap.\"[29] The 2009 season also was an undefeated run. In their five championship seasons, the Wildcats have a 106\u20133 record.[30]\n In 2006 and 2007, Kristen Kjellman received the Tewaaraton Trophy, which honors the best collegiate lacrosse player in the country. She was the first player from a non-East coast school to win the distinction, and the first player to be a two-time winner.[31] Midfielder Hannah Nielsen received the award in 2008 and 2009, the second player to be a two-time winner.[32][33] Northwestern's Shannon Smith won the award in 2011.[34]\n The Northwestern University Wildcats men's wrestling team competes in the NCAA Division I and belong to the Big Ten Conference. Tournaments and home matches are hosted in the Welsh-Ryan Arena. The wrestling facilities are named in honor of Ken Kraft, for his 48 years of involvement with the Northwestern wrestling program. Kraft was a four-year member of the Wildcat wrestling squad and NU's head coach for 22 years. In 2004, Kraft retired after spending 51 years at NU as an athlete, coach and administrator.[35] Drew Pariano is the current head coach for the Wildcats succeeding his college coach, Tim Cysewski, in 2010. Pariano has coached 11 NCAA All-Americans while at Northwestern and 3 NCAA Champions: Dustin Fox at Heavyweight in 2008, Jake Herbert at 184 lbs. in 2007 & 2009 and Jason Tsirtsis at 149 lbs. in 2014. Jake Herbert was also a three-time Big Ten Conference champion, and four-time NCAA All-American. He went 149\u20134 while at Northwestern University and won both the 2009 Dan Hodge Trophy, awarded to the best college wrestler in the nation, and the 2009 Big Ten Athlete of the Year award.[36]\n The men's golf team has won eight Big Ten Conference championships: 1925, 1937, 1939, 1948, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006. They have twice placed second in the NCAA Championships: 1939, 1945.\n Luke Donald won the NCAA Individual Championship in 1999. He was Big Ten Conference Player of the year in 1999, and David Merkow was named the same in 2006.[37] Donald was ranked number 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking for 56 weeks in 2011 and 2012.  The four best career stroke averages in school history are held by Luke Donald, Tom Johnson, Jess Daley, and David Lipsky.[38]\n In 1946 and 1957, Phyllis Otto and Mariam Bailey, respectively, won the women's individual intercollegiate golf championship (an event conducted by the Division of Girls' and Women's Sports (DGWS) \u2014 which later evolved into the current NCAA women's golf championship).\n The Northwestern Wildcats men's and women's soccer teams both use the 20,000-capacity Toyota Park for their home games for the 2015 season due to construction of the Lanny and Sharon Martin Stadium on the Lakeside Complex.   The field is a part of a $250 million athletics upgrade on the lakefront.\n The Wildcats program began in 1976 and has amassed 5 Big Ten championships, 10 NCAA Tournament appearances, and 5 appearances in the Women's college World series- including 2007 and their national runner-up performance 2006.\n In the NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships held from 1924 through 1936, no team points were officially awarded.[39] Northwestern won four unofficial national team championships during these years, which were proclaimed in the newspapers of the time, second only to Michigan's seven.[40]\n Matt Grevers, a Northwestern alum, won two gold medals (100-meter backstroke, 400-meter medley relay) and a silver medal (400-meter freestyle relay) at the 2012 London Olympic Games.\n Seymour Greenberg, later ranked US No. 5 in singles in 1943 and 1944, was captain of the Northwestern University tennis team and became the school's first Big Ten Conference singles champion when he won the title in 1940.  He repeated in 1941 and won the Big Ten doubles championships in 1940 (with Jerry Clifford), 1941 (with Gene Richards), and 1942 (also with Richards).  Greenberg's three doubles titles still rank first all-time in Big Ten history.  He led the Northwestern Wildcats to the Big Ten team championships in 1940 and 1942.[46]\n Grant Golden, later a top-10 world player, played collegiate tennis from 1948 to 1951 at Northwestern University, where he was Big Ten Conference singles and doubles champion in 1950, and named an All American.[47]  He earned his doubles title with Bill Landin.\n In Women's Tennis, Audra Cohen attended Northwestern in the Fall of 2004, and won her first 23 singles matches.[48]  She then won the ITA National Singles Title and the ITA Midwest Championships.[48]\n Their chief Big Ten rival is the Illinois Fighting Illini.  In football, the teams annually compete for the Land of Lincoln Trophy. This trophy replaced the Sweet Sioux Tomahawk Trophy in 2009 after the use of the Tomahawk was acknowledged as offensive to the culture of Native Americans.\n Northwestern fans have also cultivated strong rivalries with many Big Ten Conference foes, including Iowa and, particularly, Wisconsin. The rivalry with Wisconsin, the Big Ten conference school geographically closest to the Evanston campus, has grown stronger in recent years, though there is currently no official trophy for the football game.\n Although the schools rarely play each other, there has been discussion of starting a rivalry game with Northern Illinois University to help boost attendance and interest during the non-conference schedule.\n The 2005\u20132006 academic year was one of the best athletic seasons in Northwestern University's history. The football team capped a 7\u20135 season and third-place finish in the Big Ten with a bid to the Sun Bowl. Following the women's lacrosse team's second National Championship, the Women's doubles tennis team of Christelle Grier and Alexis Prousis won the National Championship as well. In addition, Men's tennis player Peter Rispoli captured the Flight B Singles Championship. The Women's Softball team made an incredible run to the finals of the Women's College World Series, finishing in second place.\n In May 2006 the website BadJocks.com republished photos a reader had found on Webshots of the women's soccer team hazing its freshmen. The whole team was suspended for a time as a result and in the wake of the incident Head Coach Jenny Haigh resigned. Since, Athletic Director Mark Murphy named Stephanie Erickson, the school's all-time leader in goals and points, as Haigh's replacement.\n Northwestern University has won 8 NCAA national championships:[49]\n See also: \n National team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA (4 are unofficial NCAA championships):\n See also: \n", " Ghetto Blaster is a computer game that was released for the Commodore 64 in 1985.  It was developed by two former employees of the software house Taskset.[3]\n The goal is to find and collect ten cassette tapes of dance music, get people to dance to them by blasting them with notes from your ghetto blaster, then delivering them to your record company, Interdisc.[4] These ten music tracks were played by the game throughout. A maze of streets, alleyways and cul-de-sacs are laid out, populated by bizarre characters, some helpful and some deadly.\n The street names are named after famous songs (\"Blackberry Way\", \"Desolation Row\", etc.) - a map was provided in the cassette inlay[4] - and some of the characters reference others (one to avoid is the Psycho Killer, while the Jumpin' Jack Flash It's A Gas Gas Gas takes you to a tape's location).\n Zzap! 64 gave the game a fairly positive review.  They were impressed by the music and found the gameplay instantly appealing, but somewhat repetitive. which diminished lasting interest.[4]\n", " Hit Records was a record company based in Nashville, Tennessee, which specialized in sound-alike cover versions of hit records.\n Founded in 1962 by Bill Beasley, Hit Records were sold in dime stores for 39\u00a2 (US), less than half the price of the hit recordings they were covering.[1] Located in Nashville, the home base for the country music recording business in the United States, the company had a pool of talented singers and musicians to record the cover songs.  Some of these performers would later become successful on their own such as Sandy Posey,[1] Ray Stevens, Bobby Russell and Sam Moore of Sam & Dave.[2]\n The company folded in 1969 due to competition from record companies such as K-Tel which issued various artists compilation albums featuring the actual hit recordings licensed from the various record companies.[3][4]  Many Hit Records are very collectable and some of the performers on these recordings have developed their own fan base.\n", " Five naval vessels have served in the Royal French Navy (French: Marine Royale Fran\u00e7aise), the French Navy of the Republic (French: Marine de la R\u00e9publique), the French Imperial Navy   (French: Marine Imp\u00e9riale Fran\u00e7aise) and French Navy (French: Marine nationale fran\u00e7aise) have been named Indomptable:\n The destroyer L'Indomptable, launched in 1934, was the first to carry the insignia of the French Foreign Legion.

After marrying Richard Jordan, an American soldier stationed in Germany, Jordan came to the United States. There, she gave birth to three children, and later divorced and married Robert Irwin.[4] Jordan spent much of her early career studying obstetrical anthropology and cross-cultural birth practices, and has been praised by anthropologist Rayna Rapp for her authoritative knowledge of childbirth. Rapp stated: \"Jordan uses her exquisite sense of description to birth a theoretical framework.\" [5] Jordan's theoretical concept of authoritative knowledge has been employed by countless scholars to account for the subsuming of some ways of knowing by others and also to show how knowledge can be laterally distributed. [6]\n Jordan contributed to the field of anthropology by opening her own consulting practice where she held appointments as the Principal Scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and as Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Research on Learning. This led to her receiving the Excellence in Science and Technology Award from the Xerox Corporation for innovative work.[7]\n Jordan's research on the relationship between humans and technology has influenced organizations outside of the field of anthropology, such as the Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI).[8] She is also credited with the development of corporate anthropology.[4]\n Jordan died of pancreatic cancer in her home on May 24, 2016. She lived to be 78, leaving behind her husband, three children, six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.[9][2][10][3] Although Jordan had pancreatic cancer, she made it known to others that she did not want to be treated as incapable because of her condition. She refused medication and remained mentally and intellectually active until the end of her life.[10] She continued to live life in a normalized manner, and helped form her obituary.[7]\n Jordan received the Margaret Mead Award in 1980 for her 1978 book Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States.[11] Her work is credited with inspiring a range of responses within the field of reproductive anthropology that integrated her approaches to her examinations of the social, cultural and biological implications of birth around the world.[12] She is known for showing how knowledge can be \"laterally distributed,\" shared by all, and understood by all.[3]\n In 2015, Jordan was inducted into the American Anthropological Association's (AAA) Distinguished Member program which honors members who have loyally supported the Association for 50 years or more.[13]\n", " Talitha Kumi Evangelical Lutheran School (Arabic: \u0637\u0627\u0644\u064a\u062b\u0627 \u0642\u0648\u0645\u064a\u200e), also known as Evgl.

In 1858 there were 32 students, including Jews, Arabs, and Armenians. The school received the name \"Talitha Kumi\" in 1868, when it received a new building and had 89 students. The seminary and deaconess schools opened in 1905. World War I caused a temporary closure; there were 140 students and eleven deconess teachers in 1914, right as the closure occurred. Up until 1918 the British authorities held the women in Egypt. The school's area became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine. The school reopened in 1926, one year after the British authorities gave the school back to the original owners.[8]\n In 1949, operations in Jerusalem ended;[6] this was because the original location was on the Israeli side the border after the Israeli Declaration of Independence. The post-Israel Talitha Kumi originally operated in Jordanian-controlled territory.[9] The school opened in its current location in Beit Jala in 1961.[6] At the time Beit Jala was a part of Jordan.[1] Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War. Beit Jala went to Palestinian control after 1993.\n The elementary school program uses the Palestinian curriculum.[10] In Kindergarten students begin learning English.

The student body is 50% female and 50% male. About 90% of the students live in the West Bank and the remaining 10% live in East Jerusalem and other Palestinian enclaves. As of 2015 the percentage of Muslim students is increasing because many Christians are leaving Palestine and due to other demographic changes.[11] The school had 865 students, 59% Christian and 41% Muslim, during the 2011-2012 school year: the gender balance was 52% girls and 48% boys.[6]\n As of circa 2009 many students were impeded from getting to school due to difficulty in going to and from their home villages. The school previously admitted students from the Gaza Strip, but the school no longer admitted them once Israel instituted closure policies in the mid-1990s that prevented students temporarily in Gaza from returning to school and vice versa.[12]\n As of 2015 Palestinians make up almost every member of the teaching staff.[11]\n The school is located on a 10-hectare (25-acre) property.[13] There is a boarding facility for female students.

The government Cabinet meeting in March 2000 approved the formation of a new 'Department of Special Affairs' (Jabatan Hal Ehwal Khas, abbreviated JHEK) to be upgraded from CHEK.[3] In 2004, its acronym JHEK was changed to JASA. It was formed initially aimed to explain the government initiatives and programmes before it was slowly deviated and turned into political propaganda machinery for BN especially those of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) to attack the opposition.[4]\n The JASA's controversial functions were questioned and alleged as inefficient governmrnt agency despite having 1046 staffs and huge expenditure of RM74 millions.[5]  Its Director General, Puad Zarkashi (2015-2018) was paid RM 20592.00 for monthly salary, much more than the minister salary of RM 14907.20 monthly.[2]\n After the 2018 general election that saw the downfall of BN government, on 23 May 2018 new Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad of the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition federal government announced that the JASA was among few government agencies and departments that to be abolished.[2][6] Dr Mahathir said JASA was dissolved because it was riddled with too many political elements.[7] JASA was completely dissolved on 15 October 2018 with its 300 civil servants absorbed into other departments and ministries, while its mostly political contract staff cut.[8]\n \n", " Mietesheim is a commune in the Bas-Rhin department in Grand Est in north-eastern France.\n", " \n Trans World Airlines Flight 800 (TWA 800) was a Boeing 747-100 that exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, at about 8:31\u00a0p.m. EDT, 12 minutes after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport on a scheduled international passenger flight to Rome, with a stopover in Paris.[1]:1 All 230 people on board died in the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.\nAccident investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) traveled to the scene, arriving the following morning[1]:313 amid speculation that a terrorist attack was the cause of the crash.[2][3][4] Consequently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and New York Police Department (FBI-NYPD) Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) initiated a parallel criminal investigation.[5] Sixteen months later, the JTTF announced that no evidence had been found of a criminal act and closed its active investigation.[6]\n The four-year NTSB investigation concluded with the approval of the Aircraft Accident Report on August 23, 2000, ending the most extensive, complex, and costly air disaster investigation in U.S. history to that time.[7][8] The report's conclusion was that the probable cause of the accident was explosion of flammable fuel vapors in the center fuel tank. Although it could not be determined with certainty, the likely ignition source was a short circuit.[1]:xvi Problems with the aircraft's wiring were found, including evidence of arcing in the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) wiring that enters the tank. The FQIS on Flight 800 is known to have been malfunctioning; the captain remarked on what he called \"crazy\" readings from the system approximately two minutes and thirty seconds before the aircraft exploded. As a result of the investigation, new requirements were developed for aircraft to prevent future fuel tank explosions.[9]\n The accident airplane, registration N93119, (Boeing 747-131) was manufactured by Boeing in July 1971; it had been ordered by Eastern Air Lines, but after Eastern canceled its 747 orders, the plane was purchased new by TWA. The aircraft had completed 16,869 flights with 93,303 hours of operation.[1]:6 On the day of the accident, the airplane departed from Ellinikon International Airport in Athens, Greece as TWA Flight 881 and arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) about 4:38pm. The aircraft was refueled, and there was a crew change; the new flight crew consisted of 58-year-old Captain Ralph G. Kevorkian, 57-year-old Captain/Check Airman Steven E. Snyder, and 63-year-old Flight Engineer/Check Airman Richard G. Campbell (all of whom were highly experienced veterans flying with TWA), as well as 25-year-old flight engineer trainee Oliver Krick, who was starting the sixth leg of his initial operating experience training.[1]:4\u20135[10][11][note 1]\n The ground-maintenance crew locked out the thrust reverser for engine #3 (treated as a minimum equipment list item) because of technical problems with the thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced.[12] During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was believed to have been triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.[1]:31\n TWA 800 was scheduled to depart JFK for Paris around 7:00\u00a0p.m., but the flight was delayed until 8:02\u00a0p.m. by a disabled piece of ground equipment and a passenger/baggage mismatch.[1]:1 After the owner of the baggage in question was confirmed to be on board, the flight crew prepared for departure and the aircraft pushed back from Gate 27 at the TWA Flight Center. Taxi and takeoff proceeded uneventfully.\n  TWA 800 then received a series of heading changes and generally increasing altitude assignments as it climbed to its intended cruising altitude.[1]:2 Weather in the area was light winds with scattered clouds,[1]:256 and there were dusk lighting conditions.[1]:4 The last radio transmission from the airplane occurred at 8:30\u00a0p.m. when the flight crew received and then acknowledged instructions from Boston Center to climb to 15,000 feet (4,600\u00a0m).[13]:4 The last recorded radar transponder return from the airplane was recorded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar site at Trevose, Pennsylvania at 8:31:12\u00a0p.m.[1]:3\n Thirty-eight seconds later, the captain of an Eastwind Airlines Boeing 737 reported to Boston ARTCC that he \"just saw an explosion out here\", adding, \"we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here\u00a0... about 16,000 feet (4,900\u00a0m) or something like that, it just went down into the water.\" Subsequently, many air traffic control facilities in the New York/Long Island area received reports of an explosion from other pilots operating in the area. Many witnesses in the vicinity of the crash stated that they saw or heard explosions, accompanied by a large fireball or fireballs over the ocean, and observed debris, some of which was burning while falling into the water.[1]:3\n Various civilian, military, and police vessels reached the crash site and searched for survivors within minutes of the initial water impact, but found none,[1]:86 making TWA 800 the second-deadliest aircraft accident in United States history at that time.[14]\n There were 230 people on board TWA 800 including 18 crew and 20 off-duty employees,[15] most of whom were crew meant to cover the Paris-Rome leg of the flight.\n The 18 crew members and 152 passengers were Americans; the remaining passengers were of various other nationalities.\n Notable passengers included:[16]\n In addition, 16 students and 5 adult chaperones from the French Club of the Montoursville Area High School in Pennsylvania were on board.[18][19]\n The NTSB was notified about 8:50pm the day of the accident; a full go team was assembled in Washington, D.C. and arrived on scene early the next morning.[1]:313 Meanwhile, initial witness descriptions led many to believe the cause of the crash was a bomb or surface-to-air missile attack.[20][21][22] The NTSB does not investigate criminal activity. The Attorney General is empowered to declare an investigation to be linked to a criminal act, and require the NTSB to relinquish control of the investigation to the FBI.[23] In the case of TWA 800, the FBI initiated a parallel criminal investigation alongside the NTSB's accident investigation.[24]\n Search and recovery operations were conducted by federal, state, and local agencies, as well as government contractors.[1]:363\u2013365 An HH-60 helicopter of the New York Air National Guard saw the explosion from approximately eight miles away, and arrived on scene so quickly that debris was still raining down, and the aircraft had to pull away. They reported their sighting to the tower at Suffolk County Airport (now Gabreski ANG Base). Remote-operated vehicles (ROVs), side-scan sonar, and laser line-scanning equipment were used to search for and investigate underwater debris fields. Victims and wreckage were recovered by scuba divers and ROVs; later scallop trawlers were used to recover wreckage embedded in the ocean floor.[1]:63 In one of the largest diver-assisted salvage operations ever conducted, often working in very difficult and dangerous conditions, over 95% of the airplane wreckage was eventually recovered.[24][25]:1 The search and recovery effort identified three main areas of wreckage underwater.[1]:65 The yellow zone, red zone, and green zone contained wreckage from front, center, and rear sections of the airplane, respectively.[1](pp65\u201374) The green zone with the aft portion of the aircraft was located the furthest along the flight path.[1](pp71\u201374)\n Wreckage recovered with tangled and damaged wires attached.[1](fig.24, p.80)\n Map showing the locations of the red, yellow, and green zones.[1](fig.22a, p.66)\n Wreckage found in each zone corresponded to specific areas of the aircraft.[1](fig.22b, p.67)\n The pathways the wreckage took as it fell to the ocean.[1](fig.22c, p.68)\n Pieces of wreckage were transported by boat to shore and then by truck to leased hangar space at the former Grumman Aircraft facility in Calverton, New York, for storage, examination, and reconstruction.[1]:63 This facility became the command center and headquarters for the investigation.[1]:363\u2013365 NTSB and FBI personnel were present to observe all transfers to preserve the evidentiary value of the wreckage.[1]:367 The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered by U.S. Navy divers 1 week after the accident; they were immediately shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C., for readout.[1]:58 The victims' remains were transported to the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's Office in Hauppauge, New York.[26]:2\n Relatives of TWA 800 passengers and crew, as well as the media, gathered at the Ramada Plaza JFK Hotel.[27] Many waited until the remains of their family members had been recovered, identified, and released.[28]:1[29](pp3\u20134) This hotel became known as the \"Heartbreak Hotel\" for its role in handling families of victims of several airliner crashes.[30][31] The New York Daily News wrote that for the families the hotel became \"a makeshift grief counseling center\".[32]\n Grief turned to anger at TWA's delay in confirming the passenger list,[27] conflicting information from agencies and officials,[33] and mistrust of the recovery operation's priorities.[34]:2 Although NTSB vice chairman Robert Francis stated that all bodies were being retrieved as soon as they were spotted, and that wreckage was being recovered only if divers believed that victims were hidden underneath,[34]:2 many families were suspicious that investigators were not being truthful, or withholding information.[34]:2[35]:7[36]:1\u20132\n Much anger and political pressure was also directed at Suffolk County Medical Examiner Dr. Charles V. Wetli as recovered bodies backlogged at the morgue.[25]:3[35]:5[36]:1\u20132 Under constant and considerable pressure to identify victims with minimal delay,[26]:3 pathologists worked non-stop.[35]:5 Since the primary objective was to identify all remains rather than performing a detailed forensic autopsy, the thoroughness of the examinations was highly variable.[26]:3 Ultimately, remains of all 230 victims were recovered and identified, the last over 10 months after the crash.[26]:2\n With lines of authority unclear, differences in agendas and culture between the FBI and NTSB resulted in discord.[35]:1 The FBI, from the start assuming that a criminal act had occurred,[35]:3 saw the NTSB as indecisive. Expressing frustration at the NTSB's unwillingness to speculate on a cause, one FBI agent described the NTSB as \"No opinions. No nothing.\"[35]:4 Meanwhile, the NTSB was required to refute or play down speculation about conclusions and evidence, frequently supplied to reporters by law enforcement officials and politicians.[25]:3[35]:4 The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW), an invited party to the NTSB investigation, criticized the undocumented removal by FBI agents of wreckage from the hangar where it was stored.[37]\n Although there were considerable discrepancies between different accounts, most witnesses to the accident had seen a \"streak of light\" that was unanimously described as ascending,[1]:230 moving to a point where a large fireball appeared, with several witnesses reporting that the fireball split in two as it descended toward the water.[1]:3 There was intense public interest in these witness reports and much speculation that the reported streak of light was a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to explode.[1]:262 These witness accounts were a major reason for the initiation and duration of the FBI's criminal investigation.[39]:5\n Approximately 80 FBI agents conducted interviews with potential witnesses daily.[39]:7 No verbatim records of the witness interviews were produced; instead, the agents who conducted the interviews wrote summaries that they then submitted.[39]:5 Witnesses were not asked to review or correct the summaries.[39]:5 Included in some of the witness summaries were drawings or diagrams of what the witness observed. Witnesses were not allowed to testify at the court hearings.[38]:165[40]:184\n Within days of the crash the NTSB announced its intent to form its own witness group and to interview witnesses to the crash.[39]:6 After the FBI raised concerns about non-governmental parties in the NTSB's investigation having access to this information and possible prosecutorial difficulties resulting from multiple interviews of the same witness,[39]:6 the NTSB deferred and did not interview witnesses to the crash. A Safety Board investigator later reviewed FBI interview notes and briefed other Board investigators on their contents. In November 1996, the FBI agreed to allow the NTSB access to summaries of witness accounts in which personally identifying information had been redacted and to conduct a limited number of witness interviews. In April 1998, the FBI provided the NTSB with the identities of the witnesses but due to the time elapsed a decision was made to rely on the original FBI documents rather than reinterview witnesses.[1]:229\n Examination of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder data showed a normal takeoff and climb,[13]:4 with the aircraft in normal flight[41]:2 before both abruptly stopped at 8:31:12\u00a0pm.[1]:3 At 8:29:15\u00a0pm the captain was heard to say, \"Look at that crazy fuel flow indicator there on number four... see that?\"[1]:2 A noise recorded on the last few tenths of a second of the CVR was similar to the last noises recorded from other airplanes that had experienced in-flight breakups.[1]:256 This, together with the distribution of wreckage and witness reports, all indicated a sudden catastrophic in-flight breakup of TWA 800.[1]:256\n Investigators considered several possible causes for the structural breakup: structural failure and decompression, detonation of a high-energy explosive device, such as a missile warhead exploding either upon impact with the airplane, or just before impact, a bomb exploding inside the airplane, or a fuel-air explosion in the center wing fuel tank.[1]:256\u2013257\n Close examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of structural faults such as fatigue, corrosion or mechanical damage that could have caused the in-flight breakup.[1]:257 It was also suggested that the breakup could have been initiated by an in-flight separation of the forward cargo door like the disasters on board Turkish Airlines Flight 981 or United Airlines Flight 811, but all evidence indicated that the door was closed and locked at impact.[1]:257 The NTSB concluded that \"the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a preexisting condition resulting in a structural failure and decompression.\"[1]:257\n A review of recorded data from long-range and airport surveillance radars revealed multiple contacts of airplanes or objects in TWA\u00a0800's vicinity at the time of the accident.[1]:87\u201389 None of these contacts intersected TWA 800's position at any time.[1]:89 Attention was drawn to data from the Islip, New York, ARTCC facility that showed three tracks in the vicinity of TWA 800 that did not appear in any of the other radar data.[1]:93 None of these sequences intersected TWA 800's position at any time either.[1]:93 All the reviewed radar data showed no radar returns consistent with a missile or other projectile traveling toward TWA 800.[1]:89\n The NTSB addressed allegations that the Islip radar data showed groups of military surface targets converging in a suspicious manner in an area around the accident, and that a 30-knot radar track, never identified and 3 nautical miles (5.6\u00a0km; 3.5\u00a0mi) from the crash site, was involved in foul play, as evidenced by its failure to divert from its course and assist with the search and rescue operations.[1]:93 Military records examined by the NTSB showed no military surface vessels within 15 nautical miles (28\u00a0km; 17\u00a0mi) of TWA\u00a0800 at the time of the accident.[1]:93 In addition, the records indicated that the closest area scheduled for military use, warning area W-387A/B, was 160 nautical miles (296\u00a0km; 184\u00a0mi) south.[1]:93\n The NTSB reviewed the 30-knot target track to try to determine why it did not divert from its course and proceed to the area where the TWA\u00a0800 wreckage had fallen. TWA\u00a0800 was behind the target, and with the likely forward-looking perspective of the target's occupant(s), the occupants would not have been in a position to observe the aircraft's breakup or subsequent explosions or fireball(s).[1]:94 Additionally, it was unlikely that the occupants of the target track would have been able to hear the explosions over the sound of its engines and the noise of the hull traveling through water, even more so if the occupants were in an enclosed bridge or cabin.[1]:94 Further, review of the Islip radar data for other similar summer days and nights in 1999 indicated that the 30-knot track was consistent with normal commercial fishing, recreational, and cargo vessel traffic.[1]:94\n Radar data showing vehicle and/or object tracks within 10 nautical miles (19\u00a0km; 12\u00a0mi) of TWA flight 800 just before the accident.[1](fig. 25, p. 90)\n Three sequences of primary returns near TWA 800 that were only recorded by the Islip radar.[1](fig. 26, p. 91)\n Primary radar returns that appeared near the TWA 800 after 8:31:12\u00a0pm. The 30-knot track is at the bottom center of the image.[1](fig. 27, p. 92)\n Trace amounts of explosive residue were detected on three samples of material from three separate locations of the recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI as a piece of canvas-like material and two pieces of a floor panel).[1]:118 These samples were submitted to the FBI's laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), another nitroglycerin, and the third a combination of RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN);[1]:118 these findings received much media attention at the time.[42][43] In addition, the backs of several damaged passenger seats were observed to have an unknown red/brown-shaded substance on them.[1]:118 According to the seat manufacturer, the locations and appearance of this substance were consistent with adhesive used in the construction of the seats, and additional laboratory testing by NASA identified the substance as being consistent with adhesives.[1]:118\n Further examination of the airplane structure, seats, and other interior components found no damage typically associated with a high-energy explosion of a bomb or missile warhead (\"severe pitting, cratering, petalling, or hot gas washing\").[1]:258 This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were found.[1]:258 Of the 5 percent of the fuselage that was not recovered, none of the missing areas were large enough to have covered all the damage that would have been caused by the detonation of a bomb or missile.[1]:258 None of the victims' remains showed any evidence of injuries that could have been caused by high-energy explosives.[1]:258\n The NTSB considered the possibility that the explosive residue was due to contamination from the aircraft's use in 1991 transporting troops during the Gulf War or its use in a dog-training explosive detection exercise about one month before the accident.[1]:258\u2013259 Testing conducted by the FAA's Technical Center indicated that residues of the type of explosives found on the wreckage would dissipate completely after two days of immersion in sea water (almost all recovered wreckage was immersed longer than two days).[1]:259 The NTSB concluded that it was \"quite possible\" that the explosive residue detected was transferred from military ships or ground vehicles, or the clothing and boots of military personnel, onto the wreckage during or after the recovery operation and was not present when the aircraft crashed into the water.[1]:259\n Although it was unable to determine the exact source of the trace amounts of explosive residue found on the wreckage, the lack of any other corroborating evidence associated with a high-energy explosion led the NTSB to conclude that \"the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a bomb or missile strike.\"[1]:259\n In order to evaluate the sequence of structural breakup of the airplane, the NTSB formed the Sequencing Group,[1]:100 which examined individual pieces of the recovered structure, two-dimensional reconstructions or layouts of sections of the airplane, and various-sized three-dimensional reconstructions of portions of the airplane.[1]:100 In addition, the locations of pieces of wreckage at the time of recovery and differences in fire effects on pieces that are normally adjacent to each other were evaluated.[1]:100 The Sequencing Group concluded that the first event in the breakup sequence was a fracture in the wing center section of the aircraft, caused by an \"overpressure event\" in the center wing fuel tank (CWT).[44]:29 An overpressure event was defined as a rapid increase in pressure resulting in failure of the structure of the CWT.[1]:85\n Because there was no evidence that an explosive device detonated in this (or any other) area of the airplane, this overpressure event could only have been caused by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT.[1]:261 There were 50\u00a0US\u00a0gal (190\u00a0L) of fuel in the CWT of TWA 800;[45] tests recreating the conditions of the flight showed the combination of liquid fuel and fuel/air vapor to be flammable.[1]:261 A major reason for the flammability of the fuel/air vapor in the CWT of the 747 was the large amount of heat generated and transferred to the CWT by air conditioning packs located directly below the tank;[1]:298 with the CWT temperature raised to a sufficient level, a single ignition source could cause an explosion.[1]:298\n Computer modeling[1]:122\u2013123 and scale-model testing[1]:123 were used to predict and demonstrate how an explosion would progress in a 747 CWT. During this time, quenching was identified as an issue, where the explosion would extinguish itself as it passed through the complex structure of the CWT.[1]:123 Because the research data regarding quenching was limited, a complete understanding of quenching behavior was not possible, and the issue of quenching remained unresolved.[1]:137\n In order to better determine whether a fuel/air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997, using a retired Air France 747 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield, England. These tests simulated a fuel/air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane/air mixture; this resulted in the failure of the tank structure due to overpressure.[1]:261 While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800 at the time of the accident,[1]:261 previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as Avianca Flight 203 and Philippine Airlines Flight 143 confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of an airplane.[1]:261\n Ultimately, based on \"the accident airplane's breakup sequence; wreckage damage characteristics; scientific tests and research on fuels, fuel tank explosions, and the conditions in the CWT at the time of the accident; and analysis of witness information,\"[1]:271 the NTSB concluded that \"the TWA flight 800 in-flight breakup was initiated by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT.\"[1]:63\n Recovery locations of the wreckage from the ocean (the red, yellow, and green zones) clearly indicated that: (1) the red area pieces (from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2) the forward fuselage section departed simultaneously with or shortly after the red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact for a period after the separation of the forward fuselage, and impacted the water in the green zone.[46]\n Fire damage and soot deposits on the recovered wreckage indicated that some areas of fire existed on the airplane as it continued in crippled flight after the loss of the forward fuselage.[1]:109 After about 34 seconds (based on information from witness documents), the outer portions of both the right and left wings failed.[1]:109, 263 Shortly after, the left wing separated from what remained of the main fuselage, which resulted in further development of the fuel-fed fireballs as the pieces of wreckage fell to the ocean.[1]:263\n Only the FAA radar facility in North Truro, Massachusetts, using specialized processing software from the United States Air Force 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron, was capable of estimating the altitude of TWA 800 after it lost power due to the CWT explosion.[1]:87 Because of accuracy limitations, this radar data could not be used to determine whether the aircraft climbed after the nose separated.[1]:87 Instead, the NTSB conducted a series of computer simulations to examine the flightpath of the main portion of the fuselage.[1]:95\u201396 Hundreds of simulations were run using various combinations of possible times the nose of TWA 800 separated (the exact time was unknown), different models of the behavior of the crippled aircraft (the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft without its nose could only be estimated), and longitudinal radar data (the recorded radar tracks of the east/west position of TWA 800 from various sites differed).[1]:96\u201397 These simulations indicated that after the loss of the forward fuselage the remainder of the aircraft continued in crippled flight, then pitched up while rolling to the left (north),[1]:263 climbing to a maximum altitude between 15,537 and 16,678 feet (4,736 and 5,083\u00a0m)[1]:97 from its last recorded altitude, 13,760 feet (4,190\u00a0m).[1]:256\n At the start of FBI's investigation, because of the possibility that international terrorists might have been involved, assistance was requested from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).[47]:2 CIA analysts, relying on sound-propagation analysis, concluded that the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail of burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion.[47]:5\u20136 This conclusion was reached after calculating how long it took for the sound of the initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the accident sequence.[47]:5 In all cases the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.[47]:6\n As the investigation progressed, the NTSB decided to form a witness group to more fully address the accounts of witnesses.[39]:7 From November 1996 through April 1997 this group reviewed summaries of witness accounts on loan from the FBI (with personal information redacted), and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a New York Air National Guard HH-60 helicopter and C-130 airplane, as well as a U.S. Navy P-3 airplane that was flying in the vicinity of TWA 800 at the time of the accident.[39]:7\u20138\n In February 1998, the FBI, having closed its active investigation, agreed to fully release the witness summaries to the NTSB.[39]:10 With access to these documents no longer controlled by the FBI, the NTSB formed a second witness group to review the documents.[39]:10 Because of the amount of time that had elapsed (about 21 months) before the NTSB received information about the identity of the witnesses, the witness group chose not to re-interview the witnesses, but instead to rely on the original summaries of witness statements written by FBI agents as the best available evidence of the observations initially reported by the witnesses.[1]:230 Despite the two and a half years that had elapsed since the accident, the witness group did interview the captain of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, who was the first to report the explosion of TWA 800, because of his vantage point and experience as an airline pilot.[39]:12\n The NTSB's review of the released witness documents determined that they contained 736 witness accounts, of which 258 were characterized as \"streak of light\" witnesses (\"an object moving in the sky... variously described [as] a point of light, fireworks, a flare, a shooting star, or something similar.\")[1]:230 The NTSB Witness Group concluded that the streak of light reported by witnesses might have been the actual airplane during some stage of its flight before the fireball developed, noting that most of the 258 streak of light accounts were generally consistent with the calculated flightpath of the accident airplane after the CWT explosion.[1]:262\n Thirty-eight witnesses described a streak of light that ascended vertically, or nearly so, and these accounts \"seem[ed] to be inconsistent with the accident airplane's flightpath.\"[1]:265 In addition, 18 witnesses reported seeing a streak of light that originated at the surface, or the horizon, which did not \"appear to be consistent with the airplane's calculated flightpath and other known aspects of the accident sequence.\"[1]:265 Regarding these differing accounts, the NTSB noted that based on their experience in previous investigations \"witness reports are often inconsistent with the known facts or with other witnesses' reports of the same events.\"[1]:237 The interviews conducted by the FBI focused on the possibility of a missile attack; suggested interview questions given to FBI agents such as \"Where was the sun in relation to the aircraft and the missile launch point?\" and \"How long did the missile fly?\" could have biased interviewees' responses in some cases.[1]:266 The NTSB concluded that given the large number of witnesses in this case, they \"did not expect all of the documented witness observations to be consistent with one another\"[1]:269 and \"did not view these apparently anomalous witness reports as persuasive evidence that some witnesses might have observed a missile.\"[1]:270\n After missile visibility tests were conducted in April 2000, at Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach, Florida,[1]:254 the NTSB determined that if witnesses had observed a missile attack they would have seen:\n Because of their unique vantage points or the level of precision and detail provided in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest:[1]:242\u2013243 the pilot of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a streak-of-light witness aboard US Airways Flight 217, a land witness on the Beach Lane Bridge in Westhampton Beach, New York, and a witness on a boat near Great Gun Beach.[1]:243\u2013247 Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some of these witnesses observed a missile;[1]:264 analysis demonstrated that the observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA\u00a0800, but instead were consistent with these witnesses having observed part of the in-flight fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion.[1]:264\n The NTSB concluded that \"the witness observations of a streak of light were not related to a missile and that the streak of light reported by most of these witnesses was burning fuel from the accident airplane in crippled flight during some portion of the post-explosion, preimpact breakup sequence\".[1]:270 The NTSB further concluded that \"the witnesses' observations of one or more fireballs were of the airplane's burning wreckage falling toward the ocean\".[1]:270\n In an attempt to determine what ignited the flammable fuel-air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely to have been the source of ignition.[1]:279\n Although the NTSB had already reached the conclusion that a missile strike did not cause the structural failure of the airplane, the possibility that a missile could have exploded close enough to TWA\u00a0800 for a missile fragment to have entered the CWT and ignited the fuel/air vapor, yet far enough away not to have left any damage characteristic of a missile strike, was considered.[1]:272 Computer simulations using missile performance data simulated a missile detonating in a location such that a fragment from the warhead could penetrate the CWT.[1]:273 Based on these simulations, the NTSB concluded that it was \"very unlikely\" that a warhead detonated in such a location where a fragment could penetrate the CWT, but no other fragments impact the surrounding airplane structure leaving distinctive impact marks.[1]:273\n Similarly, the investigation considered the possibility that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT could have been the ignition source.[1]:273 Testing by the NTSB and the British Defence Evaluation and Research Agency demonstrated that when metal of the same type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, there was petalling of the surface where the charge was placed, pitting on the adjacent surfaces, and visible hot gas washing damage in the surrounding area.[1]:273\u2013274 Since none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics, and none of the areas of missing wreckage were large enough to encompass all the expected damage, the investigation concluded that this scenario was \"very unlikely.\"[1]:274\n The NTSB also investigated whether the fuel/air mixture in the CWT could have been ignited by lightning strike, meteor strike, auto-ignition or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or static electricity.[1]:272\u2013279 After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were \"very unlikely\" to have been the source of ignition.[1]:279\n Because a combustible fuel/air mixture will always exist in fuel tanks, Boeing designers had attempted to eliminate all possible sources of ignition in the 747's tanks. To do so, all devices are protected from vapor intrusion, and voltages and currents used by the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) are kept very low. In the case of the 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT is that which is associated with the FQIS.\n In order for the FQIS to have been Flight 800's ignition source, a transfer of higher-than-normal voltage to the FQIS would have needed to occur, as well as some mechanism whereby the excess energy was released by the FQIS wiring into the CWT. While the NTSB determined that factors suggesting the likelihood of a short circuit event existed, they added that \"neither the release mechanism nor the location of the ignition inside the CWT could be determined from the available evidence.\" Nonetheless, the NTSB concluded that \"the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through the FQIS wiring\".\n Though the FQIS itself was designed to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800's FQIS compensator showed damage similar to that of the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976.[1]:293\u2013294 This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the center wing tank.[1]:288 Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.[1]:288\n The captain's cockpit voice recorder channel showed two \"dropouts\" of background power harmonics in the second before the recording ended (with the separation of the nose).[1]:289 This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the \"crazy\" readings of the number 4 engine fuel flow gauge about 2\u20091/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended.[1]:290 Finally, the Center Wing Tank fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated 640\u00a0pounds instead of the 300\u00a0pounds that had been loaded into that tank.[1]:290 Experiments showed that applying power to a wire leading to the fuel quantity gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before the circuit breaker trips. Thus the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a short to the FQIS wiring.[1]:290 The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short from damaged wiring, or within electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were recovered, it was not possible to pinpoint the source of the necessary voltage.\n The NTSB investigation ended with the adoption of its final report on August 23, 2000. In it the Board determined that the probable cause of the TWA 800 accident was:[1]:308\n [An] explosion of the center wing fuel tank (CWT), resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the CWT that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.\n In addition to the probable cause, the NTSB found the following contributing factors to the accident:[1]:308\n During the course of its investigation, and in its final report, the NTSB issued fifteen safety recommendations, mostly covering fuel tank and wiring-related issues.[1]:309\u2013312 Among the recommendations was that significant consideration should be given to the development of modifications such as nitrogen-inerting systems for new airplane designs and, where feasible, for existing airplanes.[48]:6\n The NTSB's conclusions about the cause of the TWA 800 disaster took four years and one month to be published. The FBI's earliest investigations and interviews, later used by the NTSB, were performed under the assumption of a missile attack, a fact noted in the NTSB's final report. Six months into the investigation, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, \"All three theories\u2014a bomb, a missile, or mechanical failure\u2014remain.\"[49] Speculation was fueled in part by early descriptions, visuals and eyewitness accounts of the disaster that indicated a sudden explosion and trails of fire moving in an upward direction.\n In 2014, the NTSB declined a petition to reopen the investigation.[50] In a press release, the NTSB stated: \"After a thorough review of all the information provided by the petitioners, the NTSB denied the petition in its entirety because the evidence and analysis presented did not show the original findings were incorrect.\"[51]\n Many internet users responded to the incident; the resulting web traffic set records for internet activity at the time. CNN's traffic quadrupled to 3.9 million hits per day. After the tragedy, the website of The New York Times saw its traffic increase to 1.5 million hits per day, 50% higher than its previous rate. In 1996, few U.S. government websites were updated daily, but the United States Navy's crash website was constantly updated and had detailed information about the salvage of the crash site.[52]\n The wreckage is permanently stored in an NTSB facility in Ashburn, Loudoun County, Virginia, that was custom-built for the purpose. The reconstructed aircraft is used to train accident investigators.[53][54]\n On July 18, 2008, the Secretary of Transportation visited the facility and announced a final rule designed to prevent accidents caused by fuel-tank explosions. The rule would require airlines to pump inert gas into the tanks, and will cover the centre-wing tank on all new passenger and cargo airliners, and passenger planes built in most of the 1990s, but not old cargo planes.[55] The NTSB had first recommended such a rule just five months after the incident and 33 years after a similar recommendation issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board Bureau of Safety on December 17, 1963, nine days after the crash of Pan Am Flight 214.[56]\n The crash of TWA Flight 800, and that of ValuJet Flight 592 earlier in 1996, prompted Congress to pass the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 as part of the federal aviation appropriations bill. Among other things, the Act gives NTSB, instead of the particular airline involved, responsibility for coordinating services to the families of victims of fatal aircraft accidents in the United States. In addition, it restricts lawyers and other parties from contacting family members within 30 days of the accident.[57]\n \nDuring the investigation, the NTSB and the FBI clashed with each other many times. The agencies needed a detailed protocol describing which agency takes the lead when it is initially unclear whether an event is an accident or a criminal act. 49 Code of Federal Regulations 831.5 specified in 1996 (as it does now) that the NTSB's aviation accident investigations have priority over all other federal investigations. After the TWA flight 800 investigation, the NTSB recognized the need for better clarity. The NTSB sought and secured language to clarify the issue in 49 USC 1131(a)(2)(B), which was amended in 2000 to read:  https://twa800.sites.usa.gov/improvements/\n In 2005, the NTSB and the FBI entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that states that, \u201c[i]n the immediate aftermath of a transportation accident, the NTSB is the presumptive lead investigative agency and will assume control of the accident scene.\u201d The FBI may still conduct a criminal investigation, but the NTSB investigation has priority. When investigative priority remains with the NTSB, the FBI must coordinate its investigative activities with the NTSB investigator-in-charge. This authority includes interviewing witnesses. The MOU states that: \u201c[t]his procedure is intended\u2026to ensure that neither NTSB nor FBI investigative activity unnecessarily complicates or compromises the other agency\u2019s investigation. The new statutory language and the MOU have improved coordination between the NTSB and FBI since the TWA flight 800 accident. Today, FBI and NTSB personnel conduct joint exercises. They can call upon one another\u2019s laboratories and other assets. The NTSB and the FBI have designated liaisons to ensure that information flows between agencies, and to coordinate on-scene operations.[58]\n Heidi Snow, the fianc\u00e9e of TWA800 victim Michel Breistroff, established the AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services (ACCESS) nonprofit group together with families of victims of Pan Am Flight 103.[59]\n The TWA Flight 800 International Memorial was dedicated in a 2-acre (8,100\u00a0m2) parcel immediately adjoining the main pavilion at Smith Point County Park in Shirley, New York, on July 14, 2004. The memorial is located at 40\u00b044\u203204\u2033N 72\u00b051\u203237\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff40.734509\u00b0N 72.860372\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.734509; -72.860372. Funds for the memorial were raised by the Families of TWA Flight 800 Association. David Busch of Busch Associates in Bay Shore, New York designed the memorial. The memorial includes landscaped grounds, flags from the 13 countries of the victims, and a curved Cambrian Black granite memorial with the names engraved on one side and an illustration on the other of a wave releasing 230 seagulls. In July 2006, an abstract design of a 10-foot-high (3.0\u00a0m) lighthouse in black granite designed by Harry Edward Seaman, who had lost his cousin in the crash, was added. The lighthouse sits above a tomb holding many of the victims' personal belongings.[60] The 567 Air Force Band of the Northeast played the dedication, performing an arrangement of Brahms \"Blessed are They\" while all victims names were read aloud.\n \u00a0This article incorporates\u00a0public domain material from websites or documents of the National Transportation Safety Board.", " \n Stephen David Stubbings (born 31 March 1978 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire) is an English cricketer and coach who played first-class and List A cricket for Derbyshire from 1998 to 2009 and minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire (2011-2013).\n He only played a handful of senior games before trying out at the Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club in the Victorian Cricket Association's Premier Competition.

Two years later, in 1996, they released their second studio album Stormbl\u00e5st (English: Stormblown) under Cacophonous and was their final album sung entirely in Norwegian until its re-recording in 2005 under Nuclear Blast. The band's first release under Nuclear Blast was their third studio album Enthrone Darkness Triumphant and was also their first album to make it into the charts; peaking in its seventh week in the Finnish charts at number 26[1] and debuting in the German charts at number 75.[2] Before the release of their fourth studio album, Spiritual Black Dimensions; in 1999, Dimmu Borgir released the compilation album Godless Savage Garden to, according to the band, \"hold fans over while waiting for the next full-length, Spiritual Black Dimensions.\"[3] Two years later, in 2001, they released their fifth studio album, Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia, and a further two years later their sixth and first album to chart in the United States;[4] Death Cult Armageddon. In 2005 the band released the rerecording of their second studio album under the title Stormbl\u00e5st MMV followed by their first concept album In Sorte Diaboli, in 2007, which debuted in at number one in the Norwegian album charts[5] and at number 43 in the Billboard 200, making them the first Norwegian band since a-ha to crack the United States Top 50.[6] As of 2010, Dimmu Borgir had sold over 400,000 albums in the United States.[7][8]\n", " Non-State Opponents\n Ansar Dine (Arabic: \u0623\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u200e \u02beAn\u1e63\u0101r ad-D\u012bn, also transliterated An\u00e7ar Deen; meaning \"helpers of the (Islamic) religion\" or \"defenders of the faith\")[2] also known as Ansar al-Din (abbreviated as AAD)[3] is a militant Islamist group led by Iyad Ag Ghaly, one of the most prominent leaders of the Tuareg Rebellion (1990\u20131995) who is suspected of having ties to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which is led by his cousin Hamada Ag Hama. Ansar Dine seeks to impose strict Sharia law across Mali.[4][5] The group's first action was in March 2012. The organization is not to be confused with the Sufi movement An\u00e7ar Dine, started in Southern Mali by Ch\u00e9rif Ousmane Haidara in the 1980s, which is fundamentally opposed to militant Islamism.[6][7]  Ansar Dine is opposed to Sufi shrines.[8]\n Ansar Dine has its main base among the Ifora tribe from the southern part of the Tuaregs' homeland.[9] It has been linked with Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) because its leader Iyad Ag Ghaly is the cousin of AQIM commander Hamada Ag Hama.[5] In April 2012, Salma Belaala, a professor at Warwick University who does research on jihadism in North Africa said that this association was false, claiming that Ansar Dine was opposed to Al\u00a0Qaeda.[10] Ag Ghaly was also previously associated with the 1990 Tuareg rebellion.[5] The group's members are reported to be from Mali, Algeria, and Nigeria.[11] Omar Ould Hamaha, who served as Ansar Dine's spokesman after April 2012, became the military leader of the AQIM-affiliated Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA) in August 2012.[12]\n On 24 January 2013, a faction calling itself the Islamic Movement for the Azawad split from Ansar Dine. As of January 2013, this group was led by prominent Tuareg leader Alghabass Ag Intalla.[13][14]\n In March 2013 it was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Department of State,[15] and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the United Nations Security Council.[16]\n In Mopti, the Ansar Dine fighters obtained access to heavy construction equipment from fleeing construction workers and used them to build fighting positions. The fighting positions include an elaborate tunnel network and vehicular obstacles such as trenches.[17]\n Ansar Dine has reportedly put together at least one convoy of 100 vehicles carrying soldiers equipped with small arms.[18] There have also been rumors that fighters may have been able to obtain weapons from Libya's weapons depots after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.[19] The Ansar Dine arsenal also includes anti aircraft weapons which can be mounted on pickup trucks.[20][21]\n The group seeks to impose sharia law across Mali, including the Azawad region. Witnesses have said that Ansar Dine fighters wear long beards and fly black flags with the Shahada (Islamic creed) inscribed in white.[22][23][24] According to different reports, unlike the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), Ansar Dine does not seek independence but rather to keep Mali intact and convert it into a rigid theocracy.[25][26]\n On 21 March 2012, the group claimed control of Mali's vast northeast regions. The Agence France-Presse reported that Ansar Dine claimed to occupy the towns of Tinzaouaten, Tessalit, and Aguelhok, all close to the Algerian border, and that they had captured at least 110 civilian and military prisoners.[27] France accused the group of summarily executing 82 soldiers and civilians in capturing Aguelhok, describing the group's tactics as \"Al-Qaeda-style\".[27]\n On 22 March, mutineering Malian soldiers unhappy with Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 overthrew the Malian government in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Taking advantage of Malian disarray, Ansar Dine and MNLA proceeded to take the towns of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu within the following ten days. According to Jeremy Keenan of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Ansar Dine's military contribution was slight compared to the much larger MNLA: \"What seems to happen is that when they move into a town, the MNLA take out the military base\u2014not that there's much resistance\u2014and Iyad [Ag Aghaly] goes into town and puts up his flag and starts bossing everyone around about sharia law\".[28]\n On 3 April, the BBC reported that the group had started implementing Sharia law in Timbuktu.[25] That day, Ag Ghaly gave a radio interview in Timbuktu announcing that Sharia would be enforced in the city, including the veiling of women, the stoning of adulterers, and the punitive mutilation of thieves. According to Timbuktu's mayor, the announcement caused nearly all of Timbuktu's Christian population to flee the city.[29] On 6 April, the MNLA issued a declaration of independence. However, the military wing of Ansar Dine rejected it hours after it was issued.[30]\n Ansar Dine was reportedly responsible for the burning of the tomb of a Sufi saint, a UNESCO World Heritage site, on 4 May in Timbuktu.[31] The group also blocked a humanitarian convoy bringing medical and food aid from reaching Timbuktu on 15 May, objecting to the presence of women in the welcoming committee set up by city residents;[32] after negotiations, the convoy was released on the following day.[33] In Gao, the group reportedly banned video games, Malian and Western music, bars, and football.[32]\n On 26 May, the MNLA and Ansar Dine announced a pact in which they would merge to form an Islamist state called the \"Islamic Republic of Azawad\".[34]\n However, some later reports indicated that the MNLA had decided to withdraw from the pact, distancing itself from Ansar Dine.[35][36] MNLA and Ansar Dine continued to clash,[37] culminating in the Battle of Gao on 27 June, in which Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa and Ansar Dine took control of the city, driving out the MNLA. The following day, Ansar Dine announced that it was in control of all the cities of northern Mali.[38]\n In the summer of 2012, members of Ansar Dine broke down the doors of the Sidi Yahya Mosque, which, according to legend, were not to be opened until the Last Days. They claimed that reverence for the site was idolatrous, but offered roughly $100 U.S.\u00a0dollars to repair the mosque.[39]\n Ansar Dine was in peace talks with Mali's neighbours Burkina Faso and Algeria.[40]\n In late January 2013, during the French Operation Serval against the Islamist fighters in Northern Mali, a faction split off from Ansar Dine, led by Alghabass Ag Intalla(h). It calls itself the Islamic Movement of Azawad (MIA) and claims to be ready for negotiations and to reject extremism and terrorism as well as any association with Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.[41][42][43]\n In March 2017, Iyad Ag Ghaly appeared in a video, alongside leaders from the Saharan branch of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Mourabitoun and the Macina Liberation Front, in which it was announced their groups were merging under Ag Ghaly's leadership, in an organisation called Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin.[1][44]\n", " \n Thomas Edwards VC (19 April 1863 \u2013 27 March 1953) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\n He was 20 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders), British Army during the Mahdist War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.\n On 13 March 1884 at the Battle of Tamai, Sudan, when both members of the crew of one of the Gatling guns had been killed, Private Edwards, after bayoneting two Arabs and himself receiving a wound from a spear, remained with the gun, defending it throughout the action.

He had professional status and later became a popular author and broadcaster. He was born in Stainton, West Riding of Yorkshire, and died in Steeton with Eastburn, West Yorkshire. He appeared in 603 first-class matches, including 67 Test matches, as a right-handed batsman who bowled right arm fast.\n Generally acknowledged to have been one of the greatest bowlers in cricket's history, Trueman deployed a genuinely fast pace and was widely known as \"Fiery Fred\". He was the first bowler to take 300 wickets in a Test career.[1] Together with Brian Statham, he opened the England bowling for many years and they formed one of the most famous bowling partnerships in Test cricket history. Trueman was an outstanding fielder, especially at leg slip, and a useful late order batsman who made three first-class centuries. He was awarded his Yorkshire county cap in 1951 and in 1952 was elected \"Young Cricketer of the Year\" by the Cricket Writers' Club. For his performances in the 1952 season, he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1953 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.\n His talent, skill and popularity were such that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson jokingly described him as the \"greatest living Yorkshireman\". Even so, Trueman was omitted from numerous England teams because he was frequently in conflict with the cricket establishment which he often criticised for its perceived \"snobbishness\" and hypocrisy. After he retired from playing, he became a media personality through his work in television and as an outspoken radio commentator and summariser for the BBC, mainly working on Test Match Special. He was awarded the OBE in the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to cricket.\n Fred Trueman was born at no. 5, Scotch Springs, Stainton near Maltby, West Riding of Yorkshire.[2] He said himself that he weighed 14\u00a0lb 1\u00a0oz (6.4\u00a0kg) at birth and was delivered by his grandmother Mrs Stimpson.[3] Her maiden name was Sewards and Trueman's parents decided to honour her by naming him Frederick Sewards Trueman.[2] Not long before his death in 2006, Trueman discovered that Mrs Stimpson was Jewish, making him Jewish according to Jewish law.[4] He said that he was happy to be considered Jewish but joked that he would not give up on bacon sandwiches.[5]\n His parents were Alan and Ethel Trueman and he was the middle one of seven children. They were a country family, their home being part of a terrace row called Scotch Springs (now demolished) that was surrounded by countryside but about a mile from Maltby Main Colliery and half a mile from Stainton village. Trueman's grandfather had been a horse dealer and his father worked primarily with horses too, though for a time he was a coalface worker at Maltby Main. His parents instilled into all the children a strong sense of discipline and the values of honesty and forthrightness.[6]\n Trueman's education began at the village school in Stainton where his teachers recognised his talent for cricket.[7] Encouraged by his father, he had started bowling when he was four. His father was captain of the Stainton club and Trueman used to accompany him to matches, once playing for the club when he was only eight years old.[8] When Trueman was twelve years old, the family moved to a larger house on Tennyson Road in nearby Maltby, where Trueman attended Maltby Secondary School.[9]\n At Maltby Secondary School, Trueman had two teachers called Dickie Harrison and Tommy Stubbs who recognised his talent as a bowler and picked him for the school team, even though he was much younger than the other players.[9] His school playing career was interrupted for two years after he was seriously injured by a ball that hit him in the groin. He started playing again in 1945 when he was fourteen but left school that summer to start work, initially in a newsagent's shop. He had several jobs before becoming a professional cricketer.[10] Inhibited by his injury, Trueman might have given up on cricket at this time but instead, motivated by his family, he joined a nearby village club called Roche Abbey, playing regularly for them in 1946.[10] He was successful at Roche Abbey and, before the 1947 season when he was sixteen, came to the notice of former Yorkshire player Cyril Turner who was coaching the Sheffield United Cricket Club which played at Bramall Lane, a ground then in regular use by Yorkshire for first-class cricket.[11][12]\n In his autobiography, Trueman acknowledged his debt to Cyril Turner, \"a superb coach\", who taught him how to \"hold the ball properly\", enable it to swing both ways and how to follow through properly to complete his bowling action.[13] Trueman played some matches for Sheffield United's Second XI team in the 1947 season and was then promoted to the first team so that he could play in the Yorkshire Council League.[14] The following winter, he received an invitation from Yorkshire to attend indoor coaching classes at Headingley, Leeds, under the supervision of Bill Bowes and Arthur Mitchell.[14]\n Before the 1948 season began, Trueman was selected by Yorkshire for the Yorkshire Federation team for players under eighteen, effectively the county's third team.[15] The team toured the south of England and it was on this tour that Trueman met two of his future Yorkshire colleagues, Brian Close and Ray Illingworth.[16] He enjoyed a successful season with Sheffield, saying that \"the year 1948 proved a good one for me\".[16] He had already met a number of great Yorkshire players including George Hirst and he was delighted by an end of season newspaper report in which Herbert Sutcliffe predicted that Trueman would play for Yorkshire before he was nineteen and for England before he was twenty-one.[17]\n As the 1949 season began, Trueman was surprised to receive a telegram from Yorkshire which told him he had been chosen to play for the first team in the opening first-class matches against Cambridge University at Fenner's and Oxford University at the Parks.[18]\n Trueman made his first-class debut on Wednesday, 11 May 1949 in the three-day match against Cambridge which Yorkshire won by 9 wickets. He was mistakenly described as a spin bowler in the Wisden match report.[19] Opening the bowling in both innings with Brian Close, who was medium pace, Trueman took two for 72 and one for 22 as Cambridge were dismissed for 283 and 196 respectively. Yorkshire scored 317 for six declared and 164 for one so Trueman, who was number 11 in the order, did not bat. Trueman's first wicket was that of opening batsman Robert Morris, who was caught by Ellis Robinson for 19. In the second innings, Trueman bowled the future Sussex and England batsman Hubert Doggart for 23. Three other debutants that day who all became England players were Close and opening batsman Frank Lowson for Yorkshire; and Middlesex fast bowler John Warr for Cambridge. Many years later, Warr wrote the biographical piece about Trueman in Barclays World of Cricket.[20] Trueman had match figures of six for 72 in his second match against Oxford, which Yorkshire lost by 69 runs.[21] A month later, he took eight for 70 against the Minor Counties on his first appearance at Lord's, bowling unchanged through the second innings.[22] Commenting on his first County Championship match, against Surrey at Park Avenue, Bradford, Wisden said that he bowled \"fast and with effect\".[23]\n As with most of their young players, Yorkshire intended to take their time over establishing Trueman and were prepared to set him aside for lengthy periods. The established pace bowlers in 1949 were Alec Coxon and Ron Aspinall, both fast-medium, while captain Norman Yardley was a \"capable third seam bowler\".[24] History was against Trueman as the county rarely looked for fast bowlers with express speed, instead preferring \"the medium or fast-medium bowler with his capacity for control, economy and long spells\". Trueman, once he became established, was a clear breach of Yorkshire tradition.[25]\n The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.[26]\n Yorkshire initially replaced Aspinall with Frank McHugh but then brought Trueman back in June before dropping him in July in order to try out Foord and Whitehead.[27] Trueman was recalled to play against the New Zealand tourists at Bramall Lane later in July but his debut season ended there and then as he sustained a thigh injury and had to be carried off the field.[21][28] He could only watch from the sidelines as Yorkshire took part in \"a fine struggle\" for the championship which, in the end, they shared with Middlesex, both teams earning 192 points.[29] He played in eight first-class matches in 1949, all for Yorkshire; in five matches for the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship; and in one other match for Yorkshire's first team against an Army XI which included another up and coming fast bowler, Frank Tyson.\n The third issue of Playfair Cricket Annual in 1950 said that Trueman was \"built for the job of a fast 'un, and with the spirit too\" but added that \"Yorkshire will not hasten his development or that of any other promising player\".[30] Trueman in his autobiography was highly critical of this policy and says that on at least one occasion he remonstrated fiercely with his captain about being left out of the first team.[31] Having called him a \"fast 'un\" in its Yorkshire section, Playfair in its \"Who's Who\" section incorrectly described Trueman as \"a promising RFM\" (i.e., fast medium bowler).[32] Trueman's oft-stated view of himself was \"t'fastest bloody bowler that ever drew breath\".[33]\n Trueman's first match in the 1950 season was for Yorkshire against the West Indies tourists at Park Avenue. He made twelve appearances in the County Championship and played for \"The Rest\" against England in a Test trial. He made only one appearance for the Second XI. On the face of it, and certainly in terms of his bowling figures to date, it was a surprise that Trueman was selected for the Test Trial.[34] Wisden said that this was \"a match immortalised by Jim Laker's eight for two\".[35] Trueman's inclusion was designed to give the England batsmen practice against fast bowling even though, at this period of his career, he was inaccurate in both length and direction.[36] The selectors were driven by the repeated discomfiture of England batsmen against the great Australian bowlers Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, but John Arlott suspected there was also a subconscious urge to \"reflect public feeling, the national desire for a fast bowler, even an inexperienced one \u2013 anyone so long as he was fast\".[37]\n 1950 was a frustrating season for Trueman who was straining to establish himself in the Yorkshire team. The club committee, however, persisted in a policy of short-term usage followed by a period of discard while they looked at Whitehead. Trueman faced the added problem of trying to succeed in an atmosphere of prevailing \"discontent in the dressing room\" which amounted to much more than a typical \"them and us\" situation between players and committee.[38] Trueman said that the team itself was \"split into cliques\", specifically the \"gentlemen players\" and one or two senior professionals like Hutton, who had social ambitions, on the one hand; and the younger professionals like himself, Close, Illingworth and Lowson on the other. The situation was exacerbated by bad feeling between some of the professionals, Wardle in particular being a difficult person to have in a team.[39] Although he was fast, Trueman was often wayward and sometimes expensive. These \"negatives assumed great importance\" in such a dour and unforgiving atmosphere.[35] On Trueman's debit side, some of his colleagues perceived him to be \"loud-mouthed and seemingly insensitive\".[35]\n Trueman was downhearted enough at this time to even think about joining Yorkshire's traditional rivals Lancashire.[35] But at the end of the season, he went back to the winter nets where he listened to Bowes and Mitchell, practised, kept himself fit and looked forward with increasing determination to the future.[40] Trueman was an \"apt pupil\" and Bowes said of him: \"He had the three great assets for the job: a love of fast bowling, a powerful physique and a smooth cartwheel action\".[36]\n Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship, twenty points adrift of the joint winners Lancashire and Surrey.[41] For the most part, Yorkshire selected from fifteen players in 1950 although a few others made occasional appearances. Yardley captained the team in which Hutton and Lowson were the established openers although, with Hutton's Test calls, there were more opportunities for Halliday and Geoffrey Keighley. Lester, Watson, Wilson and Billy Sutcliffe were the other batsmen and Brennan was the wicket-keeper. The main bowlers were Wardle, Coxon and Eddie Leadbeater. Brian Close was doing his national service and could only make a single appearance, Ellis Robinson had departed and Ron Aspinall's career had been wrecked by his injury. So Trueman and Whitehead, who made 13 appearances, contested the fourth bowling place but one of the bit players was Bob Appleyard, who would make a major impact in 1951.\n The next stage in Trueman's development was to harness his speed and exercise full control of the ball. This was what Bowes and Mitchell worked on in 1950\u201351 and \"the improvement in his bowling was immediately noticeable\".[42] Whereas in 1949 and 1950 he had taken 31 wickets in both seasons, he took 90 in 1951 including five wickets in an innings six times. His best analysis of the season was eight for 53 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge when he captured his first hat-trick by making the ball swing with devastating effect, Yorkshire winning by 9 wickets. His hat-trick victims were Reg Simpson, Alan Armitage and Peter Harvey.[43]\n All four of Trueman's career hat-tricks were taken for Yorkshire and this is a county record he shares with George Macaulay.[21] The hat-trick match was the second time Trueman had destroyed the Nottinghamshire batting that season. A month earlier at Bramall Lane, he had taken three for 26 and eight for 68, enabling Yorkshire to win by an innings and 33 runs. According to Wisden, Trueman \"bowled at very fast pace and frequently made the ball fly\".[21]\n Trueman might have expected that eleven-wicket haul at Bramall Lane to firmly establish his place in the Yorkshire first-team but his immediate reward was to be rested and given twelfth man duties with the Second XI, who were playing against Lincolnshire at Cleethorpes Sports Ground.[31] To be fair to Yorkshire, the teams for the subsequent first and second XI matches had already been chosen before he took his eight for 68.[35] He quickly swallowed his disappointment and his eight for 53 at Trent Bridge was summarised by one of his biographers Don Mosey as \"the start of the Trueman era\".[35]\n Despite their internal problems and disharmony, Yorkshire finished second behind Warwickshire in the County Championship.[44] One of the problem players, Alex Coxon, surprisingly resigned after the 1950 season and it was widely said that \"his face did not fit\", even though he was a top-class bowler who had played for England.[45] Brian Close made only two appearances as he completed his national service; and Ray Illingworth made his debut but played in only the one match. With Johnny Whitehead playing only seven times, Yorkshire relied mainly on a squad of 13 players including Trueman, who played in 26 championship matches. The other twelve regulars were Yardley (captain), Hutton, Lowson, Lester, Watson, Wilson, Halliday, Sutcliffe, Brennan, Wardle, Leadbeater and Appleyard. On Monday, 13 August 1951, Trueman and Bob Appleyard were awarded their county caps by team captain Norman Yardley.[46]\n Since his first involvement with Yorkshire in 1948, Trueman had been working a winter job at Maltby Main in the tally office (contrary to one of the urban myths about him, he was never actually a miner).[47] Yorkshire had encouraged him to work for the National Coal Board so that he would be in a reserved occupation and so avoid national service.[48] In the winter of 1950\u201351, he learned that his job was to be declassified and that he would be liable for call-up at some stage. He decided to volunteer after the 1951 season and, at the same time, take advantage of a new Yorkshire committee ruling that any capped players who were called up would be paid \u00a35 a week, which was a good wage at the time.[47]\n Trueman undertook his national service in the Royal Air Force at RAF Hemswell in Lincolnshire. At that stage, according to Wisden, \"the RAF was probably less hierarchical than Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and he coped with the vagaries of service life rather better than he did with the Yorkshire committee\".[35] He was there through the next two seasons until he was demobilised at the end of the 1953 season. During this time he made his Test debut for England against India in 1952 and took part in the 1953 Ashes series against Australia.\n He was fortunate in having a station commander in Group Captain Jim Warfield who was a cricket enthusiast and was willing to grant him leave for Test and occasional county matches. In addition, Warfield decided to employ Trueman in the sports section, looking after the equipment and playing fields.[49] Nevertheless, this relaxation of the usual rules caused questions to be raised in the House of Commons after the mother of another conscript complained to her local MP that her son had been refused leave to take part in a national banjo playing championship. Trueman claimed that he was the first person to be mentioned in Hansard in a cricketing connection.[50] His identity in the RAF was AC2 F. S. Trueman 2549485. He was later promoted to AC1.[42]\n National service restricted Trueman to just nine first-class matches in 1952 but four of them were Tests. He made his debut for England on Thursday, 5 June in the first Test against India at Headingley. Len Hutton had been appointed England captain before the series as the first professional to hold the post in the 20th century and the first ever to hold it in a home series. The appointment was controversial, especially among the amateur establishment, but Hutton had \"an easy initiation against a weak Indian side, who did not relish the tearaway bowling of the young Trueman\".[51] England, for whom Trueman opened the bowling with Alec Bedser, won the match in four days by 7 wickets. After taking three for 89 in the first innings when India scored 293, Trueman produced a sensational opening spell in the second innings and, after only 14 balls had been bowled, India were reduced to none for four, Trueman taking three of the wickets. He finished with four for 27 as India recovered to score 165. England had made 334 in the first innings and a second innings total of 128 for three secured the win. England won the second Test at Lord's by 8 wickets. Trueman, again opening the bowling with Bedser, took four for 72 and four for 110. In the third Test at Old Trafford, England won by an innings and 207 runs with Trueman taking eight for 31 and one for 9. The fourth and final Test at the Oval was ruined by rain and drawn after England scored 326 for six declared and India had been bowled out for only 98. Trueman with five for 48 and Bedser with five for 41 were almost unplayable. Trueman's tally of wickets in his debut series was therefore 29.[35] He had a problem during the season in \"a tendency to get stitch\", which was diagnosed as \"a lack of regular fast bowling exercise\".[42]\n In the 1952 County Championship, Yorkshire made a strong challenge but ultimately finished as runners-up to Stuart Surridge's great Surrey team which began a remarkable run of seven consecutive titles to 1958.[52] Trueman was restricted to five championship appearances but Yorkshire did get Brian Close back from his national service. Yardley was again the captain and the other mainstays were Hutton, Lowson, Lester, Halliday, Wilson, Watson, Sutcliffe, Brennan, Wardle, Leadbeater and the fast-medium bowler Bill Holdsworth who was effectively Trueman's stand-in. Holdsworth played 24 matches in 1952 and 1953 only; but never again after Trueman returned to full-time action in 1954.\n As a result of his fine performances in 1952, mainly in Test cricket against India, Trueman was voted the Young Cricketer of the Year by the Cricket Writers' Club. The following spring, he was named as one of the Cricketers of the Year for 1952 by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in its 1953 edition (the other four were Harold Gimblett, Tom Graveney, David Sheppard and Stuart Surridge). Wisden said of Trueman in its dedication that he \"is 5 ft 10\u00bd in. and weighs 13st 9lbs\" and \"gives promise of becoming a second Harold Larwood\". Having mentioned his problem with \"stitch\", Wisden remarked that \"it is doubtful whether Trueman has reached the stage of physical development to bowl the long spells which may be necessary against Test batsmen of the highest class\". While Yorkshire thought Trueman would need two more seasons \"before he can do everything asked\", England certainly possess \"the best fast bowling prospect in years\" and Wisden followed this comment with a direct comparison of Trueman's attributes with those of Larwood.[42]\n Writing in 1999, Derek Birley said of Trueman at this pivotal moment in his career that he was \"still learning his craft and, rather more slowly, how to behave\".[51] Birley viewed Trueman as \"an early cricketing example of a post-war phenomenon, the brash and undisciplined youth tolerated for his talent \u2013 the anti-hero\".[51] Birley admitted that Trueman eventually became \"an immensely popular public figure\" thanks to his \"rudimentary sense of humour, prodigious memory and forthright views\", all of which made him a media favourite on the one hand but, on the other, the same qualities made him \"less popular on the county cricket circuit\", where he was \"dreaded off the field like the Ancient Mariner\".[51]\n Trueman played football for Lincoln City during his national service. He played for RAF Hemswell in the 1952\u201353 season and was spotted by Lincoln City manager Bill Anderson, who invited him to play for the Lincoln reserves. Trueman was a forward, playing either as a striker or on the wing. Given the publicity he had received after his performances in the 1952 Test series, there was a lot of public interest in his football and Lincoln's attendances increased considerably when he was playing. Eventually, Bill Anderson offered him professional terms but Trueman decided to concentrate on cricket and, aware of the risk to his Test and county career if he sustained a football injury, he declined.[53]\n The highlight of the 1953 season, for Trueman and all other England cricket followers, was the series victory over Australia that enabled England to win the Ashes for the first time since the bodyline series in 1932\u201333. Trueman missed the first four Tests, which were all drawn, and played in the last at the Oval which England won by 8 wickets, partly thanks to him taking four important wickets. \"Erratic, yes; wild, most certainly; but full of fire and dynamite\", wrote Jack Fingleton.[35]\n Yorkshire by contrast had a poor season, though it could partly be excused by the impact of Test calls, injuries and Trueman's national service. They dropped to twelfth place in the County Championship, which was then their lowest-ever position.[54] Ray Illingworth, who had made only a handful of appearances previously, was an ever-present in Yorkshire's championship team in 1953 and other young prospects making progress were Mike Cowan, Doug Padgett, Bryan Stott and Ken Taylor. Otherwise, the mainstays were as before: Yardley, Hutton, Lowson, Lester, Halliday, Watson, Wilson, Sutcliffe, Brennan and Wardle. Close played in only two matches and Trueman in ten. Bill Holdsworth made 14 appearances and Bill Foord, in his last season before finally deciding to be a schoolteacher, made 22.\n Trueman's first overseas tour, to the West Indies, took place the following winter (1953\u201354) after he was demobilised by the RAF. He played in eight first-class matches, including three of the five Tests, and took 27 wickets at 33.66 with a best effort of five for 45. It was a controversial tour and its ramifications had an adverse impact on Trueman's international career during the next few years. MCC at the outset were \"riddled with anxiety\" about sending a team abroad under a professional captain but could hardly deny Hutton his right having just won the Ashes.[55] England had a very strong team in which the main bowlers were Trevor Bailey, Jim Laker, Tony Lock, Johnny Wardle, Brian Statham and Trueman. On the other hand, there were some strong characters in the team coupled with weak management.[55]\n Hutton discouraged fraternisation with the West Indies players and this went decidedly against Trueman's grain, given that he was a gregarious character who liked nothing better than to fraternise.[55] Trueman had made friends with Frank Worrell and other West Indian players when he met them in English league cricket and objected strongly to Hutton's policy, claiming that he was not alone in this and especially as Hutton gave no reason for it. Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy (i.e., Allen, Brown, etc.) of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.[56] West Indian writer C. L. R. James commented on the 1953\u201354 English team that it was \"actively disliked\". He said that this was \"not due merely to unsportsmanlike behaviour by individuals\" but that there was \"evidence to show\" that the team was there primarily to \"establish the prestige of Great Britain, and by that, of the local whites\".[57]\n Trueman quickly alienated the West Indian crowds who disliked his belligerent style, especially when he followed instructions and did not show sympathy for batsmen he had hit with the ball.[55] The West Indian fans nicknamed him \"\"Mr Bumper Man\" and someone wrote a calypso about him that was based on the sea shanty Drunken Sailor.[35] He fell foul of off-field incidents too, including one in which he and Tony Lock were blamed for something done by Denis Compton who, as the \"golden boy\" of English cricket, was effectively beyond reproach.[58] It was while the team was in Barbados that one of the most repeated \"Trueman stories\" is said to have originated, although it is almost certainly apocryphal. At a dinner, Trueman is said to have ordered a local dignitary, apparently the Indian High Commissioner: \"Pass t'salt, Gunga Din\".[59] At the end of the tour, to his outrage, Trueman had his good-conduct bonus docked. No reason was given and he tried without success to obtain one, but neither Hutton nor MCC would elaborate. Trueman never forgave Hutton and the two never played together for England again.[60]\n Trueman played in the first Test at Sabina Park but, with figures of two for 107 and none for 32, he proved expensive and West Indies won by 140 runs. He was omitted from the team for both the second and third Tests but then recalled for the fourth at Queen's Park Oval which was drawn; Trueman again struggled and had a return of one for 131 in the first innings as West Indies amassed 681 for eight declared, all of the famous \"Three Ws\" scoring centuries: Everton Weekes 206, Frank Worrell 167 and Clyde Walcott 124. Trueman was retained for the final Test at Sabina Park which England won by nine wickets to square the series two apiece. He opened the bowling with Bailey and returned figures of two for 39 and three for 88, while Bailey produced a match-winning seven for 34 in the first innings when West Indies were all out for only 139.\n Back in England after the 1953\u201354 tour, Trueman in 1954 was able to play a full season for the first time since 1951. Jim Kilburn wrote that, at the age of 23, Trueman \"had acquired a man's physique for fast bowling that questioned the courage as well as the technique of opposing batsmen\".[61] He played in 33 matches and, for the first time, exceeded 100 wickets in a season. His tally was 134 at 15.55 with a best return of eight for 28. Yorkshire probably should have won the County Championship in 1954 having won six of their first seven matches but were badly hit by wet weather in August and finished runners-up behind Surrey.[62] Trueman and the medium-paced Appleyard formed an effective combination, backed up by Wardle's spin, and Yorkshire had a strong bowling side. The rest of the team mostly comprised Hutton, Lowson, Yardley, Lester, Watson, Vic Wilson, Close, Illingworth and wicket-keeper Roy Booth.\n Arlott mentions the hard work put in by Trueman to improve his bowling, first by \"smoothing out the last minor unevenness in his run-up\" and then by achieving increased accuracy.[63] Trueman said in his autobiography that Yorkshire in the early to mid-1950s were constantly let down by divisions in the team, blaming both Yardley and Hutton for the problems. Re the situation in 1954, he specifically mentions Yardley's inability to deal with the attitudes of Wardle and Appleyard.[64]\n Despite his excellent form for Yorkshire in 1954, there was no place for Trueman in any of the Test matches against Pakistan, nor was he selected for the tour of Australia and New Zealand the following winter. He became engaged to his first wife, Enid Chapman, in September 1954 and they married in March 1955. He worked as a furniture salesman through the winter months.[65]\n Trueman had a problem with so-called \"drag\" in 1955 when he was no-balled twice for not having his rear foot behind the bowling crease when he released the ball (i.e., he had dragged his back foot over the line before completing delivery). To remedy this, he reduced his run up by six yards, and with no apparent loss of pace.[66] Yorkshire were involved in a two-horse race for the County Championship but were again let down by one poor spell, this time in June, and had to settle for second place as Surrey won a fourth consecutive title.[67] With Appleyard ill, Trueman and Wardle shared the main weight of the bowling with support from Close. As Arlott points out, Yorkshire had a \"serious weakness\" in the lack of a regular fast bowling partner for Trueman. The situation was alleviated when Cowan was available, but his appearances were limited by national service and then by a back injury sustained on the MCC tour of Pakistan in 1955\u201356.[68] There were some signs of change, most notably with the arrival of Jimmy Binks as wicket-keeper and, with more appearances by Doug Padgett and Ken Taylor, the 1960s team was beginning to take shape. Appleyard, Hutton and Lester were less active than before. Otherwise, the mainstays with Trueman were Close, Illingworth, Lowson, Billy Sutcliffe, Wardle, Watson, Vic Wilson and Yardley.\n Trueman did force his way back into the England team for the second Test at Lord's in 1955, when England defeated South Africa by 71 runs. Opening the bowling with Statham, he took two for 73, which was expensive, and none for 39 while Statham won the match for England with two for 49 and a brilliant seven for 39. That was Trueman's only Test in 1955 as Frank Tyson was recalled for the third Test at Old Trafford. There was no Test tour in 1955\u201356 so Trueman had to wait a whole year for his next chance to play for England.\n The Australians visited England in 1956 and, Peter May having succeeded Hutton as England captain, Trueman was recalled for two Tests. In the second at Lord's, which Australia won by 185 runs, he opened the bowling with Statham and took two for 54 and five for 90. During the second innings, he took his 50th wicket in Test cricket when he had Keith Miller caught behind, but Miller had the last laugh as his ten-wicket haul won the match for Australia. Trueman had done enough to retain his place for the third Test at Headingley where England won by an innings and 42 runs. It was a spinner's wicket and 18 of the Australian wickets fell to Laker and Lock. Trueman opened the bowling with Bailey and took one for 19 and one for 21, dismissing Colin McDonald in both innings. Brian Statham returned for the now legendary fourth Test at Old Trafford, taking Trueman's place and opening the bowling with Bailey, but no pace bowlers were needed here for this was \"Laker's Match\", the Surrey off-spinner taking an unparalleled 19 wickets in the match.\n Trueman made 31 first-class appearances in 1956 but had difficulty with a persistent strain in his left side, exacerbated by occasional sciatica, and he reverted to his long run after more problems with drag at the start of the season.[66] Yorkshire's team underwent change before the season began with the retirements of Hutton and Yardley. Yardley was succeeded as captain by Billy Sutcliffe, with whom Trueman had a good relationship.[69] Rain badly affected the County Championship and Yorkshire managed only eight wins in their 28 matches to finish seventh.[70] With Trueman largely ineffective due to his injury, the bowling was carried by Appleyard, Wardle and the emerging Ray Illingworth.[66] Binks, Illingworth and Vic Wilson played in all of Yorkshire's 28 championship matches in 1956. The other essential players, besides Trueman when fit, were Appleyard, Close, Lowson, Padgett, Sutcliffe, Taylor, Wardle and Watson.\n Trueman was not included in the 1956\u201357 tour of South Africa, in which England relied for pace on Bailey, Statham, Tyson and Peter Loader. To keep his name in the frame, Trueman accepted an invitation to make a short tour of India with C. G. Howard's XI, which played two matches between 30 December and 8 January. Howard's team included Alec Bedser, Tom Graveney, Bill Edrich, Reg Simpson, Willie Watson and the Australians Bruce Dooland and Colin McCool. The two matches, played in Calcutta and Bombay, were to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of the Cricket Association of Bengal, Trueman taking eight wickets and achieving top score in one innings when he struck a rapid 46 not out.[71]\n In 1952, after Trueman's early success against India, Len Hutton had commented that he needed another five years to mature as a bowler; and it was in 1957 that Trueman returned to the fore and finally became an established England player.[72] He overcame his side strain and recovered his form, taking 27 wickets in his first four matches. New regulations about time-wasting caused him to reconsider his runup which he limited to eighteen yards.[73]\n Trueman was selected for the first Test against West Indies and kept his place for the entire series.[73] He was England's leading wicket-taker with 22 at 20.68. His great partnership with Statham began in earnest and for six years the pair were a formidable presence in international cricket, Statham noted for his accuracy and persistence, Trueman for his rhythm and dynamics.[74] Trueman's selection in this series can be put into some perspective by the fact that his great rival Frank Tyson achieved 100 wickets in a season for the first time, yet Trueman was now clearly considered England's best option to partner Statham.[73] As Arlott recounts, the third Test at Trent Bridge featured \"one of the finest sustained bowling performances of Trueman's life\".[75] In a high-scoring match which was eventually drawn, Trueman and Statham took 15 wickets between them from a combined 135 overs, which is a considerable total for two pace bowlers. In the context of the match, they were both outstanding and their joint performance was acclaimed as the first major success in a partnership that the selectors now regarded as long-term.[75] England did not have an overseas tour in the winter of 1957\u201358.\n Trueman played in 32 first-class matches in 1957, taking 135 wickets. He had an outstanding time in his favoured leg slip position, holding 36 catches. There were more problems in the Yorkshire dressing room, principally a petition started by certain players for the club committee to sack Billy Sutcliffe from the captaincy. Trueman refused to sign it but, in August, Sutcliffe decided to resign. Despite this, Yorkshire still managed to finish third, though a long way behind champions Surrey.[73] Yorkshire's main players in 1957 were Appleyard, Binks, Close, Illingworth, Lowson, Padgett, Sutcliffe, Taylor, Trueman, Wardle, Watson and Vic Wilson.\n Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new captain in 1958. Not an accomplished player, though he had previously captained the club's Second XI, he was a good man-manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get the best out of what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons.[76] The other \"trouble-maker\", Appleyard, lost his ability as a result of his illnesses and Yorkshire dropped him for good mid-season. Although the team could only finish 11th in the County Championship, having lost 24 full days to the weather, it was a much happier dressing room than it had been since 1946. Regular team members now included Binks, Brian Bolus, Burnet, Close, Cowan, Trueman, Illingworth, Lowson, Padgett, David Pickles, Phil Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was really beginning to take shape.[77]\n Trueman played in all five Tests against New Zealand in 1958, taking 15 wickets in the series at an average of 17.06. This was a wet summer and most of the bowling in the series was done by spinners, but he still managed five for 31 in the first Test at Edgbaston.[78] He pulled off a remarkable anticipatory catch in the Lord's Test when he stepped forward from his short leg position to catch the ball off a defensive stroke with his hand on the batsman's boot.[78] In the final Test at the Oval, he made the highest score of his whole Test career with 39* in twenty minutes, including three sixes off Alex Moir.[78]\n Despite sending what was, on paper, a very strong team on the 1958\u201359 tour of Australasia, England lost the Ashes to Richie Benaud's Australians, who won the series 4\u20130 with the third Test drawn. Tom Graveney recalled that \"it was a miserable tour (and England) were never a team\".[79] Graveney agreed with Trueman that the biggest problem was the tour manager, Brown, who \"did a very bad job\".[79] Graveney confirmed that Brown had been rude to several team members and \"was a very stuck-up individual, at least when he was sober\".[79] Brown tried to make trouble for Trueman from the outset of the tour but Trueman had learned a lot from his West Indian experience five years earlier and made a formal complaint about Brown to the team captain, Peter May. Although May was a public school-educated amateur like Brown, he supported Trueman and reprimanded Brown, telling him to \"act in a manner more befitting someone with managerial responsibility\".[80] For his part, Trueman described Brown as \"a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot\".[81]\n Trueman was one of several players who suffered injury or illness on the tour and missed the first Test because of a back problem. He was fit in time for the second Test but was not selected. He took part in the last three Tests, taking nine wickets with a best analysis of four for 90. At the Sydney Cricket Ground, he established an excellent rapport with the Australian spectators. The fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval was the only one in which Statham, Trueman and Tyson played together for England.[82] On the New Zealand leg of the tour, he played in all five first-class matches, including two Tests, and took 20 wickets.\n For the first time in Trueman's career, Yorkshire won the County Championship outright in 1959. He made a major contribution to that success as he took 140 wickets. Arlott wrote of Trueman's deep commitment to the Yorkshire cause in 1959, the title win being the achievement of a career ambition. Trueman owed personal loyalty to Burnet and had developed affinity with his younger colleagues.[83] The club's main players in 1959 were Binks, Bolus, Burnet, Close, Illingworth, Padgett, seamer Bob Platt, Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman and the Wilsons.\n England played India in the 1959 Test series and Trueman, whose selection problems were by now behind him, played in all five Tests. He bowled the most overs and took the most wickets, 24 at 16.70. The series was a poor contest, England winning all five Tests as India had a very weak team at the time.[84] The outcome of the series was evident in the first Test, which England won by an innings and 59 runs. Wisden records how England captain Peter May used his three pace bowlers Trueman, Statham and Alan Moss \"in short relays to keep them fresh\".[85] The tactics gave India \"no respite\" and Trueman, the main destroyer, \"always looked likely to tear through the whole side\".[85]\n When MCC toured the West Indies in 1959\u201360, England had a largely rebuilt team and were not expected to do well but several batsmen scored Test centuries and England won the series 1\u20130 with four matches drawn. In direct contrast to his previous visit to the Caribbean, this tour was Trueman's happiest and most successful, largely because he had an excellent relationship with the manager Walter Robins and did not have to put up with the likes of Allen and Brown.[86]\n In 1960, Vic Wilson having succeeded the retired Burnet as captain, Yorkshire won the Championship again but Kilburn wrote that they did so \"without laying any pretensions to being an outstanding side\".[87] Trueman's bowling by then contributed the team's main strength. He played in all five Tests that summer against South Africa yet still captured 150 wickets for Yorkshire, sometimes serving as a fast-medium bowler off a shortened run. His outstanding performance was taking seven in both innings against Surrey at the Oval.[87] Trueman's value to the team was illustrated by them, in Kilburn's words, \"having to wait for wickets when he was not in action\".[88] He made 32 first-class appearances and took 175 wickets, the highest season tally of his entire career, at the outstanding average of 13.98. Yorkshire's team in 1960 was mostly drawn from Binks, Jack Birkenshaw, Bolus, Close, Cowan, Illingworth, Padgett, Mel Ryan, Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman and the Wilsons.\n The 1960 Test series against South Africa was the first time Trueman and Statham bowled together throughout and Arlott wrote that they \"virtually won that Test rubber\". England won the first three Tests and, in these, Trueman and Statham shared 39 wickets. Their final tallies were Statham 27 and Trueman 25.[89] In its summary of the series, Wisden said that the South African batsmen did not come up to expectations because they could not handle Statham and Trueman.[90]\n Trueman played in the first four Tests against Australia in 1961 and, although he effectively won the third Test for England, they failed to regain the Ashes. Wisden said that the third Test, played at Headingley, should be remembered as \"Trueman's Match\" because \"two devastating spells by him caused Australia to collapse\". He took eleven wickets in the match for 88 runs, his best performance in Test cricket to date, and England won by eight wickets with two days to spare. Yorkshire finished second in the County Championship behind Hampshire, who won the title for the first time. Playfair said the Yorkshire team were looking distinctly jaded in the closing matches. Trueman and Illingworth were the outstanding bowlers for Yorkshire, both taking over 120 wickets in county matches.[91]\n In 1962, Yorkshire regained the County Championship title, but had to defeat Glamorgan on the final day of the season to secure the necessary points. Vic Wilson retired at the end of the season. The main players were Binks, Bolus, Close, Illingworth, Padgett, Ryan, Sharpe, Stott, Taylor, Trueman, Don Wilson and Vic Wilson. In another outstanding season of pace and swing, Trueman took 153 first-class wickets in 33 first-class appearances. He also scored 840 runs, which was the best season tally of his whole career but, because of inconsistency, he remained well short of the standard required if he was to be termed an all-rounder, though that is not something he ever pursued given his workload as a specialist bowler. In a five-Test series that year, England made short work of a Pakistan team that was weak in attack. As in 1961, Trueman played in the first four Tests but not the fifth Test at the Oval. He took 22 wickets in the series, his best match being the second Test at Lord's in which he took nine, the highlight being six for 31 in the first innings to bowl Pakistan out for only 100.[92]\n Trueman and Statham had taken 216 and 229 Test wickets respectively after the 1962 season so, when they toured Australia and New Zealand in 1962\u201363, both were poised to overtake the world record of 236 set by Alec Bedser, who was England's assistant-manager on the tour. Australian captain Richie Benaud was also in contention with 219 but, as expected, it was Statham who broke the record and he extended it to 242 wickets. Statham did not play in New Zealand and Trueman was then able to overtake him, extending the record to 250. The series was drawn, one win apiece, so Australia retained the Ashes. Trueman took three for 83 and five for 62 in England's victory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when captain Ted Dexter used him in short bursts, setting defensive fields until he could return.\n Although England were well beaten by Frank Worrell's outstanding West Indies team in 1963, Trueman had an outstanding series. After West Indies won the first Test at Old Trafford by ten wickets, many thought they would cruise to a series win but Trueman inspired an England fightback. The second Test at Lord's was a classic match in which all four results were possible until the last couple of balls but it ended in a draw. Trueman took eleven wickets in the match with six for 100 and five for 52. Richie Benaud, who had just joined BBC TV, said that Trueman \"showed wonderful control of swing and length\" in a \"magnificent\" performance.[93] In the third Test at Edgbaston, Trueman went one better by routing West Indies for England to win by 217 runs. He took five for 75 and seven for 44. In the second innings, he took the last six West Indian wickets in only 24 balls at a cost of four runs.[94][95] It was all to no avail, though, as West Indies won both the last two Tests to take the series by three Tests to one.\n Yorkshire retained the County Championship title in 1963. Tony Nicholson reinforced Yorkshire's faster bowling and provided Trueman with an able accomplice. In addition, Yorkshire's batting was considerably enhanced by the emergence of Geoff Boycott and John Hampshire. Trueman took 76 wickets in the Championship, 34 in Tests and 129 in all matches. By this time firmly in the category of senior cricketers, Trueman was well aware of his position and its implied privileges but realised that both his energies and his resolve had to be nurtured.[96] He captured five wickets in each innings when Yorkshire defeated West Indies at Acklam Park, eight for 45 against Gloucestershire at Bradford and, for England, had a match return of 12 for 119 at Edgbaston.[97] He scored two centuries, the first of his career, one against Northamptonshire which Kilburn described as \"timely in the context of the match\" and the other at the Scarborough Festival where he hit six sixes and 11 fours in 67 minutes.[97]\n Trueman was selected for the first three Tests against Australia in 1964, was omitted from the fourth and then recalled for the fifth in which he became the first bowler to capture 300 Test wickets. England again failed to recover the Ashes in a generally disappointing 1964 series which is only memorable for Trueman's unprecedented feat. On 15 August 1964, he reached the milestone when he had Neil Hawke caught by Colin Cowdrey at slip in the fifth Test at the Oval. Hawke, a good friend of Trueman off the field, was the first to congratulate him. The occasion produced one of Trueman's few concessions to fatigue when he was asked if he thought his record would ever be broken and he quipped: \"Aye, but whoever does it will be bloody tired\".[20] As Warr pointed out: \"This comment reveals the essence of the man. A touch of belligerence, a hint of humility, a pinch of roughness and an over-riding sense of humour\".[20] Meanwhile, Yorkshire lost the County Championship title which was won for the first time by a very strong Worcestershire team which starred Tom Graveney and featured Basil D'Oliveira, Norman Gifford and fast bowlers Len Coldwell and Jack Flavell. Trueman's overall achievements in 1964 did not meet his own high standards and his tally of exactly 100 wickets was well down on his totals in recent seasons.\n Trueman's Test career ended in 1965 after he had played in the first two of a three-match series against New Zealand. In Kilburn's view, Trueman's \"decline\" was \"not from skilful and purposeful and beautiful bowling but from devastating fast bowling\" and it may have been accelerated by the change in 1964 to the no-ball law which, he contends, impacted the rhythm of fast bowlers with long run-ups culminating in a long delivery stride.[98] Trueman continued to play first-class cricket for Yorkshire till the end of the 1968 season when his retirement was by his own decision.[98] He bowed out of Test cricket with a then world record of 307 wickets at an average of 21.54.\n Although he was the first bowler to take 300 Test wickets, he had undergone numerous clashes and problems with the England cricketing hierarchy and was not involved in the tours of Australia (1954\u201355); South Africa (1956\u201357) and (1964\u201365); India and Pakistan (1961\u201362); or India (1963\u201364). From the beginning to the end of his international career, England played 118 Tests and he missed 51 of them. He recalled in his memoirs: \"Irrespective of the fact I was at the top of my game for Yorkshire and frequently topped the county bowling averages, I was often overlooked for England. To my mind the reason for this was personal. Quite simply, some of the selection committee did not like my forthright attitude, which they misinterpreted as being \"bolshy\". Rather than pick the best eleven players for the job, the selection committee would often choose someone because he was, in their eyes, a gentleman and a decent chap. Such attributes often took precedence over someone's ability to play international cricket\".[99] He also wrote: \"For this reason I was selected for far fewer Tests than I believe I should have been. To my mind, if I'd had the opportunity to play in those Tests, I'm sure I would have topped 400 wickets. But that was not to be, even though I was regularly taking 100-plus wickets a season for Yorkshire\".[99]\n Trueman made 33 first-class appearances in 1966 and was able to focus on his county career, helping the team to win the first of three consecutive County Championships to 1968. He says he \"grew old gracefully (in cricketing terms)\".[100] He took 111 wickets, the twelfth and final time that he achieved 100 in a season. He made 31 first-class appearances in 1967 but greatly reduced his workload as a bowler, operating mainly in short spells. He had recognised that he could no longer maintain fast pace for the same time as he had done formerly, though he did comment on encountering \"any number of sluggish wickets that summer\".[101]\n In 1968, with Brian Close injured for a long period, Trueman was Yorkshire's acting captain in several matches and ensured that the team completed their hat-trick of titles. An event that gave Trueman considerable satisfaction was to lead Yorkshire to victory, by an innings and 69 runs, against a Test-strength Australian team at Bramall Lane. Trueman showed great tactical awareness throughout the match with a timely declaration of Yorkshire's innings and then ensuring that Australia faced slow bowlers only during periods of poor light. He himself took key wickets and Yorkshire, always in control, \"surged confidently to their victory\".[102] He followed his policy of the previous season by bowling in short spells.\n Following Yorkshire's victory over the Australians, Trueman decided to take stock of his career and decided that it was a good time to retire, so that he could \"bow out while still at the top\". As it happened, Brian Statham had announced that he would retire at the end of the season and Trueman decided to delay his own announcement after seeing the emotion of Statham's last match at Old Trafford. Trueman admitted that he would be unable to cope with a similar display of emotion by Yorkshire followers and postponed his announcement until well after the season had ended. He then quietly delivered a polite letter to the Yorkshire committee and so happily \"avoided a big farewell\"[103]\n Although he had officially retired, Trueman made one final first-class appearance in 1969 when he agreed to appear at the Scarborough Festival and play for the International Cavaliers against the touring Barbados team. He surprisingly reappeared in 1972 when he joined Derbyshire and played in six limited overs matches.\n For the details of this, see Playfair in 1969 and 1970. Trueman's autobiography has an extensive career stats appendix starting on page 381.\n In 603 first-class matches, Trueman scored 9,231 runs, including three centuries, with a highest score of 104 and held 439 catches. He took 2,304 wickets, including four hat-tricks, at an average of 18.27 with a best analysis of eight for 28. In 67 Test appearances, he scored 981 runs with a highest score of 39* and held 64 catches. He took a then world record 307 Test wickets with a best analysis of eight for 31. His tally of 1,745 wickets for Yorkshire is bettered only by Wilfred Rhodes, George Hirst, Schofield Haigh and George Macaulay. He achieved 100 wickets in a season on 12 occasions, with a best return of 175 wickets in 1960. He holds the record for most consecutive first-class matches played (67) in which he took a wicket. Trueman played in only 18 limited overs matches and took 28 wickets.\n In his own words, Fred Trueman \"didn't play cricket for social reasons like some of the fancy amateurs\". It was his living and he \"played to win\".[104] Conversely, he would try and do something each day to make the crowd laugh and \"he breathed life and humour into any cricket match\".[21] He took his bowling very seriously indeed but he liked to entertain when he was batting or fielding. On the occasions when he captained his team, especially in 1968 when Brian Close was injured for a long time, he proved to be \"a shrewd and intelligent exponent of the craft (of captaincy)\".[21]\n According to David Frith, it was his \"sense of fun and mischief\" that prompted Trueman to make a habit of visiting the opposition dressing room and this was always \"more than a social call\". Sometimes he did genuinely want to see a \"good mate\" in the other team, such as Tony Lock or Brian Statham, but more often than not it was \"a declaration of war, an acutely personal challenge, clothed in rollicking humour and self-caricature\".[105]\n Trueman always maintained his hostility towards the perceived arrogance and \"snobbishness\" of some in the cricketing establishment, especially the likes of Allen (or \"Sir\", as he wished to be called).[106] Trueman hated what he called \"fancy caps\" or \"jazz 'ats\", which specifically meant those of MCC and the universities, and was alleged to say on seeing the wearer of such a cap that he would \"pin him to t'bloody sightscreen\".[107][108] On one occasion, a Cambridge University batsman, having just been dismissed, acknowledged him with the condescending compliment: \"That was a very good ball, Mr Trueman\". Trueman replied: \"Aye, wasted on thee\".[74] In a similar vein, his view of the Gentlemen v Players fixture was that it was a \"ludicrous business\" that was \"thankfully abolished\" after the 1962 season.[109]\n John Warr, with whom Trueman shared his first-class debut, wrote that from the beginning of his career, Trueman's run-up was \"curving and long but nicely modulated\".[20] David Frith continued with Trueman reaching the wicket, where he turned his body side-on and cocked back his ball-carrying right arm, as the leading left arm was hoisted, before \"an awesome cartwheel\" sent him into a followthrough which \"resembled a Sea Fury finishing its mission along the runway of an aircraft carrier\".[110] Warr said Trueman's final stride had a \"pronounced drag\" which caused him some difficulties when the front-foot rule was introduced. His bowling arm was kept high through the delivery stride, to generate extra bounce and pace off the pitch, and the movement of the ball was \"predominantly away from the bat\" (i.e., the out-swinger).[20] Trueman himself maintained that his ability to bowl outswingers consistently was \"another new ingredient I brought to the county game\".[104] As Maurice Leyland said to him: \"Keep bowling those outswingers, Fred, and you'll be all right. That's the one that gets the great batsmen out!\"[104] Trueman acknowledged that other great fast bowlers who could bowl the outswinger well were Ray Lindwall and Wes Hall; but Brian Statham and Frank Tyson could not.[109]\n In Jim Kilburn's view, \"(Trueman's) place among the truly great bowlers of cricket history is beyond question\".[98] He had a \"resilience of spirit (that was) as marked as the physical power that gave him such remarkable freedom from injury over the years\".[111] His name on the team-sheet was \"an advertisement for any match\".[112] Trueman's method was a long, accelerating run-up ending in a wide delivery stride with a \"cartwheel\" swing of the arms and a balanced follow-through.[98] Technically, he was \"highly accomplished\" as he had much more than mere speed at his command, for he learned in-swing, out-swing and variation of pace and length.[112] Kilburn's final analysis of Trueman's contribution to Yorkshire cricket is: \"In an XI representing all the county history he would be selected\".[111]\n In his early days, Trueman had very fast pace but tended to be wayward and was liable to be punished accordingly.[21] His natural hostility in that period earned him his famous nickname of \"Fiery Fred\".[20] As time went by, much of the belligerence and raw pace faded being replaced by a growing mastery of the bowling arts.[21] Strength, determination and stamina were always among Trueman's greatest attributes and with maturity came a control of both seam and swing.[21] In Warr's view, Trueman learned that it was unwise to always follow a boundary with a bouncer and instead he cultivated the yorker as \"a potent weapon\".[20] Trueman was one of the most charismatic cricketers of the post-war period and this charisma has been summarised by Mick Pope and Paul Dyson in \"the rolling up of the flapping shirt sleeve on the walk back to his mark; the tossing back of the wayward locks of black hair before the smooth accelerated run to the wicket culminating with a high cartwheel action and drag of the back foot through the crease\", the conclusion being that \"Trueman is one of English cricket's icons\".[21]\n Trueman's career lasted twenty seasons, an extremely long span for a fast bowler, and Arlott noted of him that he maintained his form and ability \"much longer than the peak period (i.e., a decade) of even the best of the kind (and) he was, when the fire burned, as fine a fast bowler as any\".[21] When explaining his success as a fast bowler, Trueman always maintained that he was \"blessed by two things from birth\": the \"Trueman tenacity\" and the \"perfect physique for a fast bowler\". He said that the essentials for that perfect physique were having strong, thick legs \u2013 \"always the first essentials\" \u2013 with big shoulders and hips.[113]\n Wisden described Fred Trueman as \"probably the greatest fast bowler England has produced\".[35] Trueman would have considered this to be an understatement as he believed himself to be \"t'finest fast bowler that ever drew breath\" and there were many who agreed with him.[107]\n Although he always saw himself as a specialist bowler, Trueman was an outstanding fielder and a useful late order batsman. He preferred to field close in, his favourite position being leg slip, and he was a fine and safe catcher.[21] Warr says Trueman was a \"brilliant ambidextrous thrower\" and he \"made life very easy for his captain to place him advantageously in the field\".[20] Though he had some talent as a batsman, Trueman never aspired to becoming a genuine all-rounder. He lacked the necessary consistency as he batted primarily to entertain but he had a good defensive technique with a range of attacking strokes which he would employ boldly.[21] His batting consistency did improve in later years and he scored three first-class centuries.\n Trueman was an expert summariser for the BBC's Test Match Special radio cricket commentaries from 1974 to 1999, forming close friendships with commentators John Arlott and Brian Johnston. He was well known for his direct style of commentary and frequently used a catch phrase, \"I don't know what's going off out there\", to express his dismay that current England players lacked his knowledge of tactics.[114] Trueman was noted for his dislike of many aspects of the modern game, especially one-day cricket and the frequency with which current fast bowlers sustained injury. He was criticised by some for being unduly negative about current players and for glorifying cricket \"in my day\".[114] He once remarked, amusingly without any sense of irony: \"We didn't have metaphors in my day. We didn't beat about the bush\".[115]\n Trueman was nevertheless respected for his unsurpassed knowledge of the mechanics of fast bowling, and many feel he should have been used as a bowling coach for England's under-achieving teams of the 1980s and 1990s, a point once emphasised by his fellow-summariser Trevor Bailey on Test Match Special.[116] A good example of Trueman's coaching ability had occurred in 1975 when he was approached by the Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee for help. Lillee was having trouble with both his run-up and bowling action, problems that Trueman had already observed and mentioned on the radio. Trueman gave Lillee the technical advice that provided the solution and Lillee was soon able to recover his form, though this was at the expense of England. Trueman received criticism from many people in the England camp for helping an Australian player, especially after Lillee publicly acknowledged his debt to Trueman. Bailey, on the other hand, completely rejected this criticism and said that the \"prima donnas\" of English cricket should also have the sense to consult experts like Trueman.[116]\n In the 1970s Trueman presented the Yorkshire Television ITV programme Indoor League, which was broadcast at 5.15\u00a0pm on a Thursday evening, after the children's programmes.[117] This show had a notably Northern, working class focus, and featured pub games such as darts, bar billiards, shove ha'penny, skittles and arm-wrestling. Trueman anchored the programme with a pint of bitter and his pipe to hand, and signed off each week with his catchphrase, \"Ah'll sithee\" (Yorkshire dialect for \"I'll be seeing you\").[118]\n He made guest appearances in a number of popular British television programmes of the 1970s, most notably in the Dad's Army episode The Test (series 4, episode 10), which centred on a cricket match. Trueman's character bowled one ball and then retired with a shoulder injury.[119] He was the subject of This Is Your Life on 5 December 1979.[120] He wrote a column in the Sunday People newspaper for 43 years to provide coverage of cricket and rugby league.[121] Soon after his retirement from cricket, he tried his hand at being a stand-up comedian but found after-dinner speaking to be a more congenial and lucrative occupation.[122]\n Fred Trueman married Enid Chapman on 19 March 1955 at All Saints Church, Scarborough, and had three children: Karen, Rebecca and Rodney.[36][74] After divorce in 1972, Trueman remarried on 28 February 1973 at the register office in Skipton. His second wife was Veronica Wilson who had two children: Sheenagh and Patrick. They lived in the Craven village of Flasby in the Yorkshire Dales.[123] Trueman was the titular proprietor of a company called Freddie Trueman Sports Ltd which operated a sporting goods shop in Skipton until it was dissolved.[124] In June 1990, his daughter Rebecca married Damon Welch, the son of film actress Raquel Welch, but the marriage ended in divorce two years later.[125][126]\n Trueman was made an OBE in 1989.[36][74] After his Test Match Special colleague Brian Johnston had nicknamed him \"Sir Frederick\", there were those who thought he had really been knighted and many, particularly in his native county, who could not understand why he had not.[127]\n Having been a pipe-smoker all of his adult life, Trueman was elected Pipe Smoker of the Year in 1974 by the British Pipesmokers' Council. This award was discontinued in 2004, two years before Trueman was diagnosed with lung cancer, because its organisers feared it fell foul of new laws on tobacco promotion.[128] Trueman was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma of the lung in May 2006.[129] He died of the disease on 1 July 2006 at Airedale General Hospital in Steeton with Eastburn, West Yorkshire.[130][131] His body is interred in the cemetery at Bolton Abbey.[132]\n On 18 March 2010, a bronze statue of Trueman by Yorkshire-born sculptor Graham Ibbeson was unveiled by Veronica Trueman at the Leeds and Liverpool Canal basin in Skipton. Also in attendance were Trueman's brother Dennis and the former Test umpire Dickie Bird.[133]\n", " The 2016 Duck Commander 500 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held on April 9, 2016, at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas. Contested over 334 laps on the 1.5-mile (2.4\u00a0km) intermediate quad-oval, it was the seventh race of the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season, The race had 17 lead changes among different drivers and 7 cautions for 41 laps.\n Texas Motor Speedway is a speedway located in the northernmost portion of the U.S. city of Fort Worth, Texas\u00a0\u2013 the portion located in Denton County, Texas. The track measures 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) around and is banked 24\u00a0degrees in the turns, and is of the oval design, where the front straightaway juts outward slightly. The track layout is similar to Atlanta Motor Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway (formerly Lowe's Motor Speedway). The track is owned by Speedway Motorsports, Inc., the same company that owns Atlanta and Charlotte Motor Speedways, as well as the short-track Bristol Motor Speedway.\n The entry list for the Duck Commander 500 was released on Monday, April 4 at 10:12\u00a0a.m. Eastern time. Forty cars were entered for the race.\n Martin Truex Jr. was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 27.995 and a speed of 192.892\u00a0mph (310.430\u00a0km/h).[10]\n Carl Edwards scored the pole for the race with a time of 27.748 and a speed of 194.609\u00a0mph (313.193\u00a0km/h).[11] He said after the session that he sure does \"like it here, I really enjoy Texas. I have a lot of friends here. This is a fun place to race. The tire, I don\u2019t know what the other guys feel, the tire and downforce package for me lets me feel like I can go into the corner and move around and feel the tire underneath me. Even in qualifying, there were times when I got a little sideways and it slid a little bit and I could recover and that\u2019s really fun as a race car driver. Hopefully the race goes well. We have some practice later. I just cannot thank my guys on this Stanley Tools Camry enough, they are unbelievable.\u201d[12] After qualifying second, Joey Logano said that he was \"really good in (Turns) 1 and 2. That's where we beating the 19. And then I went in there the last time, and it didn't turn like it was, and I was like, \"Oh, no, that's our good area\u2026\u2019 We actually fixed 3 and 4, and we were pretty good down there. But we kind of flip-flopped, and we needed both\u2026 Just (with) another run on the tires, it's so hard to go faster at this track.\"[13]\n Martin Truex Jr. was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 28.068 and a speed of 192.390\u00a0mph (309.622\u00a0km/h).[15]\n Because of rain during the day, the race started under a green/yellow condition (the race started under caution, but the laps began counting) at 9:35\u00a0p.m. The race began under the first caution of the night. Carl Edwards led the field to the green flag on lap 6. Martin Truex Jr., who was running second after six laps, fell back to third after his grille was covered by a piece of debris. He tried to pull up to the rear of Joey Logano, but the debris remained. He then fell behind Denny Hamlin and managed to get the debris off. The second caution of the race flew on lap 29. This was a scheduled competition caution due to rain. On pit road, Jimmie Johnson slammed into the rear of Kyle Busch and partly caved in the nose of his car. David Ragan opted not to pit and assumed the race lead. He would eventually pit and hand the lead back to Edwards.\n The race restarted on lap 34. Truex passed Edwards exiting turn 4 to take the lead on lap 60. A number of cars began pitting under green on lap 73. Truex gave up the lead to pit on lap 74 and handed the lead to Matt Kenseth. He pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Chase Elliott, who was also making his pit stop. The lead cycled back to Truex.\n Truex continued to pull away from the field as he pulled to a five-second lead by lap 100. A number of cars began pitting under green on lap 111. Truex ducked onto pit road on lap 112 and handed the lead to Busch. Brian Vickers spun out trying to enter pit road. He continued on and the race remained green. Unfortunately, he and Josh Wise were tagged for a commitment line violation and were forced to serve a pass-through penalty. Busch pitted the next lap and the lead cycled back to Truex.\n Paul Menard was black-flagged for the corner panel being pulled out and was forced to pit to fix it on lap 128.[16] Brad Keselowski made an unscheduled stop the next lap for a loose wheel. Debris in turn 4 brought out the third caution of the race on lap 134. Edwards exited pit road with the race lead.\n The race restarted on lap 142. Truex ducked onto pit road on lap 177 and handed the lead to Busch. He pitted the next lap and handed the lead to Elliott. He pitted the next lap and the lead cycled back to Edwards.\n Truex drove under Edwards to retake the lead on lap 208. The fourth caution of the race flew on lap 210 for a single-car wreck in turn 4. Rounding turn 3, Wise suffered a right-front tire blowout and slammed the wall.[17] He would go on to finish 40th.[18] Kenseth opted not to pit under the caution and assumed the lead. Kevin Harvick was tagged for speeding and an uncontrolled tire and restarted the race from the tail-end of the field.\n The race restarted on lap 222. Edwards, who restarted second, made an unscheduled stop the next lap for a loose wheel.[19] He rejoined the race in 19th one lap down. Truex passed Kenseth going into turn 3 to retake the lead on lap 236. A number of cars began hitting pit road with 78 laps to go. Truex pitted with 76 laps to go and handed the lead to Trevor Bayne. He tried to extend his fuel run, but was chased down and passed by Truex for the lead.[20]\n Debris on the front stretch brought out the fifth caution of the race with 58 laps to go.\n The race restarted with 50 laps to go. The sixth caution of the race flew with 47 laps to go for a single-car wreck in turn 2. Rounding turn 1, Kasey Kahne tapped the left-rear corner of Greg Biffle, got him loose and sent him into the wall.\n The race restarted with 42 laps to go. The seventh caution of the race flew with 41 laps to go for a multi-car wreck on the backstretch.[17] Exiting turn 2, Johnson made contact with the rear-end of Austin Dillon and sent him sliding into the wall.[21] Dillon overcorrected and hit the outside wall with the right-front of his car.[21] His car turned down the track, was clipped by Ricky Stenhouse Jr., slid down and tapped the inside wall.[21] With a number of cars trying to avoid the spinning No. 3 car, an accordion-effect led to more cars being caught up in the melee.[21] A total of 13 cars sustained damage in the wreck.[22] Dillon said afterwards that being on older tires, he \"was trying to get all I could there. It\u2019s part of trying to win a race. We put ourselves in a position to be out front, thinking that two laps wouldn\u2019t mean much, but it did. That\u2019s part of it. The good Lord kept me safe tonight and gave me a good race car. You have to be gracious in defeat. We\u2019ll come back next week with another fast car and hopefully we can do the same thing we did today, and that\u2019s run up front.\"[23]\n The race restarted with 33 laps to go. Busch drove by him on the backstretch to take the lead with 32 laps to go and drove on to score the victory.[24]\n Busch said after the race that life is \"pretty darn good, I\u2019ll tell you that. I\u2019ve got a great wife, a great son and I\u2019m having a blast, living the dream with Adam Stevens (crew chief) and these guys, and Joe (Gibbs, JGR owner) and JD (Gibbs, JGR co-chairman), thinking about you guys back at home and of course Coy (Gibbs, JGR COO) is here with us. Everybody back at the shop has been building great race cars, they\u2019ve been doing a great job for us. The crew chiefs here have been really working together, gelling together and putting everything together. It\u2019s just fun, right now it\u2019s all clicking and going together.\u201d[25]\n After a runner-up finish, Dale Earnhardt Jr. said that \"we need a win. We'd love to get a win. I know our fans want a win real bad. Trust me, man, we're all working real hard. We're running great every week. So at least that's hopefully fun to watch for you guys. I had a blast inside the car, lot of sliding around, sideways -- good, hard racing. We'll go to the next one, I guess, and try again.\"[26]\n After finishing third, Logano said he was \"proud of what my race team did. This Shell/Pennzoil team executed perfectly today. We may not have had the fastest car, we obviously didn\u2019t have the fastest car, but we executed into a top-three finish, and I\u2019m very proud of my team for that. We had great pit stops and great calls, so everything worked out well. Everyone did their job. That\u2019s kind of been our weak point this year is that we haven\u2019t had the speed, but we haven\u2019t been executing perfectly. Now it seemed like we executed right and we\u2019ve got to work on our speed now.\u201d[27]\n Not satisfied with a career best fifth-place finish, Elliott said that running in \"fifth isn't a contender. You've got to be running higher. We'll keep working on it.\"[28]\n After leading 142 of the 334 laps, Truex described finishing sixth as \"frustrating.\"[29] He also added that the way it turned out \"hurts a little bit and move on and we'll take the positives out of tonight.\"[30]\n Fox Sports covered their 16th race at the Texas Motor Speedway. Mike Joy, 2009 race winner Jeff Gordon and Darrell Waltrip had the call in the booth for the race. Jamie Little, Vince Welch and Matt Yocum handled the pit road duties for the television side.\n The race was broadcast on radio by the Performance Racing Network and simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Doug Rice, Mark Garrow and Wendy Venturini called the race from the booth when the field raced down the front stretch. Rob Albright called the race from atop a billboard outside of turn 2 when the field raced through turns 1 and 2. Pat Patterson called the race from a billboard outside of turn 3 when the field raced through turns 3 and 4. On pit road, PRN was manned by Brad Gillie, Brett McMillan, Jim Noble and Steve Richards.\n \n \n \n", " Shengavit Medical Center (Armenian: \u0547\u0565\u0576\u0563\u0561\u057e\u056b\u0569 \u0562\u056a\u0577\u056f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u056f\u0565\u0576\u057f\u0580\u0578\u0576), is one of the leading private multi-disciplinary therapeutic and diagnostic facilities in Yerevan (Armenia), base of the clinical postgraduate training for Yerevan State Medical University and the National Institute of Health.

Specifically, the above-mentioned speculative conception of submarine warfare, based on ramming and making no mention of torpedoes, is shared with Verne (see \"Facing the Flag\", \"HMS Sword\").\n Later, Kaitei gunkan became the first in a wildly successful, six-volume series set in the Pacific and Indian Oceans: Buky\u014d no Nippon (\u6b66\u4fa0\u306e\u65e5\u672c lit. Heroic Japan, 1902), Shinz\u014d Gunkan (\u65b0\u9020\u8ecd\u8266 lit. The Newly Built Battleship, 1904), Buky\u014d Kantai (\u6b66\u4fa0\u8266\u968a lit. Heroic Armada, 1904), Shin Nippont\u014d (\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u5cf6 lit. New Japan Isle, 1906), and T\u014dy\u014d Buky\u014d Dan (\u6771\u6d0b\u6b66\u4fa0\u56e3 lit. East Asian Heroic Troupe, 1907). The books remained in print for many years and later got much additional attention through a successful film adaptation.\n Oshikawa was enthusiastic about sports, especially baseball, and famously clashed with Inaz\u014d Nitobe \u2014 one of the main proponents of the baseball considered harmful (\u91ce\u7403\u5bb3\u6bd2\u8ad6) argument.\n He has also contributed to the development of the Japanese detective fiction. Some of his stories incorporated elements of ratiocination, sleuthing, mystery and crime within stories of adventure, intrigue, the bizarre and the grotesque - though in his time this did not yet become a distinct genre on its own.\n In the detailed list compiled by \"The Victorian Bookshelf\" project of \"Confluence 2000,\" tracing the early development of \"The Scientific Romance and other Related Works\",[2] Oshikawa Shunr\u014d is the only non-Western author mentioned for the pre-1900 period. \n However, all the above is inextricably mixed with Oshikawa's share in and responsibility for helping to perpetuate in Japanese popular culture - especially through works greatly influencing children and youths which remained in print for many decades after his own time - themes of Japanese nationalism and patriotism, some which can be considered to promote militarism and imperialism as well.\n As noted by Jeffrey M. Angles in his 2003 Ohio State University dissertation on Japanese popular authors in the early Twentieth Century,[3] Shunro is best remembered in Japan for his important role in developing adventure tales into an independent genre of children's fiction. \n Oshikawa entered the publishing company Hakubunkan at the introduction of the author Iwaya Sazanami (1870\u20131933) and served as a lead reporter for Shaijitsu Gah\u014d (\u5199\u5b9f\u753b\u5831 lit. Graphic Pictorial), a magazine that featured stories and photos about the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. This magazine ceased publication in 1907, but Oshikawa became co-editor of another Hakubunkan magazine, B\u014dken sekai (\u5192\u967a\u4e16\u754c lit. World of Adventure).\n During and following the war with Russia there was a strong patriotic wave in Japan, and - though their country had won a decisive victory over the Russians and capitalized upon it to annex Korea - some Japanese were left feeling dissatisfied with the war's achievements. An earlier magazine - Tanken Sekai (\u63a2\u691c\u4e16\u754c lit. World of Exploration), published by Hakubunkan's competitor Seik\u014dzasshisha (\u6210\u529f\u96d1\u8a8c\u793e) - catered to those wishing to read tales of Japanese adventure and exploration abroad and fantasies of imperialistic superiority and Japanese valor, in which  fiction was mixed with more or less factual accounts of exploration, record-breaking achievements and \"unusual customs\" from around the world.\n Hakubunkan's  \"B\u014dken sekai\" (\u5192\u967a\u4e16\u754c), which Oshikawa co-edited, was - as clearly shown by researcher Kawataro Nakajima - designed to appeal to the same kind of public, which had shown itself attracted to tales of military adventure and heroism. \"B\u014dken Sekai\" often contained allegedly true stories of adventure, exploration, military prowess and accounts of \"primitive\" lands, all of which reflected Japanese nationalism and imperial ambitions. At the same time, however, it also published mysteries, including translations of Western Detective Stories, as well as ghost stories. Virtually every issue of the magazine included a story or article by Oshikawa himself.\n After a dispute with his publisher, Oshikawa left Hakubunkan. In October 1911 he founded the magazine \"Buyk\u014d Sekai\" (\u6b66\u4fa0\u4e16\u754c lit. World of Heroism) with the capital of an entrepreneur named Yanaginuma Kensuke, whose publishing house (Buky\u014d Sekaisha, later Buky\u014dsha) concentrated at the time on books of adventure, sports and physical activity for young people. Oshikawa's new monthly magazine, which he edited until his death, strongly resembled his earlier one, and it too carried tales of exploration, non-fictional adventure stories, editorials, sports-related tales, and translations of mysteries. \n On August 6, 1914, Oshikawa was accompanied by several of the magazine's editors, contributors, illustrators and fans on an outing to a lakeshore in the northern part of the Kant\u014d region. Possibly because of his death shortly afterwards, that outing seemed to be long remembered by and influence the later work of participants such as the artist Kosugi Misei who had illustrated many of Oshikawa's stories and followed him from his earlier magazine to the later one. \n Oshikawa's works were never translated in any significant way to Western languages, leaving his literary influence limited mainly to Japan itself. However, the many loose film adaptations of his books, starting in the 1960s, did gain a considerable audience in America and Europe, such as Kaitei Gunkan (1963, released in the US as Atragon) - an adaptation which came to be considered \"a Classic of Science Fiction Films\" - and Shin Kaitei Gunkan (1996 and 1998, released in the US as Super Atragon). \n The film versions were considerably different from the original, both due to the addition of Science Fiction and Fantasy elements such as a kaiju and because the handling of Oshikawa's nationalist themes was naturally influenced by Japan's profound grappling with this issue in the aftermath of the Second World War.\n The \"Buyk\u014d Sekai\" magazine survived its founder and continued publication after Oshikawa's death, until 1923.\n The book Kaidanji: Oshikawa Shunr\u014d (\u5feb\u7537\u5150\u30fb\u62bc\u5ddd\u6625\u6d6a)(\"Devil of a fellow:Oshikawa Shunrou\"), by Yokota Jun'ya and Aizu Shingo, won the Nihon SF Taisho (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan) Award for 1988.[4]\n", " The 2017 World Men's Curling Championship (branded as Ford World Men's Curling Championship 2017 for sponsorship reasons) was a curling event that was held from April 1 to 9 at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Alberta.\n Canada won the title for the 36th time overall and the second consecutive year.

The album was issued in 1976 by Maranatha! Music and was produced by Al Perkins. It is typical of the country rock sound the band performed in the mid-1970s before their switch to alternative rock in the early 1980s.\n Heavily influenced by the Band, Steely Dan and the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo, Daniel Amos' debut full-length album temporarily leaves behind the rock roots of the band members earlier bands although many of the songs came from those days. Baxter's \"The Bible\" and \"Love in a Yielded Heart\" (then known as \"Freedom\") were both performed in the early days of Jubal's Last Band, the band that was formed in late 1972 and eventually evolved into Daniel Amos. Taylor's \"William\", \"Dusty Road,\" and \"Ain't Gonna Fight It\" date back to 1971 and his early band Good Shephard, and \"Skeptic's Song\" (then known as \"Resurrection\") dates back at least to 1972 and his band, Judge Rainbow and the Prophetic Trumpets.\n The band's recording contract with Maranatha! resulted from Jubal's Last Band's audition for the label sometime in mid-1975. Another band at the meeting, led by Darrell Mansfield, had a similar name - Jubal. The two bands decided to change their names to avoid confusion. Mansfield renamed his band Gentle Faith, and Jubal's Last Band became Daniel Amos. Not long after, D.A. recorded its first song for Maranatha!, Taylor's \"'Aint Gonna Fight It.\" That track was released on the Various Artists album, Maranatha! 5 towards the end of that same year. That December, D.A. entered Mama Jo's Studio and began work on their first album. The album was released in early 1976.\n In 2004, work began on a special 30th Anniversary Deluxe two-disc version of the album. The collection, released on June 26, 2006, includes the full newly remastered album, never before seen photos, bonus material, interviews and more. The second disc traced the band's evolution from various bands in the early 1970s to the formation of Daniel Amos in 1975. Also included for those who pre-ordered the collection was third disc of bonus material similar to the second.

Within the first 10 months, the bank granted 12.1 million in mortgage loans.[2] The bank\u2019s main objective was to lower the cost of home-ownership to the Belizean public, primarily to low and middle income earners.[3]\n Jose Marin, former president of Provident Bank Belize, was hired as the first managing director; however, on March 21, 2014, with less than a year at the job, he was asked by the Board of Directors to resign with immediate effect.[4] On March 24, 2014, with only three days after Jose Marin\u2019s departure, Janet Arnold was named as the Deputy General Manager.[5] With its main objective in mind and with just over two years in operation, on September 3, 2015, National Bank of Belize Ltd. opened its second branch in the old capital, Belize City. At the inauguration, General Manager, Alvaro Alamina, stated that it was imperative for the National Bank to establish a presence in what continues to be the country\u2019s commercial hub.[6]\n With three years in operation, National Bank of Belize Ltd. has suffered significant losses.[7]\n", " \"Bring a Torch, Jeanette, Isabella\" (French: Un flambeau, Jeannette, Isabelle) is a Christmas carol which originated from the Provence region of France in the 17th century.  The song is usually notated in 3/8 time.\n The carol was first published in France, and was subsequently translated into English in the 18th century. The song was originally not meant to be sung at Christmas; it was considered dance music for French nobility.\n It seems likely that the melody was written by Charpentier, derived from the air \u00e0 boire Qu'ils sont doux, bouteille jolie from the now lost Le m\u00e9decin malgr\u00e9 lui.[1]\n The song title refers to two female farmhands who have found the baby and his mother in a stable.

The film documents the history of Walt Disney Feature Animation from 1984 to 1994, covering the rise of a period referred to as the Disney Renaissance.\n The film uses no new on-camera interviews, instead relying primarily on archival interviews, press kit footage, in-progress and completed footage from the films being covered, and personal film/videos shot (often against company policy) by the employees of the animation studio.\n Waking Sleeping Beauty debuted at the 2009 Telluride Film Festival,[1] and played at film festivals across the country before its limited theatrical release on March 26, 2010 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.[2]\n The documentary is narrated by animator and film producer Don Hahn, with numerous audio interviews from company animators and executives.\n The documentary begins in the early 1980s, when The Walt Disney Company was led by Walt Disney's son-in-law Ron W. Miller.  Many new animators had joined the company after graduating from CalArts, but were hired in a time where animation was considered a dying art.  Roy E. Disney, Walt's nephew and son of Disney co-founder Roy O. Disney, resigned from the company during a corporate takeover by Saul Steinberg, leading to Miller's ousting. Roy returned to the studio as vice-chairman of the board of directors, and chairman of the animation department. Roy employed Michael Eisner and Frank Wells as the new CEO and President respectively.\n Eisner hired Jeffrey Katzenberg as head of the film division, but he proved to be a controversial figure, moving the animation department to an off-site building in Glendale, California. Roy hired Peter Schneider to be President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, who helped modernize the animation process. Losing in the box office to animated films released by Don Bluth, a former studio animator who left in 1979 to found his own company, Disney began producing animated films to release one a year, and began releasing classic films on the new home video format. A gong show in the company led to the green-lighting of numerous film projects.  The production of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, though expensive for Disney, proved to be a huge financial success, along with Oliver & Company.\n The Disney Renaissance, which lasted from 1989 to 1999, began with The Little Mermaid. The soundtrack was composed and written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who also composed Beauty and the Beast; Menken later composed Aladdin.  Ashman's involvement in The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast aided in both being box office successes and winning Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score. However, Ashman died from AIDS in March 1991 before Beauty and the Beast was released; the film was dedicated to his memory. The Rescuers Down Under  utilized the new CAPS system, which blended traditional and computer animation together, but the film was a box office disappointment.\n Following the success of Beauty and the Beast, Eisner and Roy announced to the animators that they would receive a new animation building as a reward for their hard work, but Katzenberg was unaware of this.  In 1994, The Lion King was released and was another box office success for Disney. On April 4, 1994, Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash.  Following Wells' death, Katzenberg expected to become the new company President, but was denied the position by Eisner, eventually leading to his resignation; he later would go on to co-found future animation rival DreamWorks.\n Narration is done by Hahn, with new audio-only interviews done by several of the studio's principal figures, including former executives Eisner, Katzenberg, and Roy E. Disney, and animator/directors Mike Gabriel, Rob Minkoff, Roger Allers, Gary Trousdale, and Kirk Wise. The footage includes filmmakers Tim Burton, John Lasseter, Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, Richard Williams, and George Scribner, as well as Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, Jodi Benson, Robin Williams, Paige O'Hara, Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Elton John, and Tim Rice. A significant portion of the personal film used was shot by John Lasseter and Joe Ranft for Disney animator Randy Cartwright, who is featured giving makeshift \"studio tours\" in 1980, 1984, and 1990. The Cartwright footage which is used to bookend the film.[3]\n The film is dedicated to the memory of Howard Ashman, former Disney President and chief operating officer Frank Wells, animator Joe Ranft, and Roy E. Disney.\n Since its 2009 release, Waking Sleeping Beauty has received generally positive reviews from most critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes currently gives the film a \"certified fresh\" rating of 70% based on 50 reviews. The general consensus is, \"[The film] doesn't probe as deep \u2013 or tell as many hard truths \u2013 as it could have, but Don Hahn's look at Disney's rebirth offers a fascinating and surprisingly candorous glimpse into the studio's past.\"[4] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 70 based on 18 critics.[5] It earned a Special Achievement Award at the 2010 Annie Awards and a Best Documentary Feature nomination at the 2010 St. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association Awards.\n", " Andreas Pevernage or Andries Pevernage (1542 or 1543 \u2013 30 July 1591) was a Flemish composer of the late Renaissance and a choirmaster in Bruges, Kortrijk, and Antwerp.  He was one of a few composers from the Low Countries who remained in his native land throughout the turbulent period of religious conflict in the late 16th century. He was a skilled composer of chansons, motets and madrigals.[2]\n Pevernage was born in Harelbeke, a small town near to Kortrijk, and probably spent his boyhood years as a singer in the church in Kortrijk.  He became the choirmaster at the church of St Salvator in Brugge (Bruges in French) on 21 January 1563, and later that same year became choirmaster at the Onze Lieve Vrouwkerk (Notre Dame) in Kortrijk.  In 1564 he became chaplain there, and rose to the position of permanent vicar in 1569.  Also in Kortrijk, he joined the guild of St. Cecilia, for which he wrote some of his music.\n The religious wars of the 16th century ravaged the Netherlands as they had adjacent regions, and war came to Kortrijk.  He fled the city in 1577 or 1578 with his family when the Calvinists took over; they had little use for music, and as a Roman Catholic he was unsafe during this period of persecution; his family went to Antwerp, where they stayed until the next year, during which Pevernage was appointed to the post of choirmaster in Bruges.  However, Calvinists captured this town as well, and Pevernage was out of a job until 1584, at which time he regained his former employment in Kortrijk.  On 29 October 1585 he was appointed choirmaster at the cathedral in Antwerp; this was shortly after the Spanish capture of the town (see Siege of Antwerp (1584-1585); the Protestant rebels had been forcibly ejected from the city in August).  One of Pevernage's activities there was to rebuild the extensive music library, which had been ransacked and burned by Calvinists.  He remained at this post until his death in 1591, and was buried in the cathedral.\n Pevernage was a fairly prolific composer of both sacred and secular vocal music; of his output, about 235 pieces (115 sacred, 120 secular) remain.  No specifically instrumental music has survived.\n His output of sacred includes six masses, published in Antwerp after his death (1602), for from five to seven voices; a collection of motets entitled Cantiones sacrae (1578), which also includes some secular works, many of which are occasional pieces written in honor of local nobility, including Margaret of Parma; and a group of 14 Marian antiphons, like the masses published posthumously.  Stylistically they are typical of late-16th-century practice, alternating homophonic and polyphonic textures, and using groups of voices in alternation in a cori spezzati style; the influence of the Venetian school was felt even as far away as the Netherlands.\n Pevernage also wrote Italian madrigals, in Italian; it was a wildly popular form even in northern Europe (the vogue in England was just beginning in the late 1580s), and also wrote many French chansons, published in four separate books.  They make use of syncopation, melismas, and complex rhythms.\n \n", " Come Swing with Me! is an album by American singer Frank Sinatra, released in 1961.\n The album is Sinatra's final swing session with Capitol Records, as his next album, Point of No Return, would be composed mainly of torch songs. This album is possibly unique for the orchestral arrangement and stereophonic set-up by Billy May. Due to Capitol's signature \"full-spectrum Stereo sound,\" the audience can distinctly hear the placement of specific orchestral pieces in the studio at the time of the recording, i.e. differences in brass sections from left, to right, to all together in the center.  This is most apparent to the apt listener in the album's opening hit, \"Day by Day\".\n", " \n The Tiger Rail Trail or Birregurra-Forrest Rail Trail is a rail trail following the route of the former Forrest branch railway line.\n \n", " Sophian Rafai (born December 16, 1986) is a Moroccan-French basketball player currently playing for Juvisy in the French Basketball League.[1]\n Rafai is a member of the Morocco national basketball team and competed for the team at the FIBA Africa Championship 2009.[2]  After not playing in the team's first six games, Rafai got his first action at the tournament in the consolation bracket against Egypt.

", " Girl Meets World is an American comedy television series created by Michael Jacobs and April Kelly that aired on Disney Channel from June 27, 2014 to January 20, 2017. The series is a spinoff of Boy Meets World and stars Rowan Blanchard, Ben Savage, Sabrina Carpenter, Peyton Meyer, August Maturo, Danielle Fishel, and Corey Fogelmanis.\n The series centers around the life of Riley and her friends and family, particularly their school life, in which her father Cory Matthews is their history teacher. Riley shares a strong relationship with her best friend Maya Hart, who assists her in learning to cope with the social and personal issues of adolescence. Several Boy Meets World cast members reprise their roles in the series.\n Riley Matthews (Rowan Blanchard)[1] is the daughter of Cory and Topanga Matthews, and has a younger brother named Auggie. \n At the start of the series, Riley is 12 years old and in seventh grade.  She and her best friend, Maya Hart, explore school and life together while making new friends along the way.  She and Maya are in middle school for the first two seasons and then high school for the third season.  Riley is usually very optimistic and cheerful about life, and generally has faith in almost everyone.  She also has a very silly and quirky personality, much like her father and to an extent, her mother.  She is often portrayed as being very ditzy and innocent of the world around her.\n In the pilot episode, Riley develops a crush on Lucas Friar, whom she met on the subway on the way to school; he later becomes her classmate in Cory's history class. They go out on a date for the first time in \"Girl Meets First Date\". During season two, Riley and Maya discover that they both like Lucas and he also likes the two of them, but Riley is Lucas' choice in season three's two-part episode \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\". \n She is periodically portrayed by Lindsey Lamer in flashbacks to Riley and Maya's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by Mariah Buzolin.\n Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) is Riley and Auggie's father and Topanga's husband. He has taken a job as a history teacher at John Quincy Adams Middle School for the first two seasons and then Abigail Adams High School in the third season. In both settings, his class consists of his daughter and her friends, and his history lessons relate to their lives, becoming life lessons for them. In addition to being Riley's father, he often acts as a father figure to Maya. He also acts as a mentor to his students, much like Mr. Feeny was to Cory, Topanga, and Shawn in Boy Meets World.\n Maya Hart (Sabrina Carpenter) is Riley's best friend.  Maya was raised in a single-parent household by her mother Katy; she is tomboyish, social and street smart, but has a troubled past rooted in the fact that her father Kermit abandoned her and Katy before Maya turned five.  Consequently, Maya is wild and rebellious as evidenced by her actions, such as protesting homework and almost lighting a class assignment on fire, but her friendship with Riley and the Matthews family keeps her grounded most of the time.  \n In the second season three-part episode \"Girl Meets Texas\", Maya is shown to have deeper feelings for Lucas than she normally lets on. Riley notices Maya's feelings and decides to step back from Lucas and let Maya start a relationship with him, which turns out to be awkward.  In season 3, Maya goes through an identity crisis stemming from the fact that she loves Riley so much that Maya was influenced by her, which turned out to be an underlying reason why she liked Lucas.  After Riley helped bring Maya back to her true self, she realized that she does not like Lucas the same way Riley does, and that she became like Riley to protect her and to find out if Lucas was right for her.  After this she put her full support behind Riley and Lucas as a couple.\n Beginning in the first season, Maya develops a crush on Cory's younger brother Joshua.  He downplays it as a schoolgirl crush until season 3 when, in the two-parter \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\", Maya tells him she genuinely likes him, and he finally admits he has feelings for her as well; he tells her that there is a chance for them and that he is willing to play the long game and see what happens.  In the third season, after her mother Katy marries Shawn Hunter, Shawn presents Maya with adoption papers, and Maya accepts, proclaiming herself as Maya Hunter.[2]\n Maya is periodically portrayed by Ivy George in flashbacks to Maya and Riley's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by Ruby Lewis.\n Lucas Friar (Peyton Meyer) is another member of the group and at first was both Riley and Maya's love interest until Maya decided Riley and Lucas were good for one another. \n Originally from Austin, Texas, Lucas has gentlemanly manners and common sense, and has shown to be the protector of the group as he is fearless and unstoppable when defending his friends.  Because of his Texas upbringing, Maya often addresses Lucas stereotypically calling him derisive but good-natured names like \"Huckleberry\", \"Ranger Rick\" and \"Bucky McBoingboing\"; in \"Girl Meets 1961\" Lucas finds out that he is from a family of cowboys and had a great grandfather who had a brief career as a musician. In \"Girl Meets the Secret of Life\", it is revealed that Lucas is a year older than his classmates, and his father was transferred to New York giving Lucas a fresh start.  He had been expelled from his former school in Austin. The reason for his expulsion involved sticking up for his friend Zay Babineaux after he got into trouble with some students.\n Auggie Matthews (August Maturo) is Riley's precocious young brother and Cory and Topanga's son. Auggie is very attached to his parents and sister, and wants to be like his father when he grows up. His neighbor, Ava Morgenstern, becomes Auggie's girlfriend,\n Topanga Matthews (Danielle Fishel) is Riley and Auggie's mother and Cory's wife. Topanga is Cory's high school girlfriend and they have been friends since they were babies. Topanga has become a successful lawyer and is a loving and protective mother as shown in \"Girl Meets Sneak Attack\". She later inherits Svorski's from the late Mrs. Svorski, later changing the bakery's name to Topanga's.\n Farkle Minkus (Corey Fogelmanis) is close friends with Riley and Maya, but is also infatuated with both of them. In \"Girl Meets Sneak Attack\", it is shown that he cares for the two and will do anything for them to be happy. He is smart, eccentric, and a big flirt. He is shown to be the teacher's pet in many episodes. He is the son of Cory and Topanga's former classmates, Stuart Minkus and Jennifer Bassett; of the two, Farkle bears great similarities to his father. \n Farkle cares a great deal about his education and always keeps his grades up in class. In the season two episode \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\", his IQ score is found to be exceptionally high, so his guidance counselor has him take a series of tests to find out whether or not he has Asperger's Syndrome, which he and his friends are relieved to find that he does not. In this same episode he begins a relationship with his former arch-nemesis, Isadora Smackle, who reveals she was diagnosed with Asperger's at age five.\n Evelyn Rand (Jack\u00e9e Harry) meets Riley and Maya on the subway in the pilot; they later call her Crazy Hat because of the obscure hats they see her wearing at the subway station. She is revealed to be a successful businesswoman.\n Ava Morgenstern (Ava Kolker) is Auggie's girlfriend.  Being slightly older, she manipulates Auggie into doing whatever she wants, remaining oblivious to how this affects him.  Ava's personality appears to be a product of her mom's way of raising her.  Early on, Topanga makes it clear that she does not like Ava, but in the season 2 episode \"Girl Meets STEM\", she takes Ava's side: Ava is furious when she and Auggie get exactly the same trophy after Ava singlehandedly defeats Auggie's soccer team 29-0.  In the season 3 premiere \"Girl Meets High School: Part One\", Ava comes to Cory, Topanga, and Auggie when her parents are splitting up.\n Isadora Smackle (Cecilia Balagot) is Farkle's arch-rival. In \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\", it is revealed that she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome when she was five years old. By the start of \"Girl Meets High School, Part 1\", she has joined the others at Abigail Adams High School, having become Farkle's girlfriend and becoming closer with Riley, Maya, Lucas and Zay.\n Katy Hart (Cheryl Texiera) is Maya's mom. For Career Day at school, Katy reveals to Maya's class that though she works as a waitress she aspires to be an actress. Katy frequently fails to show up to any event of importance to Maya, believing herself to be a hindrance to her daughter's future. Her relationship with Maya is strained at first,  reminiscent to that of Shawn and Chet Hunter from Boy Meets World, but they become much closer after Shawn reveals to Maya in \"Girl Meets Master Plan\" that Maya's father deserting her family was not Katy's fault; Katy maintained the story that she drove him away believing that a girl should think well of her father.  As the series progresses, Katy becomes a manager for Topanga's bakery. After meeting Shawn, she develops feelings for him. The two get engaged in \"Girl Meets Upstate\" and subsequently wed in \"Girl Meets I Do\".\n Gabriella Kossal (Aisha Kabia) is the art teacher at John Quincy Adams Middle School who is impressed with Maya's art.\n Dewey/Doy[a] (Cooper Friedman) is a friend of Auggie who pronounces his name \"Doy\" much to the annoyance of Topanga. He does not like his name and cries each time somebody corrects his pronunciation.\n Zay Babineaux (Amir Mitchell-Townes) is Lucas' old friend from Texas who later moves to New York and enrolls at John Quincy Adams Middle School, who gradually befriends Riley, Maya and Farkle as he gets to know them better.  He fancies himself a smooth talker, but his words and actions more often get him into trouble rather than out of it.  When Zay and Lucas were classmates at their old school in Texas, Lucas was usually the one who bailed him out. Eventually, one of these situations caused Lucas to be expelled from his old school.\n Charlie Gardner (Tanner Buchanan) is a student at John Quincy Adams Middle School who admires Riley. In \"Girl Meets Semi-Formal\", he asked Riley to the semi-formal, right before Lucas was going to.\n Sarah (Sarah Carpenter) is a classmate of Riley and Maya at both John Quincy Adams Middle School and Abigail Adams High School. She mostly serves as a background character in many episodes, but achieves prominence in \"Girl Meets Hollyworld\" as a screenplay writer for a movie her father, the director DW Preminger, is casting. The episode \"Girl Meets Commonism\" shows her on the honor board panel and reveals her last name to be Carpenter.\n The following characters from Boy Meets World make appearances in the series in the form of recurring roles, guest appearances, or cameo appearances. They are listed in order of appearance:\n George Feeny (William Daniels) is Cory's omnipresent mentor who is now in his late 80s. Feeny makes a cameo appearance in the pilot episode, his only appearance in the first season. Mr. Feeny was Cory, Shawn, and Topanga's teacher in junior high, their principal in high school, and their professor in college. Throughout these years, Feeny was the Matthews' next-door neighbor and a close friend to the Matthews family as well as Shawn Hunter. In \"Girl Meets Gravity\", Cory calls Feeny to check up on him after the death of Mrs. Svorski. In \"Girl Meets Pluto\", Cory, Shawn, and Topanga, along with Riley and Maya, return to Philadelphia to dig up a time capsule from Feeny's backyard where they are caught by Feeny. He asks Riley and Maya how Cory has been to them as he receives some positive answers. He returns in the season three episode \"Girl Meets I Do\" where he comes to New York to wed Shawn and Katy. He returned in the series finale.[3]\n Stuart Minkus (Lee Norris) is Cory, Shawn, and Topanga's former classmate, appearing as a main cast member in the first season of Boy Meets World, and as a guest star in an episode of the fifth season. Although Cory and Shawn often bullied Minkus, the boys also looked to him for advice on girls and life, and Stuart was good friends with Topanga, later becoming a fierce rival, which carries over to this series. Making his return in \"Girl Meets Maya's Mother\", it is revealed that he is Farkle's father. He appears at Career Day at school, whereupon he instantly renews his rivalry with both Cory and Topanga, and is proud to mention his position as the CEO of Minkus International. In \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\", it is revealed that Stuart is married to Jennifer Bassett, an ex-girlfriend of Shawn's. He returned in the series finale.[3]\n Harley Keiner (Danny McNulty) is Cory's good friend and former high school bully. In Boy Meets World, Harley was much older than the rest of the students due to being held back. He now works as the janitor[4] at John Quincy Adams Middle School, as seen in \"Girl Meets the Forgotten\". He mentions in \"Girl Meets Flaws\" that Cory helped him get the job. Reminiscent of the original series, Harley likes to address Cory by the nickname Johnny Baboon. Harley is regretful for his past behavior and looks to steer kids from going down the wrong path. However, it is mildly implied that Harley's aggressive side isn't entirely gone as he mentions that without music, he is prone to do things. He returned in the series finale.[3]\n Alan Matthews (William Russ) is Cory, Eric, Joshua, and Morgan's father, Topanga's father-in-law, and Riley and Auggie's grandfather. Alan has a close relationship with Cory and owns a wilderness store which he originally ran with his eldest son Eric in Boy Meets World. He appeared along with his wife Amy and younger son Joshua in \"Girl Meets Home for the Holidays\". He returned in the series finale.[3]\n Amy Matthews (Betsy Randle) is Cory, Eric, Joshua, and Morgan's mother, Topanga's mother-in-law, and Riley and Auggie's grandmother. Amy has a close relationship with her children, especially Morgan, who is her only daughter. She would often disagree with Cory and Topanga as a couple when they made important decisions even though she is fond of them. She appeared along with her husband Alan and younger son Joshua in \"Girl Meets Home for the Holidays\". She returned in the series finale.[3]\n Joshua Matthews (Uriah Shelton) is Cory, Eric, and Morgan's teenage brother, and Riley and Auggie's uncle. He was born premature, underweight, and almost died just hours after his birth. He first appears with his parents in \"Girl Meets Home for the Holidays\", where he is 17 years old and is still living with them in Philadelphia. Maya has a major crush on him, although Joshua tries to make their three-year age difference clear to her. He visits his brother's home throughout the series, and enrolled at New York University prior to the end of season one. In the season three, two-part episode \"Girl Meets Ski Lodge\", he helps Cory chaperone his class's field trip. During the trip, he tells Maya that there could be a possibility for them in the future. He also appeared in \"Girl Meets Bear\" before returning in the series finale.[3]\n Joshua was the only member of the immediate Matthews family never to have a prominent role in Boy Meets World; he was originally portrayed by creator Michael Jacobs's son Daniel in Boy Meets World.\n Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong) is Cory's best friend since childhood, Topanga's close childhood friend, and uncle figure to Riley and Auggie. Since the end of Boy Meets World, Shawn has traveled around as a writer and a photographer. He first appears in \"Girl Meets Home for the Holidays\" and later forms a friendship with Maya, and develops feelings for her mother Katy. Cory and Shawn have a close relationship with each other that, as shown in Boy Meets World, is at times even stronger than the relationship between Cory and Topanga.\n In the season three episode \"Girl Meets Upstate\", it is revealed that he has a cabin in Upstate New York. At the end of the episode, he gets engaged to Katy. In \"Girl Meets I Do\", Shawn gets married to Katy. In the series finale, Shawn presents Maya with adoption papers and Maya accepts.[3][2]\n Eric Matthews (Will Friedle) is Cory, Joshua, and Morgan's older brother, and Riley and Auggie's uncle. He first appears in \"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels\". Like in the original series, Eric is a goofball and lovable, but is quite dimwitted sometimes. Now a full-grown adult, he appears to have matured a little, but is still considered to be the fun uncle in the Matthews family. As evidenced in the original series, Eric has good people skills. Since leaving Philadelphia, Eric has gone on to become the Mayor of St. Upid Town, New York, a fictional community near the borders of New York State and the Canadian Province of Quebec, after all those who would have supported his mayoral opponent died in a landslide, according to Eric.\n To blend in with the locals, he wears a hermit costume, an homage to his faux alter ego, Plays with Squirrels, from the Boy Meets World episode \"Seven the Hard Way\". Running gags include calling Riley his \"niche\", referring to Auggie as his cousin, and frequently mispronouncing Maya's name. He is eventually elected senator and is later faced with a decision involving his friend, Jack Hunter. He returned in the series finale.[3]\n Angela Moore (Trina McGee) is Shawn Hunter's former high school girlfriend. Angela makes an appearance in \"Girl Meets Hurricane\", where she not only reveals to Shawn the tragic news that her father Sgt. Moore (Julius Carry) died in a fishing accident, but also that she has gotten married to a man in the service. Her reason for meeting up with Shawn is to get some advice and counseling about her fears of becoming a mother, because she is worried that she may end up like her own mother. Shawn encourages Angela to start a family with her husband and experience the joy of being a parent. After this, Angela encourages Shawn to pursue a relationship with Katy and leaves to go back home.\n Chet Hunter (Blake Clark) is Shawn and Jack's late father who died of a heart attack in the sixth season of Boy Meets World. During his lifetime, he was in and out of his children's lives. Since his passing, he occasionally returns to Shawn as a spirit guide as seen near the end of \"Girl Meets Hurricane\".\n Thomas Jonathan Murphy (J. B. Gaynor) was an orphan whom Eric met while he was playing Santa Claus at the mall one Christmas. After Eric gave Tommy a toy for Christmas, Tommy became convinced that Eric was really Santa Claus and asked Eric for parents for Christmas. Eric, touched by the boy's request, decided to volunteer as Tommy's big brother. The two spent a great deal of time together, leading Eric to consider adopting him, but he later changed his mind so Tommy could go live with a family who could provide better support for him.\n Many years later, he resurfaces in \"Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels Goes to Washington\" as a political activist and founder of a website called Thorn in Your Side that reports on political scandals, with the latest one being about Senator Jefferson Davis Graham. He volunteers to help when Eric is nominated to run for senator of New York, though the others are unaware of his identity. Later, at a debate against Eric's opponent, Senator Jefferson Davis Graham, Tommy reveals his identity and speaks of Eric's compassion and how Eric had sacrificed himself for Tommy's future. Eric joyfully reunites with Tommy who expresses his desire to continue working with Eric's campaign.\n Jonathan Turner (Anthony Tyler Quinn) was an English teacher who taught Cory, Shawn, and Topanga in high school. He was a laid back teacher who wore a leather jacket and rode a motorcycle. At one point, he became a father figure to Shawn and admits to loving him like a son. After his motorcycle accident, Jonathan fell in love with his nurse and married her.\n Mr. Turner returns in \"Girl Meets the New Teacher\", where he is now a superintendent who personally hired Cory Matthews to teach history at John Quincy Adams Middle School. He is called in to oversee the class of Harper Burgess to see if she is worth keeping around after Principal Yancy threatened to fire her and Cory; like Mr. Turner in Boy Meets World, Harper uses comic books in her lessons and rides a motorcycle to work. Riley sees Mr. Turner as an uncle figure as he has formed an even closer affinity with the Matthews family than before, visiting their home often. Although thankful to him for being a good educator, Topanga holds a grudge against Turner because he gave her an A- in high school. He returned in the series finale.[3]\n Jack Hunter (Matthew Lawrence) is Shawn's paternal half-brother and was Eric's best friend in college. Jack competed with Eric for the affection of Rachel McGuire. He and Rachel joined the Peace Corps at the end of Boy Meets World, but Jack eventually left while Rachel stayed behind. The two have since lost touch, while Eric and Rachel still talk often.\n Reappearing in \"Girl Meets Semi-Formal\", Jack now works for a corporation that is not environmentally friendly and has been assigned to persuade Senator Eric Matthews to allow his company to build a pipeline somewhere. Eric takes it upon himself to try and show Jack a simpler time to change his ways by taking him to the semi-formal dance where he meets Riley.\n Jennifer Bassett Minkus (Kristanna Loken) was once Shawn Hunter's girlfriend back in high school. However, she was an extremely arrogant and vindictive person who tried to keep Cory and Shawn apart. She returned in \"Girl Meets I Am Farkle\" where it is revealed that she is married to Stuart Minkus, and is Farkle's mother.[5] It is shown that Jennifer is a changed woman proving herself to be a sweet, caring mother of Farkle and wife of Stuart. She supports her son while waiting to find out if he is diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.\n Morgan Matthews (Lily Nicksay and Lindsay Ridgeway) is the younger sister of Cory and Eric, older sister of Joshua, and Riley and Auggie's aunt. Both actresses who played Morgan in Boy Meets World, Nicksay (who portrayed Morgan in seasons one and two) and Ridgeway (who portrayed Morgan in seasons three through seven), returned in the series finale, where both portrayed Morgan on-screen simultaneously. This was the character's only appearance in Girl Meets World.[3]\n The episodes of Girl Meets World that have aired are the source of most of the information in this article.\n", " \n Thomas Shaftesbury \"Tom\" Smith (c. 1893 \u2013 c. 1965) was a rugby union player who represented Australia.\n Smith, a prop, claimed a total of 12 international rugby caps for Australia.\n \n", " Chalup\u00e1\u0159i (The Cottagers) is a Czechoslovak comedy TV series filmed in 1974 and 1975 by Franti\u0161ek Filip.\n When former supervisor Ev\u017een Huml, now on disability pension, returns from the spa to the small flat where he lives with the rest of his family in the small room behind the bathroom, he decides to move out of Prague to the peaceful countryside.

Warden is a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy.   His Air Force career spanned 30 years, from 1965 to 1995, and included tours in Vietnam, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Korea, as well as many assignments within the continental United States. Warden completed a number of assignments in the Pentagon, was a Special Assistant for Policy Studies and National Security Affairs to the Vice President of the United States, and was Commandant of the Air Command and Staff College.\n John Warden has been called \"the leading air power theorist in the U.S. Air Force in the second half of the twentieth century\".[1] He has also been called \"one of the most creative airmen of our times. John Warden is not just a creative airman; he is one of America's premier strategic thinkers\".[1]\n \"Warden's career was marked with brilliance and controversy, and to this day his name inspires both warm affection and cold contempt in the defense establishment. He was, and still is a controversial and influential figure in the defense establishment in general, and the U.S. Air Force in particular\".[1]\n His impact on the future of air power in the United States Air Force is still being assessed, but \"several distinguished military historians, officers, and other experts have concluded that Warden defined the very terms of reference for the 1991 Desert Storm military strategy and thereby introduced a new approach to the conduct of war\".[2][3][4]\n John A. Warden III was born in McKinney, Texas in 1943 and was the fourth in his family to pursue a military career.  He earned his Bachelor of Science degree with a major in National Security Affairs in 1965 from the Air Force Academy and his master's degree from Texas Tech University in 1975, with his thesis focused exclusively on decision-making at the Grand Strategic level.\n In 1965 (on his twenty-second birthday), he married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie \"Margie\" Ann Clarke, and on December 5, 1966 became the father of twins, Elizabeth Kathleen, and John Warden IV.\n While still at the Air Force Academy, Warden started to become disillusioned with the future of the Air Force.  He was concerned that air power would play a secondary role to the Army and briefly considered transferring to that service and enrolling in West Point.\n It was at that moment in his career that he was introduced to the military theorist, Major General J.F.C. Fuller, through his book, The Generalship of Alexander The Great.[5]  General Fuller quickly became Warden's \"intellectual mentor\" and was instrumental in forming his lifelong interest in history and strategy, and what has come to be called the \"science\" of war.[6]\n In April 1967, Warden was a member of the 334th Tactical Fighter Squadron, flying the F4 Phantom II, when he was first deployed overseas to South Korea in response to the Pueblo incident.\n In 1969, then a Captain, Warden volunteered for duty in the Republic of Vietnam.  His assignment was to fly the OV-10 Bronco as a Forward Air Controller.  Warden participated in 266 combat missions by the time his tour ended.[7]  On several occasions, his aircraft was damaged by enemy fire, once very seriously.  The North American Aviation newsletter in 1969 reported that it was the most seriously damaged OV-10 that had managed to land safely.\n Like many other young officers who came of age during that conflict, Warden was very much affected by the sometimes conflicting rules of engagement and the lack of an overarching strategy to guide the conduct of that war.  That experience was the foundation for his emerging theories on the use of air power and the importance of strategy.\n Just as it did for another young officer, Colin Powell, as enunciated in the \"Powell Doctrine\", Vietnam taught Warden some important lessons about warfare: you need a consistent strategic approach; overwhelming force; clear objectives; an exit strategy, and integration of the political and military dimensions.  For Warden, good tactics simply could not overcome a flawed strategy.\n As a major, Warden arrived at the Pentagon in August 1975. Within the Directorate of Plans, Warden was assigned duties in the Middle East Section, and began his familiarity with that region of the world. This was to culminate in his contributions to the conduct of the First Gulf War.\n It was also at this point in his career that he began to attract attention from senior officers and members of the Intelligence Community, both for his ability to think strategically and conceptually, and for his ideas about force structure, concepts, and doctrine, that normally did not interest fighter pilots.[1]\n Warden had also begun to become something of a lightning rod, in that he was not afraid to forcefully express his views, even to senior officers, and was somewhat impatient with those who disagreed with him, as well as with the structure and the chain of command.  Warden was at this point, and would remain throughout his career, the \"quintessential air power advocate\", and a very controversial figure.[8]\n Warden has been compared to famed aviator Billy Mitchell: \"a thinker on a grand scale; a rebel who constantly sought ways to improve himself and his organization without having the patience to explain his reasoning or seek consensus; a revolutionary who refused to take political and personal sensitivities into account in his eagerness to change things fast, and a gentleman of unfailing integrity\".[9]\n As a Lieutenant Colonel, Warden  began a series of operational assignments which were a necessary requirement for the command track, and an opportunity to reach General Officer status.  Warden's operational assignments:\n Warden was promoted to Colonel at the age of thirty nine and selected for the National War College.  Colonel Warden's first book, The Air Campaign: Planning for Combat was published from his National War College research in 1988.[10]  In it, he defined his theories of airpower.  Many of the concepts in the book became the framework for the air campaign in the First Gulf War, and formed the basis for what is now known as the Prometheus Strategic Planning System.\nThe Air Campaign further cemented Warden's reputation as a brilliant, but controversial strategist.  In this complex book, he focused on the concept of air power as a determinant factor in modern warfare.  He directly challenged the prevailing doctrine entitled AirLand Battle, which held that air power must always play a subordinate role to ground operations, and was not strategic in and of itself.\nAir Force historian Richard P. Hallion noted, \"the book had a profound effect on the American defense establishment\".[11]\n In 1989, after a tour of duty as Wing Commander of the Thirty-Sixth Tactical Fighter Wing in Bitburg, Germany, Colonel Warden was again assigned to the Pentagon.  He was placed in charge of the Directorate of Warfighting Concepts, where he continued to conceive, develop, and promote his ideas surrounding air power, particularly that land-based air power now constituted the dominant form of national presence and power projection; as captured in the phrase he coined; \"Global Reach \u2013 Global Power\" [12]\n Colonel Warden was acknowledged as a \"catalyst and provocateur\" [1] by Air Force Secretary Donald Rice and Lieutenant General Michael Dugan during the significant intellectual and conceptual changes undertaken by the U.S. Air Force in the period 1988-90.\n Warden was widely acknowledged at the time to be the Pentagon's premier authority on air power strategy.[1]  Warden instructed Checkmate, which had merged with the Mission Area Analysis Division to become the Force Assessment Division (XOXWF) under his command, to look beyond traditional AirLand Battle doctrine and to focus on potential trouble spots, paying special attention to the Persian Gulf.\n Sarah Baxter of the London Sunday Times said of Checkmate:\n Project Checkmate was formed in 1970s to counter Soviet threats, but fell into disuse in 1980s.  It was revived under Colonel John Warden and was responsible for drawing up plans for the crushing air blitz against Saddam Hussein at the opening of the first Gulf War in 1991. [13]\n When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Saddam Hussein's move took nearly everyone by surprise.  General Norman Schwarzkopf, who was in charge of the CENTCOM (Central Command) area telephoned the Pentagon on August 8 and asked that the Air Force \"put planners to work on a strategic bombing campaign aimed at Iraq's military, which would provide the retaliatory options we needed.\" Schwarzkopf needed two things: a way to defend Saudi Arabia, and the ability to strike Iraq if Saddam made a crazy move.\n The model that came to mind was Operation El Dorado Canyon, the 1986 American air raid on Libya, in which USAF and Navy aircraft struck Libyan sites in retaliation for Muammar Qaddafi's terrorism. The Commander-in-Chief (CINC) needed something like the Libya raid, on a larger scale\".[14]\n The planning to liberate Kuwait originated with Warden's group of air power advocates in the Air Staff.  Warden and his team at Checkmate had reacted quickly to the task laid out by Generals Powell and Schwarzkopf, and had laid out a strategic and offense-oriented plan, that, while it underwent vigorous review and revision, put the initiative in coalition hands and resulted in the overwhelming victory of Desert Storm. Colin Powell stated, \"His original concept remained at the heart of the Desert Storm Air Campaign\" [15]\n Norman Schwarzkopf declared that \"together we mapped out the strategic concept that ultimately led to our country's great victory in Desert Storm\".[16]  Warden's \"Five Rings Model\" was a central element in the presentation to General Schwarzkopf of the general outline for the Air Campaign in late August, 1990.[1]\n David Halberstam asserted in War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton, and the Generals (2002):\n ...if one of the news magazines had wanted to run on its cover the photograph of the man who had played the most critical role in achieving victory, it might well have chosen Warden instead of Powell or Schwarzkopf..[17]\n Warden's view of the enemy as a 'system' and of the primary importance of the command, control, and communications apparatus within that system, combined with his belief in bombing for functional disruption, strategic paralysis, and systemic effect, was at the heart of the Instant Thunder air campaign in the first Gulf War, and has played an important role in changing the United States view of Warfighting at both the strategic and operational levels.\n His theories on effects-based planning, and his radical ideas about air power's purposes and applications, have made him probably the most influential air power theorist since the Second World War.[1]\n In 1991, at the recommendation of the Secretary of the Air Force, Donald B. Rice, Colonel Warden became the Special Assistant for Policy Studies and National Security Affairs to the Vice President of the United States, Dan Quayle. Warden represented the Office of the Vice President on numerous interagency policy coordinating committees and focused on American productivity and competitiveness.  Quayle credited Warden with having finalized the Manufacturing Technology Initiative,[citation needed] a plan announced in 1992 that provided for American company representatives to study Japanese manufacturing processes in Japan.[18] a bilateral agreement that enabled American enterprises to become increasingly familiar with Japanese production technology. Quayle also credited Warden with introducing senior government officials to the Six Sigma concept of business management and quality control, and with strengthening National Security through the enhancement of industrial competitiveness.\n As Commandant of the ACSC for three years, Colonel Warden completely changed the entire structure and curriculum from a focus on the tactics and techniques of war, to a focus on the real objectives of war.[1]  During his time in command of the college, he intended to make it a world class educational institution for mid-career officers.  Warden and his team transformed what had been an isolated academic institution into one that attracted the notice of the Pentagon, the Department of Defense, and various research communities.\n During his tenure, the school received several official honors, such as the General Muir S. Fairchild Educational Achievement Award [19] in 1994 and 1995.  Colonel Warden's impact will be felt for years to come as the more than eighteen hundred Majors who graduated during his time as Commandant, some of whom have already reached General Officer rank, continue their careers in the Air Force.[20]\n John Warden retired from the Air Force in June 1995, and shortly thereafter started his own consulting company to pursue the application of strategy in the business world.  He co-authored, with Leland A. Russell, Winning in FastTime,[21] in which he encapsulates his ideas and theory about strategy and effects-based planning into a process they call \"Prometheus\".[22]\n The Gulf War Air Power Survey documents how Warden managed to \"define the debate on the military strategy for 1991 through his presentations to Generals Powell and Schwarzkopf\".[23]\n The U.S. Air Force History Office, after extensive research, concludes that Warden introduced a new approach to the conduct of war; an air- and leadership-centric paradigm diametrically opposed to the AirLand Battle doctrine that relegated air power to a supporting role.  Scholars such as Robert A. Pape, Edward N. Luttwak, Alan Stephens, Richard P. Hallion, and Phillip S. Meilinger all agree that Warden is one of the most influential strategists since the Second World War.[24]\n The historian David R. Mets wonders in The Air Campaign: John Warden and the Classical Airpower Theorists[25] whether John Warden belongs in the pantheon of such great airpower thinkers as Giulio Douhet; Hugh Trenchard; and Billy Mitchell.\n Federation Starship John A.

The story is set in 1939 Albania and revolves around two main threads. It depicts a couple on a trip in the mountainous north of the country during their honeymoon (starring Vangjush Furxhi and Rajmonda Bulku) and the last days of freedom of a 26-year-old highlander (Piro Qirjo), who has taken revenge for his brother's death, in respect of the traditional law of the region, the Kanun. \n The writer Besian Vorpsi (Vangjush Furxhi) is waiting in the hall of the Royal Palace. Before him, a police officer (Gjon Karma) has been summoned by the King's adjutant (Luan Qerimi) to follow the new austerity measures the King's government has taken after 62 men have been convicted of serious political guilt. The adjutant goes on to explain that most of them were communists, among whom he shows Martin Alushi (Timo Flloko), who has translated Marx's works and is interned in the north of Albania under the supervision of a local prince. Next, the three main religious leaders of Albania get called in. A pack of Camel cigarettes and a photo of the Albanian King Zog is shown on a table, while the adjutant seeks the leaders' support for the King's policies. After them Besian Vorpsi gets received in. The adjutant demands Besian as an influential writer, to go to the north and assure the local prince of the King's support and inviolability of the Kanun. Besian is firstly reluctant to obey since he is getting married in few days, but the adjutant convinces him to spend the honeymoon there and simultaneously do the job. \n Couples are shown dancing under a dim light and Siegfried's Funeral March of Wagner\u2019s G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung is playing in the background. Besian Vorpsi declares that he and his wife Diana (Rajmonda Bulku) will spend their honeymoon in the northern highlands.[2] Cezar, a Besian's colleague, calls him out on his decision implying that Besian is being politically used in going somewhere that he had himself previously dubbed as the \"territories of death\".[2] A quiet talk for the upcoming trip follows between the couple in their bedroom. Besian talks about the customs in the north and persuades Diana to come with him and enjoy the beauties of that region. Eventually the couple sets out on the journey to the north of Albania in a horse-drawn carriage. On the way, Besian shows to Diana a highlander with his typical costume and a black armband. He explains with admiration to her that the piece of cloth is a symbol that he either has to \"take blood\" (revenge) or is a target to be killed. \n Gjorg Berisha (Piro Qirjo), is waiting in an ambush near the road with his riffle. After the carriage leaves behind, Gjorg takes aim at an approaching man passing by. At first he hesitates and sighs, then aims again at his target and shoots the man. The couple hears the shooting too. The next moment Gjorg goes to see his victim. Shocked by what he has done he runs away and tells about his killing to the first men he sees so that they can turn his victim right, according to the tradition. Then he runs into Martin Alushi and tells him the same thing. The couple arrives to a guesthouse at night. Next morning Gjorg wakes up, goes to his sheep and plays the flute. He contemplates to his sister about this custom of revenge, calling the killing as horrible and saying that attending the funeral of his victim and the lunch after it is meaningless and unbearable. Meanwhile the couple is having breakfast and Besian notices through his binoculars how in the neighbouring tower, they are washing the blood from the old victim's shirt (Gjorg's brother) since he now was vindicated, while on the other tower they are raising the new bloodshed shirt (Gjorg's victim) as a symbol for an upcoming revenge. Church bells are heard to signal the funeral. The couple sees from the distance how both the victim's and the killer's father attend the funeral in silence, while the killer is also with them. \nAfter the funeral, Gjorg and his father have a short talk at home. His father gives him a sack of money, so he can pay the \"blood tax\" (money paid for 1 month truce) to the prince.\nThe couple stops for a coffee at a guesthouse near a church. In the same place, Gjorg has a short break. Before he resumes his walk, Diana sees him and secretly takes a photo of him. They continue the trip in the carriage, where Besian rebukes her for taking that shot, but quickly forgets about it as they see again Gjorg walking along the way. Near the road, two gendarmes are dragging down a man for being indebted with a local Bajraktar. Martin Alushi tries to intervene but is pushed away by the gendarmes. Besian stops the carriage and gets out. He recognizes Martin and doesn't speak. This infuriates Martin who knows the writer and calls his silence and his trip a shame.  \nIn the evening, Gjorg arrives in the prince's tower, followed by the couple. While Besian and Diana are welcomed by the prince (Mario Ashiku) dressed in local costume, Gjorg and the other men who had killed for blood feud are waiting in a room to pay the \"blood tax\". Mark Uka\u00e7jerra (Reshat Arbana) who is the blood feud\u2019s reeve, summons Gjorg and fills his name in a list. Gjorg gives the money and Mark tells him he has one month truce (6 March \u2013 6 April). The prince, now wearing a tuxedo, receives the couple with a lavish dinner. He talks about the Kanun and Gjakmarrja. The prince and Mark complain about the diminishing blood feuds. Diana asks if they earn money from these blood feuds, and her husband looks at her angrily. The prince replies that the Kanun is a thousand year old, and neither did he invent it or earn from it, but he only guards it. When alone together, the prince makes Mark guilty of the diminishing income since people are giving up on the blood feud. Late at night Besian wakes up, leaves the room and goes to talk to the prince. His wife is worried and goes to look for him. Besian tells the prince that the King esteems his power in the north of the country and supports him, without wanting to interfere in the prince's local authority and the Kanun. On the other hand, the prince appreciates Besian's writings and visit and shows him gratitude. \n The next morning in the carriage, Diana confronts Besian on why he didn't come to her at night and that he is hiding something to her. She looks at him doubtfully and they leave in silence with the carriage. While travelling, the couple assists a property dispute and the curious Besian and his wife get closer. A geometer approaches Besian and tells him to write about the difficult life they live in, without having the right to exercise their professions and dubbing all that as a \"tragicomedy\".   \n Gjorg is counting his remaining days of freedom. He decides to go up the mountains during his remaining days. His father hands him 2 bullets while his sister ties him the black armband and gives him the flute. On his way, Gjorg runs into Mark Uka\u00e7jerra. Mark tells that he would forgive Gjorg's blood feud and spare his life if he kills a King's enemy, the interned man. Gjorg shakes his head for no and leaves in silence. Along the way he notices a traditional wedding moment and imagines if he was the groom instead. In the carriage, Besian tells to Diana he will go to meet a local leader while she can wander and photograph around. Diana gets into a poor house in miserable conditions where the housewife complains the authorities have jailed her husband. In the carriage Diana talks about her bad impressions inside the tower and recalls a poem of Migjeni. On his way, Gjorg has a friendly encountering with Martin and two highlanders. But they all stand up and leave when Mark approaches.  \nMartin meets his wife who has come from Tirana. She talks about politics, that Italy has sent an ultimatum to Albania and that the fascists may be disembarking unexpectedly. She tells him that the people have no trust in the Kingdom's army anymore. Their meeting is short because a gendarme is waiting for them. \n On the way back, Besian and Diana's carriage sees that Cezar is a new convicted. He is tied and guarded by three gendarmes, what doesn't impede him from speaking angrily and feeling revolted at Besian. Meantime Mark Uka\u00e7jerra meets a traditional judge of Kanun, asking him a false judgement, but he denies. \nBesian stops the carriage and together with Diana goes to meet a doctor he recognizes. He had studied in Austria for microbiology. After coming back to Albania he had made a study to eradicate malaria, but was treated as a madman for his requests and sent to the north. He goes on to explain Besian that now he serves as a type of judge who has to check and decide upon the wounds of a killed man on blood feud, so as each wound on the body is paid differently. A fierce argument starts between them and Diana leaves and hides away. After Besian finds her, Diana accuses him of playing the deaf and blind in this tragedy.\n In the next scene, Martin goes to cut timber. While he is cutting down a poplar tree with an axe, Mark hidden on the ground shoots at him. Gjorg Berisha is wandering nearby and upon hearing the shot, runs at Martin, asking who shot.\nThe dying Martin replies that the King and the Tower shot at him, but this order will collapse and then everything will be different. Hearing the shot, several men approach the scene. Gjorg tells that there is no greater shame than to shoot behind the back of an innocent who was not even from there, declaring that the King, the prince and Mark Uka\u00e7jerra shot him, opening up about the later's promise to spare his life if he would shoot at Martin. When the group leaves, a boy reads aloud one of Martin's papers \"The King is disarming the people and is selling the country to the foreigners\".\n The next day Gjorg is wandering on a plain and turns up his head to see a passing airplane. A gunshot is heard and he falls to the ground with arms wide open. Sometime after the shot, Besian and Diana's carriage happen to drive close to him and they stop in silence to see his dead body. More airplanes are heard to fly above them. On the late afternoon they stop at a government office to call the Royal court in Tirana but nobody replies. Then the carriage gets ambushed by a group of armed highlanders, who assumed the king and the queen were inside. Realizing it is not them, they leave. Besian asks a gendarme who reveals that the King has left the country and the kingdom is falling down. After the carriage leaves, he takes off the uniform and ties a reddish scarf around the neck, a symbol of the Partisans\u2019 Resistance. As the carriage continues, a long line of armed highlanders are marching. \"Albania is attacked by an enemy. The feuds are closed.\" \u2015 two of them say. More airplanes patrol the sky throwing flyers down. Besian goes out to see and returns in desperation to Diana. The armed highlanders continue to walk in line and the film ends.[3]\n The film T\u00eb paftuarit was awarded with the third Prize of the 7th Albanian Film Festival in April 1987.

They both have a daughter, Miriam who was born while in hiding. He reports that he converted after starting \"readings and comparative studies in religions\" finding that he was, \"not consistent with Islamic teachings.\" He claimed that \"the major issue for me was love. Islam wasn't promoting love as Christianity did.\"[1][2][3]\n Although Christianity is legal in Egypt, apostasy from Islam, or leaving it, is punishable by death under a widespread interpretation of Islamic law, but the state has never ordered or carried out an execution.[1][2][3] Theoretically, Egyptian law must be derived from Islamic law, according to a ruling several decades ago. Converts are often harassed by police, who use laws against, \"insulting religion\" or \"disturbing public order\" to justify legal action against them. Hegazy reports that after his conversion was discovered, he was detained for three days and tortured by police. In 2001, he published a book of poems critical of security services and was held for three months for sedition, disturbing public order, and insulting the president and was eventually released without charge.[1][2][3]\n In 2007, Hegazy sued the Egyptian court to change his religion from \"Islam\" to \"Christianity\" on his national identification card. He said he wants to do this so that his child can be openly raised as a Christian, get a Christian birth certificate and marry in a church. He also stated that he wants to set a precedent for other converts.[1][2][3]\n His first lawyer, Mamdouh Nakhlah filed the case, but then quit after Hegazy's conversion caused a major uproar. Nakhlah told the Associated Press that he initially accepted the case because of an editorial last month by one of Egypt's highest Islamic clerics, the Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa, who wrote against the killing of apostates, saying there is no worldly retribution for Muslims who abandon their religion.[1][2][3][4]\n Gomaa's comments were sharply criticized by Muslim conservatives, who felt that he was opening the door for Muslims to leave their faith. Sheikh Gad al-Ibrahim told Al-Quds al-Arabi that \"the Egyptian government should find Mohammed Hegazy and apply shari'a, giving him three days to reconvert and then killing him if he refuses\". Sheikh Youssef al-Badri and Souad Saleh, a professor at Egypt's al-Azhar university where Egypt's top Islamic scholars work, agreed with Al-Ibrahim, openly challenging statements by Egypt's second highest religious authority last month that apostasy from Islam should not be punished in this world. Gomaa later clarified his controversial statement by saying that only apostates who \"actively engaged in the subversion of society\" should be punished.[1][2][3][4]\n However, sharia is enshrined as the basis of Egypt's legal code in Article 2 of the constitution, and many Muslims see no distinction between apostasy and subversion. A second lawyer, Ramsis Raouf Al-Naggar, announced he would take up the case but then refused. Al-Naggar has stated that he is pessimistic that the suit could be won because of all the conflict surrounding it. He said that Hegazy had not given them the necessary church documents that could be used in court as evidence of his conversion to Christianity. Hegazy recently told reporters that he had found a new solicitor but declined to reveal the name for security reasons.[1][2][2][3][4]\n Hegazy raised a storm of controversy when pictures of him posing for journalists with a poster of the Virgin Mary were published in the newspapers.[1][2][3]\n Fatwas were issued by Muslim clerics calling for Hegazy's death. Under at least one fatwa, Hegazy's daughter Miriam will be killed at the age of 10 if she does not choose Islam. Hegazy and his wife have decided to remain in Egypt and go ahead with the case, in spite of the various fatwas issued against him and his family.[1][2][3]\n He has received death threats by telephone. He and his wife have been ostracized by their families and are currently in hiding. Christine's family has sworn to kill her because she married a non-Muslim against the family's wishes.\n Hegazy's family was also angry with him. In a 2008 interview to a local Egyptian newspaper, Hegazy's father said, \"I am going to try to talk to my son and convince him to return to Islam. If he refuses, I am going to kill him with my own hands.\"\n Shortly after, Hegazy released this statement in response to his father:\n I would like to send a message to my dad. I saw what you said in the newspapers. You say you want to kill me; to shed my blood in public. But I love you so much because you are my dad and because Jesus taught me to love. I accepted Jesus Christ willingly and nobody forced me. I forgive you. No matter what decision you make. No matter what you do. To my dad and mom, I say Jesus Christ died to save me.[5]\n On August 8, 2007, Egyptian police detained two Christian human rights workers, Adel Fawzy Faltas and Peter Ezzat, after their organisation was involved in several controversial human rights cases, including Mohammed Hegazy's. They were subsequently held without charge and had their detention renewed on August 21. The two activists are members of the Middle East Christian Association (MICA). A Canadian non-governmental organisation applying for legal recognition with the Egyptian government in June 2007, MICA was involved in several controversial human rights cases.[4]\n According to their lawyer, Peter Ramses al-Nagar, the main reason for Faltas and Ezzat's detention was their work with Christian convert Mohammed Hegazy. He reported that the media have been saying that Faltas and Ezzat were arrested because they are the main reason that Hegazy became a Christian. Faltas had conducted a high-profile Internet interview with Mohammed Hegazy only days before his arrest, sparking claims in Egyptian media that he had led the Muslim to Christianity.[4]\n During a telephone interview with an Egyptian talk show, Fawzy said that Islamic scholars had accused his organisation of converting Mohammed Hegazy to Christianity. \"The first question they asked was whether we converted Mr Hegazy,\" Mr Fawzy told reporters. \"I told them, 'We don't convert anyone; we are a human rights organisation. But even if we had, there is no law against that.'\"[4]\n In February, 2008, an Egyptian judge, Muhammad Husseini of a court in Cairo ruled that a Muslim who converted to Christianity cannot legally change his religious status, although he may believe what he wants in his heart. Judge Muhammad Husseini said that according to sharia, Islam is the final and most complete religion and therefore Muslims already practice full freedom of religion and cannot convert to an older belief (Christianity or Judaism). Husseini also told the administrative court that Hegazy \"can believe whatever he wants in his heart, but on paper he can't convert.\"[6]\n Judge Husseini based his decision on Article 2 of the Egyptian constitution, which makes sharia the source of Egyptian law. Hegazy has denounced the ruling as a violation of his basic rights. \"What does the state have to do with the religion I embrace?\" Hegazy questioned, according to the United States Copts Association following the ruling.[6]\n The convert's defense team was also disappointed with the verdict: \"The judge didn't listen to our defense, and we didn't even have a chance to talk before the court,\" said Gamel Eid, head of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) to the Copts Association. An ANHRI representative said that Hegazy still plans to appeal the ruling or possibly open a new case. Katarina also plans to file a petition for her right to change her religion to Christianity.[6]\n In Egypt, a child's registered religion is based on the father's official faith. Therefore, since Hegazy is officially Muslim, his daughter would not be able to enroll in Christian religious classes at school, wed in a church, or attend church services openly without harassment under Egyptian law.[6]\n However, in a different case in the same month, an Egyptian court ruled that twelve Coptic Christians who converted to Islam and then reverted to Christianity could have their faith officially recognised. This decision was reached on the grounds that the Copts should not be considered apostates for converting from Islam because they had been born Christian. The decision overturned a lower court ruling that said the state need not recognise conversions from Islam because of a religious ban.\n A lawyer for the twelve Coptic Christians described the case as a victory for human rights and freedom of religion. He said that it could open the door for hundreds of other Copts who want to revert to their original faith from Islam.\n[7]\n", " The Farnborough/Aldershot built-up area or Blackwater Valley Conurbation or Aldershot Urban Area is the name used by the ONS to refer to the loose conurbation on the border between Surrey, Berkshire and Hampshire in England.

Chalmers (born early 1900s) was an American-born actress, inventor, and author.\n Leona W. Chalmers was born in the early 1900s. She was an inventor, actress, and author. She is known for inventing the menstrual cup. She was also an author, who wrote the book \u2018The Intimate Side of a Woman\u2019s Life\u2019[1]. The menstrual cup is a reusable, funnel like device that can be placed in a woman\u2019s vagina to collect her menstrual fluid. With a menstrual cup, one wouldn\u2019t need to use a tampon or pad. At the moment, reusable menstrual instruments only make up of 2%, of menstrual instruments used by women around the world. However, these items are increasing in popularity, due to their reusable nature, and comfort they provide women.\n Before Chalmers\u2019 invention, most people used \u2018Catamenial Sacks\u2019, which menstruators would don a belt that utilized either metal cups or flexible sacs. However these were uncomfortable and hard to use. Thus, Leona patented a rubber cup that didn\u2019t utilize a belt and was more comfortable than the prior innovation. More importantly, it was invisible, and was more discreet than the Catamenial sack. The production of her first patent in 1937 was stymied by a shortage in rubber due to World War 2[2]. However, she still tried to sell her cups well into the ends of the 1950s. People were generally reticerant towards the idea of inserting the menstrual cup digitally into their vaginas, preventing most from trying these cups.\n In 1959, Chalmers sold the rights to the design of the cup to Robert P. Oreck, who launched a new company called Tassette Inc[3]. It was incredibly hard for the company to gain traction, as marketing the product was virtually impossible. At the time, utilizing the words \u2018vagina\u2019 and \u2018period\u2019 were almost forbidden to use in advertisement. As a result, the company shut down in 1973. However, menstrual cups are now making a comeback, over 25 years after the inception of Tassette. This is due to environmental concerns, as one cup purchased saves 2800+ tampons from going to a landfill[4].\n \n", " \n Buddleja speciosissima is a rare species restricted to Mount Itatiaia in Brazil, where it grows in rocky grassland at altitudes of 2,000 - 2,500\u00a0m; it was first described and named by Taubert in 1893.[1][2]\n Buddleja speciosissima is a shrub 1 \u2013 3\u00a0m high with light-brown fissured bark.

Nicknamed Los Bohemios (\"The Bohemians\"), Atlanta is mostly known for its football team, although the institution also hosts the practise of boxing, martial arts, handball and roller skating.[1]\nThe squad currently plays at Primera B Nacional, the second division of the Argentine football league system.\n The club was founded on 12 October 1904 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. One source says that the team got its name from an earthquake that had struck Atlanta, Georgia[2] in the United States at the time the founders got together to inaugurate the club. Another version about its foundation states that the name \"Atlanta\" was taken from a navy ship that had arrived in the port of Buenos Aires when Manuel Quintana was proclaimed as President of Argentina.[3] Elias Sanz was named as the club's first president.\n The club's colors, yellow and blue, where chosen from the awnings that decorated the neighborhood's stores in those years.[2] Atlanta's first home field was in Juan B. Alberdi y Escalada Avenue of the Villa Luro neighborhood,[3] but the club would move repeatedly. This constant movement is the reason why the club was nicknamed Los Bohemios, the Bohemians, which has remained the nickname for the club and its supporters.\n At the beginning of 1906, Atlanta was affiliated to the third division of the Argentine Football Association. The team debuted on 22 April 1906, winning its match against Racing. During its first season Atlanta reached the semifinals but then lost to Club Gath & Chaves by 2\u20130. That same year Atlanta merged with Club Atl\u00e9tico del Oeste, keeping its original name.\n Atlanta won the third division championship in 1907, winning its first official title. The team defeated Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires by 4\u20131 on November 10. The highlight of that season was the thrashing victory over Independiente by 21\u20131. After winning the title, Atlanta debuted in the second division in 1908, winning the \"Copa Bullrich\" that played at the same time than regular season. The squad defeated Instituto Americano from Adrogu\u00e9 by 2\u20131 at the final, played on September 8.\n The club is often associated with the Jewish community because of the historical support of Jews in the area of Villa Crespo; notable Jews have also been part of the team's administration and squad (e.g. Fabian Lagman and Jaime Jos\u00e9 Rotman).[4]\n Atlanta's main rival is Chacarita Juniors. The rivalry originated in 1922, when Chacarita established very close to Atlanta's home and stadium. The Funebrero stayed there until 1930 when they moved to San Mart\u00edn, in Greater Buenos Aires, where they have remained since, although the rivalry with Atlanta never ended.\n The first official match between both teams was on 13 November 1927 and Chacarita won 2\u20130. The first time Atlanta defeated the Funebrero was in 1930, with a score of 1\u20130. In the professional era, the first contest between Atlanta and Chacarita was on 4 June 1931, with Atlanta winning 3\u20131.\n Atlanta and Chacarita have played each other 126 times: Atlanta have won 34, scoring 144 goals. On the other side, Chacarita have won 54 games and scored 191 goals. They have drawn 38 times. The biggest win achieved by Atlanta was in 1944, when they defeated Chacarita 7\u20131.\n Santiago Rico played the most games for Atlanta with 16 appearances, while Luciano Agnol\u00edn is the top scorer with 7 goals.\n The team stadium, \"Don Le\u00f3n Kolbovsky\", is located in Villa Crespo neighborhood, in the city of Buenos Aires. It was inaugurated in 1960 during a match between Atlanta and Argentinos Juniors. Its name is a tribute to the man who presided the club when the stadium began to be built and has a capacity of 34,000. It is also known as the \"Wooden Monumental\", in reference to River Plate's Estadio Monumental, the biggest and with the largest capacity in Argentina.\n In February 2005, the Government of Buenos Aires closed the stadium due to its poor sanitary and security conditions. In January 2006 the stadium was partially re-opened but it was closed again a month later. The same year Atlanta signed a contract with a company to build two concrete grandstands which would replace the wooden one that still stood there. Once the restructuring was finished, Atlanta could play its home games in its own stadium after three years. The Le\u00f3n Kolbovsky was re-opened in March 2009, when Atlanta defeated Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol 3\u20131 with 6,000 supporters in the new concrete grandstands.[5]\n Since the team lacked an official home stadium for its first six decades, it was nicknamed \"Los Bohemios\", as the team would wander from place to place forced to play \"home\" games in other team's stadiums. The label is also associated with the fans, or any supporter of the team. The singular form, \"El Bohemio\", is also accepted and can be used when referring to the organization, or a particular player or the actual team.\n One of the most curious cases in the history of the club refers to a dog, called \"Napole\u00f3n\" (whose name had been taken from the Emperor of the French) who would become a club legend. The dog had become famous in 1936, when before each match disputed by Atlanta, Napole\u00f3n used to show his skills with the ball to the spectators at the Villa Crespo stadium. The animal's awesome ability was claimed even by rival supporters.[6] The dog also barked fiercely when the rival team appeared on the field, and happily wagged his tail when Atlanta players appeared on the field. \"Once the referee started the match, Napole\u00f3n took his place outside the field and followed the movements of the ball. During a corner kick, the dog always stood behind the goal\"[7]\n Napole\u00f3n had been adopted by Atlanta players after a match against Talleres played in Remedios de Escalada: with the dog on the field, Atlanta scored 4 goals in the second half after being 5\u20131 down at half-time (when Napole\u00f3n could not stay with the team on field). The match finally ended with a 5\u20135 tie and therefore the dog was adopted by Atlanta players as their mascot, because they considered the dog had brought good luck to the team.\n On 6 April 1938, a group of Atlanta supporters met at the house of Napole\u00f3n's owner, Francisco Bel\u00f3n. They were making the arrangements to take Napole\u00f3n to La Plata for the match Atlanta had to play against Estudiantes. The front door of the house was left opened and the dog ran into the street, and was killed by a car. The newspaper Ahora titled the next day: \"Napole\u00f3n, a true ace of Porte\u00f1o football, passed away\"[8]\n Napole\u00f3n was not buried, but his body was embalmed and kept by his owner, Francisco Bel\u00f3n, in the house of Villa Crespo where he lived. On October 2004, when Atlanta celebrated its 100th anniversary, the embalmed body of Napol\u00e9on came back to the stadium (now called Le\u00f3n Kolvobsky) being exhibited by Francisco Bel\u00f3n's son, Osvaldo. The dog was one of the most loved symbols of the club, along with human celebrities as Osvaldo Miranda (proclaimed as the most famous Atlanta fan by the institution that evening) and Carlos Griguol.[9]\n [10]\n Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Meanwhile, over the skies of Chan's Honolulu, the \"Hopkins plane\" is demonstrating an improvement of remote radio control to the US military. However, the aircraft is hijacked by a concealed stowaway, the device stolen, and the test pilot murdered. When Chan, followed by his astute second son, Charlie Jr. (Layne Tom Jr.), tracks down the stowaway, he finds only the man's body.\n On the passenger list of the only aircraft to leave Honolulu for the mainland after the incident are Richard Masters (Allan Lane) and Yvonne Roland (Katherine DeMille). Masters was the intended test pilot, only he injured his shoulder and had to be replaced. It turns out, however, he left on the Pan Am Clipper to travel to the Olympics himself as a competitor. Perusing the list, Hopkins (Jonathan Hale) recognizes the name of arms dealer Arthur Hughes (C. Henry Gordon). Several of the suspects head for Germany by steamship.

Hughes advises Chan to stop investigating, then spots a gun barrel in a passing car and pushes the pair to safety. A shot strikes their compartment window. Later, Hughes arranges for Adams' camera to be stolen, but finds nothing inside.[2]\n A hotel maid tries to steal the invention, hidden in Adams' candy box, but is foiled by Chan and Strasser. When she runs to the window to warn her accomplices, Charlie substitutes a book for the device without being noticed. Hopkins insists on keeping the candy box in his hotel suite, where he is visited by Hughes. Chan and a policeman break in when they hear gunfire. They find Cartwright on the floor. He claims Hughes accused Hopkins of taking the device to double-cross the stockholders of his company, then after Hughes left, Hopkins took the invention at gunpoint and slugged him.\n Roland takes the candy box to her employer, diplomat the Honorable Charles Zaraka (Morgan Wallace). When they discover the substitution, Roland surmises that Chan has the device. Zaraka sends Chan a ticket to the opening ceremony. While Chan verbally spars with him and Roland, Lee is kidnapped.\n Chan allows himself to be taken to Zaraka to exchange the device for his son. Hopkins is brought in to verify it is the invention; he does (even though it is an imitation with a radio beacon inside). Satisfied, Zaraka orders his men to dispose of the Chans when Hughes and his men burst in. Hughes threatens to kill Lee if Chan does not produce the real equipment, but the police arrive just in time to rescue the detective. Hopkins is found unconscious from a gunshot in another room. Cartwright accuses Hughes of the shooting, but Chan proves that Cartwright was responsible for that and also the murder of his accomplice back in Honolulu.

He held the professorship of Hebrew and cognate languages at the University of the City of New York from 1836 to 1842, and received the appointment of instructor in sacred literature at Union Theological Seminary, where he remained from 1838 until 1842. He enjoyed the friendship of notable biblical scholars of his time, and many of his pupils later occupied posts of eminence.\n Among his contributions to the Biblical Repository, \"The Philosophy of Ecclesiastes\" (July 1838) was particularly notable. In 1838 he published the first volume of his elaborate Hebrew grammar, and in 1841 the second volume (2d ed., with additions and improvements, 2 vols., New York, 1842). Another work was A Grammatical Analysis of Select Portions of Scripture, or a Chrestomathy (New York, 1838).

At a length of 159.7 kilometres (99.2\u00a0mi), the route is significantly shorter than when it travelled beyond Hamilton to Niagara Falls. However, the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) replaced the role of Highway\u00a08 between those two cities, and that portion of the highway was subsequently transferred from provincial to local jurisdiction. Today the highway connects Hamilton and Cambridge, thereafter continuing through Southwestern Ontario to the community of Goderich on the shores of Lake Huron. The freeway segment of Highway 8 is known as the Freeport Diversion, King Street Bypass, or Highway 8 Expressway, with a short portion being internally designated by the province as Highway 7187. Highway 8 is multiplexed with with Highway 7 including a portion of the Conestoga Parkway.\n Until 1918, the majority of the primary roads through southern Ontario formed part of the County Road System. The Department of Public Works and Highways paid up to 60% of the construction and maintenance costs for these roads, while the counties were responsible for the remaining 40%. In 1919, the federal government passed the Canada Highways Act, which provided $20,000,000 to provinces under the condition that they establish an official highway network; up to 40% of construction costs would be subsidized. The first network plan was approved on February\u00a026, 1920, and included the Queenston Road.[2] The majority of what would soon become Highway\u00a08 was assumed by the department over the course of the year.[3]\nHowever, it would not receive a route number until the summer of 1925.[4]\n Up until the early 1970s, the highway was much longer than its current length, extending from Goderich through Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, and Hamilton to Niagara Falls. However, in 1970, the Government of Ontario decided that the stretch of Highway 8 between Winona (just east of Hamilton) and Niagara Falls was no longer of major transportation significance, since by this time most traffic used the QEW, just to the north, to go between the two locales. Accordingly, the province downloaded this section of the highway to the newly formed Regional Municipality of Niagara, which designated the road as Regional Road 81. In 1998, the provincial government of Mike Harris carried another downloading of the highway to municipal authorities; this time the section between the town of Peters Corners (near Dundas) and Winona was transferred to the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth.[5]\n In 2004, extensive improvements were completed around the former obsolete and bottle-necked \"half-cloverleaf\" interchange of the Conestoga Parkway and the Highway 8 Expressway in Kitchener. This included a new flyover semi-directional ramp from Conestoga westbound to Highway 8 eastbound, while the ramp in the opposite direction was realigned to allow it to carry two lanes of traffic at a higher speed.\n In 2002-2004 the Highway 8 Expressway was widened from four to eight lanes from the interchange to just east of Franklin Street, which necessitated moving one retaining wall and replacing the overpass which carries Franklin Street over the Highway 8 Expressway. From 2006 to 2012, there was the widening of the Highway Expressway to eight lanes past the interchange with Fairway Road (Waterloo Regional Road 53) and over the Grand River as far as the highway's next intersection with King Street about 6\u00a0km southward was undertaken.  It was completed in 2012.\n In September 2012, MTO completed the reconstruction of the three-road junction at Peters Corners in northern Hamilton, the eastern terminus of Highway 8, as a roundabout with separate traffic signals for the northern (Westover Road) and southeastern (Hamilton Road 8) arms.\n The interchange of Highway 8 and Highway 401 is planned to be expanded, with high speed flyover ramps linking Highway 401 west of that interchange directly to the Highway 8 Expressway; at the present Highway 401 traffic west of that junction has to use King Street East for a short distance to reach the Highway 8 Expressway.[6]\n Highway 8 begins at its western terminus in downtown Goderich, at the junction with Highway 21. It travels eastward as a rural two-lane highway (80\u00a0km/hr speed limit) with sections running through various towns and villages functioning as  normal city roads. In Stratford, it begins overlapping with Highway 7, becoming a four-lane city road before becoming a four-lane rural highway at the eastern boundary of the city. At New Hamburg, the combined Highway 7/8 turns into a four-lane controlled-access highway, becoming a freeway just west of Baden, and continues into Kitchener (where the 7/8 freeway is known as the Conestoga Parkway).\n As the Conestoga Parkway runs through Kitchener as a six-lane freeway, Highway 8 splits off by turning southeastward via an interchange, which was opened in 1970, while Highway 7 continues on the Conestoga Parkway to Waterloo. Mainline traffic on Highway 8 heading northwest could continue under the Conestoga, where the route defaults to King Street, to enter downtown Kitchener. The eight-lane Conestoga Parkway east/north of this junction serves as a bypass of King Street through central Kitchener and Waterloo, as in the north end of Waterloo, the Conestoga Parkway and King Street intersect again.\n Highway 8 continues along as eight-lane freeway, which is also known as the Freeport Diversion or King Street Bypass (but is often referred to by area residents as the Highway 8 Expressway), until another junction with King Street East after which it becomes six and then four lanes. Originally, the Highway 8 Expressway ended at an at-grade Y-junction with King Street East, with traffic from Highway 8 treated as the mainline traffic at that intersection.  Highway 8 and King Street then continued as a four-lane divided highway with access to adjacent commercial properties (60\u00a0km/hr speed limit) to Highway 401. In 1987, the Highway 8 Expressway was extended to provide a direct freeway link to Highway 401 eastbound with the non-public designation Highway 7187 (although it is signed as Highway 8), as the actual Highway 8 designation continues upon King Street East. As a result of the Highway 8 Expressway extension to Highway 401, the existing cloverleaf interchange between Highway 401 and King Street East was modified, with high-speed ramps directly connecting the Highway 8 Expressway to Highway 401 east of that interchange, however traffic on Highway 401 west of the interchange has to use has to use King Street East for a short distance to reach the Highway 8 Expressway.\n The historical Highway 8 then enters Cambridge, marked as Waterloo Regional Road 8 within the boundaries of the city, following city streets such as Shantz Hill Road, Fountain Street, King Street, Coronation Boulevard, and Dundas Street. It then continues as a King's Highway out of Cambridge and into Hamilton, meeting with Highway 5 at a roundabout in Peters Corners.\n Beyond this point, the road is no longer technically a King's Highway, and is officially designated as Hamilton Road 8, though numerous road signs and local custom still refer to it as Highway 8. From Peters Corners, Highway 8 continues through West Flamborough before turning south to descend the Niagara Escarpment into Dundas. In Dundas, Highway 8 follows King Street East, then turns south onto Main Street. Main Street changes names at Governor's Road to become Osler Drive. Once Highway 8 crosses the boundary into Hamilton proper, the road resumes the name Main Street.\n Highway 8 continues as Main Street through the Westdale neighbourhood of Hamilton, passing McMaster University, until it reaches Paradise Road just west of Highway 403. At this point, Highway 8 splits into two roads as it passes through the Hamilton downtown core. Highway 8 eastbound follows Main Street, which becomes a multi-lane one-way street from Paradise Road until its eventual intersection with King Street near Kensington Avenue in East Hamilton. Highway 8 westbound follows King Street, which is also a multi-lane one-way street between Kensington Avenue and Paradise Road, and then briefly follows Paradise Road itself to reconnect with Main Street. East of the intersection of King Street and Main Street, the two directions of Highway 8 merge, and the highway continues to follow Main Street.\n At the intersection of Main Street with Queenston Road, Highway 8 leaves Main Street and follows Queenston Road to continue its eastbound journey. East of Gray Road the designation of Queenston Road is dropped. Thereafter, the road is simply named Highway 8 until reaching Winona, where it becomes Niagara Regional Road 81.\n The following table lists the major junctions along Highway 8, as noted by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. Highway\u00a08 is maintained under a Connecting Link agreement within Goderich, Clinton, Seaforth, Mitchell, and Stratford.[7]\u00a0\n", " \n Cota tinctoria, the golden marguerite, yellow chamomile, or oxeye chamomile, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the sunflower family.

All the signs were there in the 1990s - the mania about resisting outside influences, the narrow religious beliefs, the harking back to a golden age, the sense of being under threat from modernity, the readiness to use violent means. The roots of it went back centuries. But it took the attacks of 9/11 for us to realise how powerful was this burgeoning extremism....We are not, of course, talking here about Islam or about al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, but about America. It is Anatol Lieven's contention in this illuminating book that Bin Laden's assault on the United States stripped away many of the remaining restraints on the intolerant, irrational, and self-destructive side of American nationalism.

About 100 meters off the northwestern end of the islands are the Beaver Stones (\u0411\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0438 in Russian), two islets connected by an isthmus, with a combined length of 1\u00a0km.\n The island was sighted by on 5 November 1741 by Bering and his crew while returning from the expedition during which he found America from the west, but he did not land on this island.[1]\n The Russian naval officer and historian Vasily Berch believed that Yemelyan Basov reached this island in 1745, during his second of four expeditions to the Commander Islands between 1743 and 1749, and that most of the furs he brought back to Kamchatka in 1745 were hunted on this island.[2]\n Towards the end of the 19th century, the settlement of Preobrazhenskoye was established by Aleuts who moved there from Attu Island.\n In 1970, all citizens of the island were moved to neighboring Bering Island. Until 2001, the island was occupied as a frontier post. Since then, the island has been completely uninhabited. Scientific studies of the fauna and flora are conducted annually.\n Medny Island is home to many Steller sea lions. 340 pups were born on the island in 1999, and 153 in 2016.[3]\n", " \n Senta Berger (German pronunciation: [\u02c8z\u025bnta \u02c8b\u025b\u0281\u0261\u0250] (listen); born 13 May 1941) is an Austrian film, stage and television actress, producer and author. She received many award nominations for her acting in theatre, film and television; her awards include three Bambi Awards, two Romys, an Adolf Grimme Award, both a Deutscher and a Bayerischer Fernsehpreis, and a Goldene Kamera.\n Berger is the daughter of musician Josef Berger and teacher Therese Jany.[1] She first appeared on stage at the age of four, when her father accompanied her singing on the piano. At the age of five she started ballet lessons.\n Berger also took private acting lessons. In 1957, she won her first small role in one of the final films directed by Austrian auteur Willi Forst. She applied for the Max Reinhardt Seminar, a famous acting school in Vienna, and was accepted, but she left shortly afterwards after accepting a film role without permission. In 1958, she became the youngest member of the Josefstadt Theatre in Vienna.\n In 1960 Bernhard Wicki and Artur Brauner produced the film The Good Soldier Schweik with Berger and the German actor Heinz R\u00fchmann. Brauner used Berger in several films, but she soon tired of musicals. In 1962, she went to Hollywood and worked with stars such as Charlton Heston, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Richard Widmark, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Yul Brynner. She returned to Germany to accept an offer for a role in a series, which would have brought[clarification needed] an obligation of several years.\n In 1963, Berger met Michael Verhoeven, son of the German film director Paul Verhoeven (not to be confused with the Netherlands Paul Verhoeven). In November 1964, she guest starred in an episode of the U.S. television show, The Man from U.N.C.L.E, entitled \"The Double Affair\". It was later expanded and released in cinemas as the feature film The Spy with My Face (1965). Also in 1965, she starred in the Glory Guys, a dramatic representation of Custer's Little Big horn disaster, based on the novel The Dice of God by Hoffman Birney. Filmed by Levy-Gardner-Laven and released by United Artists, it stars Tom Tryon, Harve Presnell, Senta Berger, James Caan, and Michael Anderson. Jr.Berger and Verhoeven started their own film production company in 1965, and married in 1966. Berger continued to develop her European career in France and Italy. \n In 1966, Berger co-starred with Kirk Douglas in the film Cast a Giant Shadow. Berger played the role of Magda, a soldier in the Israeli army during the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war (1948). Also in 1966, the British film Our Man in Marrakesh, called Bang, Bang, You're Dead in the U.S., was released, starring Senta Berger opposite Tony Randall. In The Quiller Memorandum, a third film of hers released in 1966, she played opposite Max von Sydow and George Segal in the role of a German schoolteacher involved in neo-Nazi activity. In 1967, Berger acted in the pilot film for the Robert Wagner television series It Takes a Thief, which aired on American television network ABC on 9 January 1968. She reprised her role in the series in October 1969, in an episode in which her character was killed off.\n In 1970, Berger starred for the first time in a film produced by her own company and directed by her husband. Other internationally successful films made by their joint production company included, amongst others, Die wei\u00dfe Rose (1982), The Nasty Girl (Das schreckliche M\u00e4dchen, 1990) and Mutters Courage (1995). In 1971 Berger took part in the media campaign \"We've had abortions!\" launched by German feminist Alice Schwarzer with a cover story in the Stern political magazine. In 1972, she also campaigned for Willy Brandt's Social Democratic Party. \n Following the birth of her first son, Berger soon returned to theatre work. She played at the Burgtheater in Vienna, at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg and at the Schiller Theater in Berlin. Between 1974 and 1982, she played the \"Buhlschaft\" in the play Jedermann at the Salzburg Festival with Curd J\u00fcrgens and Maximilian Schell. She also acted alongside Schell and James Coburn in a supporting role in the acclaimed war film Cross of Iron (1977). In 1977, she was head of the jury at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival.[2] 21 years later, she was part of the jury at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival.[3]\n In 1985\u201386, Berger started a comeback in front of German-speaking audiences in the TV serial Kir Royal. (In the 1980s, Berger was found to have been admired by Scottish drifter Arthur Richard Jackson who attempted to murder American actress Theresa Saldana in 1982.) Further serial hits followed, like Die schnelle Gerdi (\"The fast Gerdi\", 1989\u20132002), where she played a taxi driver, and since 2002 the long-running crime series Unter Verdacht (\"Under suspicion\"). In the same year, she also started a career as a singer of chansons. From 2003 to 2010, Berger was president of the German Film Academy, which seeks to advance the new generation of actors and actresses in Germany and Europe. Since 2005, the Academy assigns the annual German Film Awards or Lola Awards.\n 2005 saw her in the film, Einmal so wie ich will (\"Once according to my will\"), as a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage who finds love on holiday, but turns her back on the relationship. In 2016, she played one of the leading roles in the film Welcome to Germany, directed by her son Simon. The film grossed more than US$20 million, making it the most successful German picture of the year.[4]\n In the spring of 2006, Berger's autobiography was published in Germany: Ich habe ja gewu\u00dft, da\u00df ich fliegen kann (\"I Knew That I Could Fly\"). Among her memories of Hollywood are a less-than-subtle attempt by Darryl Zanuck to get her on his casting couch, and of all the shallow people she met in Hollywood.\n Berger married German film director Michael Verhoeven in 1966; their sons are actor-director Simon Verhoeven (born 1972) and actor Luca Verhoeven (born 1979).\n", " Jourgnac (Occitan: Jurnhac) is a commune in the Haute-Vienne department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in west-central France.\n The river Briance forms part of the commune's northern border.\n Inhabitants are known as Jourgnacois.\n \n", " Shepherds of the Night (Portuguese: Os Pastores da Noite) is a Brazilian novel. It was written by Jorge Amado in 1964 and published in English in 1967.\n Shepherds of the Night is really three long, interrelated short stories, sharing many of the same characters as well as bringing in characters from earlier novels by Amado. The three stories concern the marriage of a playboy to a former prostitute; a Christening where the apparent godparents are actually stand-ins for the African gods in Bahia's syncretic religious culture; and the appropriation of land by the poor and their battles with the government to stay on the land. Amado tells all three  with love of the people he is describing.[1]\n The second part of the novel, Ogum's Compadre, was adapted for a 1995 TV special on the Brazilian TV channel, Rede Globo, after which it was published as a book in its own right. In December 2002, Globo TV ran a four-episode TV version of Shepherds of the Night.[2] The novel had earlier been adapted for film in 1975 by the French director Marcel Camus, appearing as Otalia de Bahia.\n \n", " Dixie is a locality in the Shire of Cook, Queensland, Australia.[1]  The locality contains the source of both the Morehead River and Alice River.\n The Dixie pastoral station is within the locality.[2] It was purchased by the Queensland Government in August 2012.

John had three siblings, of which two survived (a younger brother Jonathan (1744\u20131806) and one other): the third died at young age (Jonathan, the eldest). John and the younger brother Jonathan are often confused in literature and publications. While John worked for a long time in Amsterdam, Jonathan worked n Rotterdam, both in the same line of work.[1]\n John studied with the prominent London instrument maker James Champneys and when Champney moved to Amsterdam[2] in December 1768 Cuthbertson joined him. On 1 September 1768 John  had married Champney's daughter Jane. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, but only the daughter, Jane Cuthberson, survived.[1]\n In 1782 Cuthbertson published a book in Dutch called Algemeene Eigenschappen van Electriciteit, onderrichting van de Werktuigen en het nemen van proeven in dezelve (free translation: \"General characteristics of electricity, education on the tools and the performing of tests in those\") and also organized public lectures, both to disseminate the knowledge about electricity, in his opinion very poor in the Netherlands. The book was quite popular in the Netherlands, and lead him to publish another two volumes with even more possible experiments.[3] In all his publications Cuthbertson seems to concentrate on the glass plate generators and not on the cylindrical ones, possibly because he was involved in the production of the glass plate generators.\n In 1783\u20131784 he used the suggestions of Martinus van Marum, who also had a history of designing electrostatic generators and who had already been in touch with Cuthbertson, in 1774 and 1781, to build the (at that time) largest glass plate electrostatic generator in existence for the Teylers Tweede Genootschap of the Teylers Stichting. It had  disks with a diameter of 1.65\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) and was connected to a battery of Leyden jars to store the  charge produced. With this machine a 61\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft) spark could be produced of, which comes down to roughly 330.000 Volt. Van Marum believed that with larger machines, currents and charges more  scientific progress could be made. The machine was based on a smaller model produced by Jonathan Cuthbertson shortly before, but with some significant changes, such as  glass poles instead of wooden ones. Based on empirical studies Cuthbertson made changes to the scaled-up model. Finally the machine was installed in December 1784 and he received the sum of 3000 guilders for it.[3]\n Sometime between 1793 and 1796 he returned to England, living in Poland Street in London (contrary to his brother Jonathan who remained in Rotterdam), probably due to the political unrest in the Dutch Republic. Here he continued his business and produced a number of smaller (simplified) electrostatic generators \u2013 a design that would be produced until the 1920s.[4] He also worked on electrometers, for which he invented a new design, air pumps and wrote scientific papers. \n In 1807 Cuthbertson published Practical Electricity and Galvanism.[5] This book was partly intended to encourage the sale of scientific instruments for home or school experiments and partly to explain the medical uses of electricity. The home experiments are described as \u2018easy and pleasing to the young practitioner\u2019.The use of static electrical charges and low intensity electrical currents on the human body, known as galvanism, was often used both to treat mental illness and to revive people after drowning or lightning strikes. Almost all conditions, including gout, fever, hydrocephalus, blindness, deafness and genitor-urinary infections were supposed to be treatable by the application of electricity.[5]\n For Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia he  contributed articles about electricity, but the topics are not known. He died in 1821 and was buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly.[1]\n", " KONE Oyj (Finnish pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8kone]; officially typeset as KONE), founded in 1910 and headquartered in Espoo near Helsinki, Finland, is an international engineering and service company employing some 55,000 personnel across 60 countries worldwide. In addition, KONE builds and services autowalks[2][3], automatic doors and gates, escalators and elevators. The company provides local service for builders, developers, building owners, designers and architects in 1,000 offices in over 50 countries.[citation needed]\n Since 1924, KONE has been owned by one of Finland's wealthiest families, the Herlin family. After Harald Herlin purchased the company in 1924, he served as its Chairman until 1941. Afterwards, his son, Heikki H. Herlin, took over his father's post from 1941\u20131987. Control of the company was then handed down to his son, Pekka Herlin, which he retained from 1987\u20132003. The current Chairman of KONE's Board of Directors from 2003 onwards is Antti Herlin, the son of Pekka Herlin.\n In the Finnish language Kone means \"machine\" or \"device\".\n KONE (then known as Osakeyhti\u00f6 Kone Aktiebolag) was founded in 1910 as a subsidiary of Gottfr. Str\u00f6mberg Oy. Str\u00f6mberg's licence to import Graham Brothers elevators was transferred to the new company. KONE sold just a few units before terminating the licensing agreement in 1917. KONE, then a company with only 50 employees, started to make and install its own elevators in 1918. Six years later, in 1924, entrepreneur Harald Herlin bought KONE from Str\u00f6mberg and became the new chairman of the company's Board of Directors. His son, Heikki H. Herlin, joined the company and was appointed technical director in 1928. His office was located in a former margarine factory on Haapaniemi Street in Helsinki that KONE had bought and converted into an elevator production facility the previous year. Heikki H. Herlin took over as KONE's president in 1932. KONE's first foreign subsidiary \u2013 AB Kone Hissar of Sweden \u2013 was established in 1957.\n After World War II, KONE was called upon by the Finnish government to contribute elevators, electric hoists and cranes to the war reparations being paid to the Soviet Union. This program forced KONE to expand its capacity, rationalize production processes and learn to meet demanding manufacturing schedules. In the 1950s KONE introduced its first group controls, automatic doors and hydraulic elevators. Heikki H. Herlin turned over the president's duties in 1964 to his son, Pekka, who had served as administrative director since 1958.\n KONE opened a purpose-built elevator factory in 1966 in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, Finland. The following year KONE was listed on the Helsinki Exchanges and started its international expansion through the acquisition of Sweden's Asea-Graham and its Norwegian and Danish affiliates. Numerous acquisitions followed during the 1970s and 1980s with only the most significant being listed here. The acquisitions of companies larger and older than KONE itself has been seen to have brought KONE respectability and lifted the company to a position of market prominence. Eventually KONE further expanded its business scope. The company became one of the world's largest hoist and crane manufacturers as well as a producer of high-tech electronic hospital and laboratory equipment.\n In 1981 KONE entered the American elevator market with the acquisition of New York City based Armor Elevator Company, which it continued to operate independently as a wholly owned subsidiary.[4] The company acquired Navire Cargo Gear in 1982 and International MacGregor, makers of shipboard cargo access equipment. Wood-handling systems and equipment for pulp and paper mills, hydraulic piping systems, mining equipment and conveyors, and specialized steel components were manufactured at KONE's steel foundry. In 1987, after 60 years as a member of KONE's board of directors and 46 as its chairman, Heikki H. Herlin retired. Prevented by Finnish law from serving simultaneously as president and board chairman, Pekka Herlin ceded the presidency to Matti Matinpalo, the first non-Herlin to occupy the position in 55 years, and continued as Chairman of the Board.\n In 1990, KONE sold its shipboard cargo handling business in 1993, as well as its crane (Konecranes), wood handling and piping systems businesses in 1994, and finally the steel foundry and electronic medical instruments divisions in 1995. Only its elevators, escalators, and automatic door branches remained. KONE acquired the Montgomery Elevator Company of the U.S. in 1994. Soon afterwards, the KONE Corporation purchased a majority of the outstanding shares of O&K Rolltreppen GmbH of Germany, a supplier of escalators and autowalks. In 1998 the company made a $29 million (US) investment in the construction of an elevator and escalator factory in Kunshan, China.\n In 1996, Antti Herlin, the great-grandson of the company's founder, was appointed KONE CEO and deputy chairman of the board of the company that he had now inherited. The company introduced new technology such as the KONE EcoDisc hoisting machine and the KONE MonoSpace elevator technology concept in 1996. KONE was one of the first to introduce machine-room-less (MRL) construction in elevators. KONE's MRL designs significantly reduced the size of elevator machinery and its lift mechanism by using permanent-magnet electric motors (PMM). The use of these mechanisms enabled all of the elevator's equipment and its inner workings to be confined to the space above the elevator shaft, known as the hoistway overhead, instead of needing an entire room dedicated to machinery. At the beginning of the 21st Century, due to the apparent benefits of KONE's pioneering elevator systems, rival companies[which?] began competitively marketing machine-room-less elevators of their own.\n KONEs chairman of the board, Pekka Herlin, died on April 4, 2003 after a long illness. Antti Herlin was subsequently appointed the new chairman of the board in June 2003. Matti Alahuhta, a former Executive Vice President  at Nokia Corporation, previously serving as the President of Nokia Mobile Phones, was later chosen to fill Herlin's vacant position as the acting President of the KONE Corporation. He held the position since 2005, and officially became the firm's President and CEO in 2006. In April 2014, Alahuhta stepped down and KONE's CFO at the time, Henrik Ehrnrooth was appointed Alahuhta's successor.\n In 2000, KONE sold off the American factory in Winfield, KS to Wittur. This was done despite repeated assurances by KONE management to its employees that the factory was not for sale.\n In 2002, KONE acquired Partek, a Finnish industrial engineering company with net sales equal to KONE's. Partek's business areas specialized in container handling, load handling, forest machinery and tractors. The tractors were manufactured under the Valtra brand. The KONE Materials Handling division thus comprised these Partek business areas.\n In 2003, KONE decided to concentrate on Container Handling and Load Handling and the tractor and forest machine businesses were sold.  The Valtra tractor business was sold to AGCO, a worldwide agricultural manufacturer. As the structure of KONE Materials Handling had changed significantly, the name KONE Cargotec was introduced in January 2004. Its business areas were Kalmar (container handling) and HIAB (load handling).\n At the end of 2004, KONE Cargotec acquired MacGREGOR, a global marine cargo-flow service provider.\n In August 2004 the KONE Board of Directors presented a plan to split the company into two separately listed companies on the Helsinki Stock Exchanges in June, 2005. One company would comprise KONE's existing elevator, escalator & building door service business and continue to operate under the name KONE Corporation. The other company would comprise KONE Cargotec\u2019s business area and operate under the name Cargotec Corporation. The Extraordinary Shareholders\u2019 Meeting in December 2004 approved the Demerger Plan. The demerger was completed in June 2005.\n In September 2007 it was announced that KONE is proposing to lease several floors of a new riverfront tower to be built on Bass Street Landing, which is part of the Moline Riverfront.[5]\n Also in 2007, it was announced KONE had received part of what was then the largest fine ever handed out by the EU Commission for local anti-competitive practices in the elevator and escalator markets in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands relating to time prior to mid-2004 (the commission stated that it could only prove its case back to 1995, though evidence allegedly suggested the abuse had started much earlier[citation needed]). Competitors ThyssenKrupp, Schindler Group, Otis Elevator Co. and Mitsubishi Elevator Europe were also given similar fines.[citation needed] KONE has appealed against the size of the fine, currently 142 million EUR. In total, the industry received 1 billion EUR fine for cartel activity across Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.[6]\n Finally, in 2007, KONE announced that they would stop production of hydraulic elevators, replacing them with the EcoSpace MRL elevators, due to the hydraulic elevators' inefficient energy consumption, contamination concerns regarding the use of hydraulic oil and buried cylinders, and other environmental concerns.[citation needed] Therefore, KONE has become the first major brand elevator company to make only traction elevators.[7]\n In June 2013 the company launched a new high-rise elevator technology, called 'KONE UltraRope', which enables future elevator travel heights of up to one kilometer. The product is light due to its carbon-fiber tape core and a high-friction coating. Because of these qualities, elevator energy consumption in high-rise buildings can be cut significantly.[8] Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia (with a height of 1,000 meters) which opens in 2020 will feature KONE UltraRope. The elevator in Jeddah Tower will be a height of 660 meters.[9]\n One additional benefit of UltraRope is that it has a higher resonance frequency than steel cable. This reduces the cable's sway in tall buildings and can minimize damage from the cable to itself and to the elevator shaft.[9]\n The 'KONE EcoDisc motor', used for hoisting, reduces the amount of energy lost as heat and circulates air through the motor reducing heat. The motor control system and brakes make the elevator ride quiet and the design frees up space. It is typically installed as an MRL (Motor-Room-Less) motor that is placed at the top of an elevator shaft. The fastest speed that Kone make the EcoDisc (as an MRL motor) is 3.0 m/s. However, for a faster speed (e.g. 4 m/s) it requires the machine to be installed in a machine room.[10]\n The 'KONE Access Turnstiles', used for the fast and efficient movement for the flow of people. These are part of the 'People Flow' technology family by KONE. This system has the option to have the 'KONE Monitoring System' which allows you to watch and track the turnstiles and elevator systems.\n The 'KONE Polaris Elevator and Destination Dispatch System', allows for a fast and efficient ride from floor to floor in a building. The system uses the 'Destination Dispatch System' which uses a touch screen panel/terminal that shows the floor numbers and when the floor is selected, it calls the nearest elevator to the floor you called the elevator from and will take you to your floor with minor to no stops on your ride to your floor. This technology is part of the 'People Flow' family. The system also allows for the turnstiles to work together with the elevators so when you swipe your access card on the turnstile, it calls the nearest elevator. There is also an app for the elevator system that allows you to call and type in your destination from your mobile device reducing wait time. The name for the elevator model that uses the 'Destination Dispatch System' is the KONE Polaris. This system has the option to have the 'KONE Monitoring System' which allows you to watch and track the turnstiles and elevator systems.\n The 'KONE MonoSpace' for low- to mid-rise buildings is the world\u2019s first machine-room-less elevator.[10]\nThe 'KONE EcoSpace' elevator is a machine-room-less traction elevator designed for low-rise buildings from 2 to 15 stories as an energy-efficient alternative to hydraulic elevators, and can fit in an existing hydraulic elevator hoistway.  It is produced in a 150 feet per minute (0.76\u00a0m/s) speed, 200 feet per minute (1.0\u00a0m/s) and 350 feet per minute (1.8\u00a0m/s) variants.[11]\nThe 'KONE MiniSpace' elevator with a small machine room is often used in high-rise buildings.[10]\n In 2017 Kone announced a new cooperation with IBM allowing them to collect information from lifts. By analysing the information from hundreds of thousands of lifts, the company can identify warning signs of problems that need to be addressed. This means an engineer can be sent out before the problem actually arises, and he or she can also carry the correct spare needed for that exact lift. [12]\n 'People Flow' is a registered trademark of KONE Corporation.[13]\n The European Union (EU) gave a fine of 992m euros ($1.3bn; \u00a3666.8m) on four lift and escalator manufacturers for price-fixing between 1995 and 2004.

They are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th-century founder of the Wahhabi sect of Islam which is today dominant in Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, the family is second in prestige only to the Saudi royal family, the Al Saud, with whom they formed a power-sharing arrangement nearly 300 years ago. The arrangement, which persists to this day, is based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash-Sheikh's authority in religious matters and the Al ash-Sheikh supporting the Al Saud's political authority.\n Although the Al ash-Sheikh's domination of the religious establishment has diminished in recent decades, they still hold most of the important religious posts in Saudi Arabia, and are closely linked to the Al Saud by a high degree of intermarriage. Because of the Al ash Sheikh's religious-moral authority, the arrangement between the two families remains crucial in maintaining the Saudi royal family's legitimacy to rule the country. Sheikh Abdulaziz Bin Salman Bin Abdurahman Bin Eshaq is the most known Al ash-Sheikh member.\n The Arabic name Al ash-Sheikh (\u0622\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u062e) (which is transliterated in a number of ways) translates into English as family of the Sheikh [1] or House of the Sheikh.[2] The word Al, in conjunction with the name of an ancestor, means family of or House of.[3] The term ash-Sheikh refers to the Islamic religious reformer Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the family's ancestor.[4] He was known as the Sheikh,[5] a term of respect for a noted elder, teacher or religious leader.[6]\n The Al ash-Sheikh are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th century founder of the Wahhabi sect which is today dominant in Saudi Arabia.[4] Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in the Nejd. He became influenced by the teachings of Ibn Taymiya, a medieval jurist of the Hanbali school of jurisprudence. As a consequence, he began to preach a simple, puritanical form of Islam that warned against what he believed were religious innovations and critical of the moral laxity he claimed to see in his contemporaries. He attracted support, and his followers became known as Muwahhidun (translated in English as unitarians) because of his emphasis on the oneness of God. Outside Arabia they became known as Wahhabis.[7]\n In the 1740s, he moved to Diriyah in Nejd, where Muhammad ibn Saud, founder of the Al Saud dynasty, was the local ruler. Muhammad ibn Saud decided to support Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's cause,[8] and the combination of the religious zeal inspired by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's teachings and the Al Saud's military and political leadership initiated a period of conquest and expansion.[7] Most of central Arabia and the Hejaz was brought under the Al Saud's rule in what became known as the \"First Saudi State\".[9] The religious establishment, led by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and his family, benefitted from the expansion in an unprecedented manner, enjoying prestige and influence and sharing the treasury with the Al Saud.[10] After his death in 1791, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's legacy was carried on by his many descendants, who continued to hold positions of religious authority.[11]\n Muhammad ibn Saud and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab had concluded a formal agreement in 1744: according to one source, Muhammad ibn Saud had declared when they first met,\n \"This oasis is yours, do not fear your enemies. By the name of God, if all Nejd was summoned to throw you out, we will never agree to expel you.\" Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab replied, \"You are the settlement's chief and wise man. I want you to grant me an oath that you will struggle with me against the unbelievers. In return you will be imam, leader of the Muslim community and I will be leader in religious matters.\"[12]\n Ibn Saud accordingly gave his oath.[12] The descendants of Muhammad ibn Saud, the Al Saud, continued to be the political leaders of the Saudi state in central Arabia through the 19th and into the 20th centuries, and eventually created the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.[9] The descendants of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, on the other hand, have historically led the ulema, the body of Islamic religious leaders and scholars,[13] and dominated the Saudi state's clerical institutions.[14]\n The agreement between Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Muhammad ibn Saud of 1744 became a \"mutual support pact\" and power-sharing arrangement between the Al Saud and the Al ash-Sheikh, which has remained in place for nearly 300 years.[15][16][17][18] The pact between the two families, which continues to this day,[citation needed] is based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash-Sheikh's authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating the Wahhabi doctrine. In return, the Al ash-Sheikh support the Al Saud's political authority [19] thereby using its religious-moral authority to legitimize the royal family's rule.[20] In fact, each legitimizes the other.[citation needed]This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today.[21]\n Following Ibn Abd al-Wahhab\u2019s death, his son, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad Abd al-Wahhab, became leader of the Saudi religious establishment.[22] He endorsed further Al Saud expansion and wrote a number of tracts against Shia belief.[11]\n By the early 19th century, the Saudi conquests had attracted the hostile attentions of the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman forces from Egypt were sent to Arabia in 1811 and, by 1818, had destroyed the Al Saud's state.[23] The defeat of the Al Saud was also a disaster for the Al ash-Sheikh. The Ottomans executed many of the family in 1818[10] including Sulayman ibn Abd Allah,[20] a grandson of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and an influential author of treatises.[22] A whole branch of the family was exiled to Egypt and never returned.[20] This had a major impact on the Saudi religious establishment and left it with no important sources of religious authority for most of the nineteenth century.[10]\n Nevertheless, the family survived in Nejd. When the Al Saud re-established themselves with a much smaller so-called \"Second Saudi State\" from 1824,[9] Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan and, subsequently, Abd al-Latif ibn Abd al-Rahman, both descendants of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, became the leaders of the Saudi religious establishment.[22] However, the destruction of the first Saudi state and the exile or execution of most of the Al ash-Sheikh religious scholars of significance in 1818 meant that the religious establishment lost much of its prestige, influence and material wealth: their eminence in the 18th century was in sharp contrast with their decline in the 19th century.[10]\n For much of the rest of the century, the Al Saud struggled for control of central Arabia with their rivals, the Al Rashid of Ha'il. Eventually, they were defeated in 1891; the Saudi state was again destroyed and the Al Saud went into exile.[9] The ulema was led, at the time, by another descendant of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, Abd Allah bin Abd al-Latif. Rather than going into exile after the defeat, he decided to side with the Al-Rashid and moved to Ha'il, indicating that preservation of the Wahhabi cause took precedence over the family compact with the Al Saud.[20] But the Al Saud returned from exile in 1902 under the leadership of Abdul Aziz Al Saud (later Saudi Arabia's first King) and re-established the Saudi state around Riyadh.[9] Abd Allah bin Abd al-Latif then changed sides again and re-joined the Al Saud, a change of heart which was accepted by Abdul Aziz.[20]\n On the eve of Abdul Aziz's return from exile, the religious establishment had limited authority and influence after the decline in its fortunes of the 19th century.[10] However, he recognized that he could use them to legitimize and help consolidate any conquests he made.[13][24] He therefore cemented the relationship with the Al ash-Sheikh by preferential treatment and matrimonial links,[13] for example, by marrying the daughter of Abd Allah bin Abd al-Latif.[20] With the support of the Al ash-Sheikh and the other Wahhabi ulema, Abdul Aziz went on to conquer the rest of the territory that was to become Saudi Arabia and declared the formation of the new kingdom in 1932. Even after his conquests were complete, Abdul Aziz continued to favor the ulema and especially the Al ash-Sheikh. Their support remained essential for the legitimization of his regime and the process of integration of the conquered territories through religion, education and law. The Al ash-Sheikh were given prestige, privileges, influence and key positions in the government.[13]\n On the other hand, the alliance between Al ash-Sheikh and the House of Saud or more specifically Abdul Aziz was not free from tensions. Some of the Nejdi ulema, particularly those who were under the protection of other Wahhabi rulers, supported Abdul Aziz\u2019s enemies. However, in the end, most of the Nejdi ulema agreed to recognize his authority on condition that, at least temporarily, his father Abd al-Rahman would carry the title of imam. The difficulties arose in relations between Abdul Aziz and the Wahhabi ulema after the establishment of the Kingdom because Abdul Aziz was not considered by them sufficiently religious. Furthermore, Abdul Aziz had not taken up jihad to expand Wahhabi influence. He also maintained relations with the British authorities in the Persian Gulf region.[25]\n The Al ash-Sheikh's position as leader of the ulema is significant because of the central role of religion in Saudi society. It has been said that Islam is more than a religion, it is a way of life in Saudi Arabia, and, as a result, the influence of the ulema is all-pervasive.[26] Specifically, Saudi Arabia is almost unique in giving the ulema a direct involvement in government,[27] the only other example being Iran.[14] Not only is the succession to the throne subject to the approval of the ulema,[28] but so are all new laws (royal decrees).[27] The ulema have also been a key influence in major government decisions,[18] have a significant role in the judicial and education systems[29] and a monopoly of authority in the sphere of religious and social morals.[30]\n Believed to number several hundred individuals currently,[14] the Al ash-Sheikh has continued to produce religious leaders who have exercised great influence on government decision-making.[7] The Al ash-Sheikh ulema have dominated key state institutions such as the Senior Council of Ulema and the Higher Council of Qadis (Judges). Traditionally the most senior religious office, the Grand Mufti, was filled by a member of the family,[14] and, in fact, there has only ever been one Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia who was not an Al ash-Sheikh.[31] Other members of the family serve in important military and civilian capacities, as well as serving as judges and other religious figures.[7]\n However, the Al ash-Sheikh's domination of the ulema has diminished somewhat in recent decades.[7] This is in part because an increase in the number of students in the seminaries has led to an influx from other families,[14] and the Al ash-Sheikh have not produced offspring in sufficient numbers to maintain a numerical predominance.[20] Furthermore, in 1969, King Faisal abolished the office of Grand Mufti and replaced it with a ministry of justice. The minister appointed was deliberately not an Al ash-Sheikh, although subsequent ministers have been. Members of the family have held other ministerial positions but the family's representation in the cabinet dropped from three to two members in 2003 (the Minister of Justice and Minister of Islamic Affairs)[7] and currently stands at one minister, Saleh bin Abdulaziz Al-ash Sheikh, Minister of Islamic Affairs[32] following King Abdullah's ministerial changes of 2009.[33][34]\n Nevertheless, the Al ash-Sheikh are still Saudi Arabia's leading religious family and second in prestige only to the royal family.[2] The family continues to hold many of the most important religious posts in Saudi Arabia:[30] for example, the current Grand Mufti (the position having been restored in 1993[35]) is a member of the family, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh.[36] The family's position is derived not only from their role in the ulema but also from being closely linked to the Al Saud by a high degree of intermarriage.[30] This began in the eighteenth century and has continued in modern times: King Faisal's mother was Tarfa bint Abdullah,[7] daughter of Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Latif Al ash-Sheikh.[20] The family alliance with the Al ash-Sheikh is still crucial to the Al Saud in maintaining their legitimacy. At the same time, the Al ash-Sheikh remain strong supporters of the continued rule of the Al Saud.[7]\n \n", " The word bespoke (/b\u0259\u02c8spo\u028ak/) has evolved from a verb meaning \"to speak for something\" to its contemporary usage as an adjective that has changed from describing first tailor-made suits and shoes, and later, to anything commissioned to a particular specification (altered or tailored to the customs, tastes, or usage of an individual purchaser), and finally to a general marketing and branding concept implying exclusivity and appealing to snobbery.[1][2][3]\n Bespoke is derived from the verb bespeak, meaning to \"speak for something\".[2] The particular meaning of the verb form is first cited from 1583[3] and given in the Oxford English Dictionary: \"to speak for, to arrange for, engage beforehand: to 'order' (goods).\" The adjective  \"bespoken\" means \"ordered, commissioned, arranged for\" and is first cited from 1607.[4][5]\n According to Collins English Dictionary, the term is generally British English.[2] American English tends to use the word custom instead,[6] as in custom car or custom motorcycle. Nevertheless, bespoke has seen increased usage in American English during the 21st century.[3]\n The word bespoke is most known for its \"centuries-old relationship\" with tailor-made suits,[2] but the Oxford English Dictionary also ties the word to shoemaking in the mid-1800s.[7] Although it is now used as an adjective, it was originally used as the past participle of bespeak.[2] According to a spokesperson for Collins English Dictionary, it later came to mean to discuss, and then to the adjective describing something that was discussed in advance, which is how it came to be associated with tailor-made apparel.[2]  The word was used as an adjective in A Narrative of the Life of Mrs Charlotte Charke, the 1755 autobiography of the actress Charlotte Charke, which refers to The Beaux' Stratagem as \"a bespoke play\".[2]  After that, the adjective was generally associated with men's tailor-made suits.[2]\n Before about the 19th century, most clothing was made to measure, or bespoke, whether made by professional tailors or dressmakers, or as often, at home. The same applied to many other types of goods. With the advent of industrialised ready to wear clothing, bespoke became largely restricted to the top end of the market, and is now normally considerably more expensive, at least in developed countries.\n At some point after that, the word bespoke came to be applied to more than tailoring, although it is unclear exactly when.[7] Mark-Evan Blackman of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York told the Wall Street Journal in 2012 that the \"bespoke proliferation may be tied to young Hollywood types becoming enamored with custom suits about a decade ago\".[7]  The Wall Street Journal article said that \"language purists\" were not happy, while suit makers said the word had been \"bastardized\".[7]\n In 1990, American writer William Safire, questioned in a New York Times article what had become of \"custom, a word fading from our fashion vocabulary in a blizzard of British usage\".[6]  In a play on words, he wrote of the snob appeal[3] of the word: \"To be suitably trendy, bespeak to me of bespoke tailoring.\"[6] Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine wrote that the word was \"gaining in popularity\", meaning \"the opposite of off-the-rack\".[8] In its contemporary usage, it implies exclusivity, and is used as an aid in marketing[1] and branding.[9]  A 2014 India Today article described bespoke as an emerging branding trend that marketers would need to embrace.[9]\n A 2001 google search on \"bespoke and software\" produced 50,000 hits, many not in the UK or the US.[10]  The New York Times quoted an Indian tech director as saying the \"global communications boom\" contributed to a \"superset of English vocabulary\";[10] another business writer explained that software companies in India were accustomed to adapting their language depending on the client, so that switching between bespoke software and custom software was the equivalent of switching between lift and elevator or queue and line.[10]  By 2008, the term was more often used to describe software, database and computer applications than suits, shirts or shoes.[2]\n The BBC News Magazine wrote in 2008 that the word had increasingly been used to describe things other than websites, suits and shoes\u2014like cars and furniture.[2]  Some examples of usage of the word are: \n Deborah Tannen, a Georgetown University linguistics professor, told the New York Times that \"Americans associate it with the British upper class\", adding that the word for Americans tapped into \"our individualism. We want everything made special for us. Even when it comes to salad bars.\"[3] As of 2012, there were 39 applications using the term bespoke at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with half of those having been filed only in the previous 18 months.[7] The Wall Street Journal said that the term had started to proliferate in corporations and among investors a few years before that.[7] A writer in The Independent said that consumers no longer wanted to \"keep up with the Joneses\", but wanted to set themselves apart, saying that the bespoke drive was anti-tradition, and about a desire to be different rather than identify collectively with others.[12]\n Newsweek described the word as \"monstrously distorted, abused and otherwise mangled into near meaninglessness\", saying that anything can now be labeled \"bespoke\".[1]  The same Newsweek writer used the word as a verb to describe ordering a custom-made pair of glasses (\"bespeaking a pair of spectacles\").[1] One French bespoke shirtmaker was said to offer 400 shades of white, to satisfy vendor-customer relationships and desire for custom-made items.[1] The New York Times devoted an article to bespoke cocktails, which they described as \"something devised on the spot to a customer's precise and sometimes peculiar specifications\".[13] In another article, the NYT described bespoke perfumes taking the \"world of personalization to an entirely new level\".[14]\n \nA 2016 New York Times article describes a satirical video about bespoke water and said:[3] \"The B word has become an increasingly common branding lure employed by interior design companies, publishers, surgeons and pornographers. There are bespoke wines, bespoke software, bespoke vacations, bespoke barber shops, bespoke insurance plans, bespoke yoga, bespoke tattoos, even bespoke medical implants.\"[3] The UK Savile Row Bespoke Association has requirements for a garment to use the term bespoke, but those requirements are not followed by some manufacturers.[1]  In 2008, the British Advertising Standards Agency allowed a company, Sartoriani, to use the word bespoke to describe its suits, causing a controversy with the Savile Row tailors who used that term to describe custom, hand-made suits.[2]\n", " \n Michael Joseph Riley (born July 6, 1953) is an American football coach and former player who most recently served as the head coach of the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football. Riley previously served as the football coach at Nebraska from 2015 to 2017.\n Riley has also coached in several professional leagues, serving as head coach of the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1999 to 2001 and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 1987 to 1990.\n Riley is the oldest son of Bud Riley (1925\u20132012), a head coach in the CFL and college football assistant at the University of Idaho and Oregon State.\n Born in Wallace, Idaho, Riley is the eldest of three sons of Bud and Mary (Shumaker) Riley.[1][2][3][4] Bud was from western Alabama, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and had played college football at the University of Idaho in Moscow under head coach Dixie Howell, a hall of famer as a player at Alabama.[1] After graduation, Bud worked for a mining company in Wallace and was asked by town leaders to coach at the high school;[5] Mary was from nearby Mullan, where her parents, Mike and Mary Shumaker, ran a hotel.[3][4] The family of four, now with middle brother Ed, moved from Wallace down to Lewiston in 1959, where Bud was the head coach at Lewiston High School for three seasons.\n They moved up to Moscow in 1962, when Bud became a collegiate assistant coach at his alma mater, the University of Idaho, under new head coach Dee Andros.[6] Youngest brother Pete was born while the family lived in Moscow. After three seasons on the Palouse, Andros was hired at Oregon State in 1965 and Bud joined his first staff in Corvallis and stayed for eight seasons, first as the secondary coach and later as defensive coordinator. Bud went on to become a head coach in the CFL.[7]\n Riley had a peripatetic youth and spent his first 11+ years in northern Idaho, but considers Corvallis his hometown. He arrived in the spring of 1965, near the end of sixth grade, and stayed through high school.[1][7]\n Riley was a hometown hero in Corvallis from his athletic days at Corvallis High School, where he led the Spartans as the starting quarterback to consecutive state title games in 1969 and 1970, both played in Corvallis at OSU's Parker Stadium.[7][8] Corvallis High School had narrowly won the early season matchup in 1969, but came up well short against Medford in the A-1 state championship, 27\u20130.[9]\n They avenged the loss to the Black Tornado the following year in the regular season 28\u201314,[10] and again in the AAA state final, 21\u201310, with left-handed option quarterback Riley throwing two touchdown passes in the second quarter to build a 21\u20133 lead at halftime.[11][12] He completed five of nine passes for 76 yards;[11] prior to the final, Riley had thrown only 41 times in 11 games, with 23 completions (and ten wins).[10] He was a three-sport athlete at CHS, also lettering in basketball and baseball.\n Riley graduated from CHS in 1971 and opted not to play his college football in the Pac-8, but for the Alabama Crimson Tide in the SEC under legendary head coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant.[13][14] He had family connections to the state and school: his father was born and raised in Guin and his uncle, Hayden Riley, was Alabama's assistant athletic director, head baseball coach (1970\u201379), and the former head basketball coach (1960\u201368).[6][15] (Mike's cousin, Major Ogilvie, became a star running back for the Tide in the late 1970s; Ogilvie's mother Peggy was one of Bud Riley's five sisters.)[5][16] In his four seasons at Alabama as a reserve defensive back,[17] the Tide won four Southeastern Conference (SEC) titles and the 1973 UPI (Coaches Poll) national championship, though they lost the 1973 Sugar Bowl to Notre Dame on New Year's Eve. Until 1974, the final Coaches Poll was released before the bowl games.\n Riley began his coaching career immediately after his playing days ended, first as a graduate assistant at California in 1975, and then as a graduate assistant at Whitworth in Spokane, where he received his master's in physical education.\n In 1977, he was hired as the defensive coordinator and secondary coach at Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon. During his stay at Linfield he assisted head coach Ad Rutschman's Wildcats to a six-year record of 52\u20137\u20131, which included five conference titles and an undefeated NAIA Division II championship season in 1982. He became an assistant coach in the Canadian Football League in 1983 with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and was a part of their 1984 Grey Cup championship team.\n Hired at age 33, Riley reportedly became the youngest head coach in CFL history in 1987 at Winnipeg but in fact was three years older than Bud Grant, who was 29 when he was hired as Winnipeg's head coach in January 1957 (Grant had turned 30 by the time he coached his first game that summer). Riley led the Blue Bombers from 1987\u20131990 and won two Grey Cups during his tenure. He also coached the San Antonio Riders of the defunct WLAF. He was intended to stay on as the Riders attempted to transition to the CFL (as the San Antonio Texans) for the 1993 CFL season, but the team folded before it could begin playing as a CFL team.\n Riley returned to the college ranks in 1993 when USC head coach John Robinson offered him the position of offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach; he later became assistant head coach.  The Mesa Tribune named him the league's top assistant coach in 1993 after leading the Trojan offense to record setting numbers.[citation needed]  USC quarterback Rob Johnson set numerous Pac-10 and NCAA records under Riley's tutelage and later became a fourth-round NFL Draft pick. \"He's a player's coach, who gets the most out of you by treating you like normal\", Johnson later said.[18]\n Riley remained at USC through the 1996 season, helping the Trojans to post-season victories in the Freedom, Cotton, and Rose Bowls. USC won an outright league title, shared another, and finished second once.\n Riley was hired as the head coach at Oregon State in 1997 to replace Jerry Pettibone, who had resigned at the end of the 1996 season. Riley's initial contract was a five-year deal at $185,000 per year.[19] In the Beavers first season under Riley, they posted a record of 3\u20138. This was a difficult season for Riley as he attempted to run his NFL-style offense with players recruited by Pettibone to run the wishbone triple-option.[citation needed]  The 1998 season was a big step in the right direction, with the Beavers posting a 5\u20136 record, their best record since 1971. Two of the six losses were by a single point, to Washington and California in back-to-back games late in the season.  This was followed by a last-minute loss to a highly ranked UCLA team.  The 1998 season was capped off by a double-overtime 44\u201341 victory over the rival Oregon Ducks in the Civil War game.\n Although his first stint with the Beavers only lasted two seasons, Riley is considered by many to have laid the foundation for the success of the Beavers in the years to come.[20] The 1999 team, led by Dennis Erickson, posted a 7\u20135 record and earned a trip to the Oahu Bowl, which ended a streak of 28 straight losing seasons.\n In January 1999, Riley left the Beavers to become the head coach of the San Diego Chargers of the NFL, signing a five-year deal at $750,000 per year.[21] Riley coached the Chargers from 1999 to 2001, with a record of 14\u201334. In 2000, the Chargers had their worst season; they went 1\u201315, with their only win on a last-second field goal against the Kansas City Chiefs.  Riley's last game was indicative of his last season, as the Chargers played well, but one poor play turned the tide. The 2001 Chargers ended their 5\u201311 season with a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, after Doug Flutie passed for 377 yards and drove for the tying field goal with 16 seconds remaining, but poor special teams play led to a long Seahawks kick return and subsequently a 54-yard winning field goal.\n Riley was fired as head coach of the Chargers after three seasons[21] and was an assistant coach with the New Orleans Saints in 2002.  He was offered the Alabama job in December 2002 after Dennis Franchione left for Texas A&M.[22] Riley was also under consideration for the UCLA job during that period.[23]\n After spending the 2002 season with the New Orleans Saints, Riley returned to Corvallis to become the head coach at Oregon State in 2003 following Erickson's departure to become the head coach of San Francisco 49ers of the NFL. Riley agreed to a seven-year contract that started at $625,000 per year and increased incrementally to $950,000 in year seven.[24]\n Continuing on their new success, the Beavers won bowl games in 2003 and 2004 before having a down year in 2005.\n After starting the 2006 season 2\u20133, the Beavers went 9\u20134 on the regular season, including an upset of #3 USC in Corvallis. The Beavers completed their impressive season with a win over Missouri in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, ending their season with a 10\u20134 record.\n In 2007, the Beavers again started 2\u20133 and finished 8\u20134 on the regular season, including an upset of #2 Cal in Berkeley. The Beavers finished the year 9\u20134 with a win in the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco over the Maryland Terrapins.\n In 2008, Riley's Beavers knocked off #1-ranked USC 27\u201321 at Reser Stadium.  The Beavers went into the Civil War with a chance to reach the Rose Bowl as Pac-10 champions but were defeated by Oregon, 65\u201338, and instead accepted another invitation to the third place Sun Bowl, where they beat Pittsburgh in a defensive struggle, 3\u20130.\n Though winless in bowl games as a player, Riley has a 6\u20132 NCAA football bowl record as a head coach through the 2013 season, having won the 2003 Las Vegas Bowl, 2004 Insight Bowl, 2006 Sun Bowl, 2007 Emerald Bowl, and 2008 Sun Bowl.  Riley is a combined 8\u20131 in bowl games as a head or assistant coach.  In the 2009 Las Vegas Bowl, the Beavers lost to the BYU Cougars of the Mountain West Conference.\n In Riley's second stint at Oregon State, the Beavers produced four NFL quarterbacks, Sean Mannion, Sean Canfield, Matt Moore, and Derek Anderson.\n Following the 2009 season, Riley was rumored to be up for the USC vacancy created by the resignation of Pete Carroll. Those rumors were put to rest when Riley signed a three-year extension at OSU through the 2019 season.\n During the 2012 season, Riley snatched his 75th career win surpassing Lon Stiner as Oregon State's all-time winningest coach.\n On December 4, 2014, Riley was named head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers.[25] Riley completed his second stint at Oregon State with an 85\u201366 (.563) record in a dozen seasons. His 93 wins overall in 14 seasons at OSU are the most in school history.\n In his first season as head coach at Nebraska, Riley's Cornhuskers completed a 5\u20137 regular season (their first losing season since 2007) with numerous last second losses; notable among these was the Huskers' first game under Riley, wherein they lost to BYU, 33\u201328, on a last-second Hail Mary pass from the Cougars' backup quarterback, Tanner Mangum, to wide receiver Mitch Mathews (a loss which snapped Nebraska's streak of 29 consecutive home opener wins).[26] Despite their losing season, however, the Cornhuskers were still invited to a post-season bowl game due to a lack of enough eligible teams to fill all bowl slots and the team high academic progress rate (APR).[27] The Cornhuskers defeated the UCLA Bruins in the 2015 Foster Farms Bowl, finishing the season 6\u20137.[28] 2016 saw improvement as the team began the season with seven straight wins and reached number 7 in the AP Poll, and finished 9\u20134 overall after losses to Wisconsin, Ohio State, Iowa, and Tennessee in the Music City Bowl. Riley was fired following the 2017 season, after leading the team to a 4\u20138 record, which marked the school's fewest wins since 1961.[29]\n On December 7, 2017, it was announced that Riley would return to Oregon State to be the assistant head coach under newly hired Oregon State head coach Jonathan Smith, who had been both a player (1998) and a graduate assistant coach (2003) during Riley's first and second tenures as head coach at Oregon State.\n In June 2018, Riley was named the head coach of the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football.[30]\n \n Riley played for:\n Riley coached under:\n Assistants/Players under Mike Riley who have become NCAA Division I or NFL coaches:\n # denotes interim head coach\n # denotes interim head coach\n # denotes interim head coach\n", " \n Paul McGuinness (born 17 June 1951) is the main shareholder and founder of Principle Management Limited, a popular music act management company based in Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland. He was the manager of the rock band U2 from 1978 to 2013, and is the current manager of PJ Harvey, and The Rapture. He previously managed Paddy Casey.\n McGuinness was born in a British military hospital at Rinteln, Westphalia in Germany, where his father, Philip McGuinness (a Liverpudlian) was serving with the Royal Air Force. His mother Sheila McGuinness n\u00e9e Lyne, was a schoolteacher from County Kerry, Ireland. There were three children in the family: Paul, Niall and Katy.\n McGuinness received his early formal education in Ireland at the private Jesuit boarding school Clongowes Wood College. From there he went on to Trinity College, Dublin University, where he directed plays and edited the magazine T.C.D. Miscellany,[1] but dropped out.\n Before becoming involved with U2, he worked as a film technician on productions such as John Boorman's Zardoz.[2] For a time, he also managed folk-rock group Spud.[3]\n He was nicknamed by The Prunes as \"The Goose\", according to Bono in the book U2 by U2. Bono said: \"The Prunes came up with a name for Paul. He was The Goose.\"[4]\n McGuinness first met U2 at a Dublin gig on 25 May 1978 where they were supporting the Gamblers[5] and became their manager, having been introduced to the band by Bill Graham, a journalist with Hot Press magazine.[6]\n He founded Principle Management Limited on 29 Mar 1984,[7] the name being chosen because he wanted to be more principled than other managers.[8]\n In 1985, McGuinness commissioned Eamon Dunphy to write the story of U2's early years. The book Unforgettable Fire \u2013 The Story of U2 was published in 1987.\n McGuinness and Bill Whelan set up a music publishing company called McGuinness/Whelan Publishing in the late 1980s.[9]\n In 2002 McGuinness was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Meteor Music Awards at Point Theatre Dublin and U2 won the best Irish Band Award.[10]\n As a result of the cap on artists' tax exemption in Ireland, in June 2006 McGuinness advised U2 to move its song publishing assets to Promogroup in The Netherlands, to minimise their tax burden.[11][12]\n Noted for his business acumen, he has been responsible for U2 3D concert films, U2-branded iPods, sponsorship from BlackBerry and the first ever concert streamed live on YouTube.[13]\n He is regarded as the fifth member of U2, although in an interview with the Irish Press in 1985, when asked if he was the fifth member of U2, he replied \"the fifth member of U2 is in Adam (Clayton)'s trousers\". He is also regarded as one of the most successful managers in the music business.[14]\n McGuinness stepped down as manager of U2 after 34 years on 13 November 2013, with Madonna's manager Guy Oseary succeeding him in 2014.[15]\n He was a founding partner of TV3 (Ireland) and is a director of Ardmore Studios.[16] He is a member of the Phantom FM consortium that in November 2004 secured a broadcasting licence for alternative rock music radio station in the Dublin area and co-founder of the Celtic Heartbeat label, part of Universal Records.[17]\n He became a member of the Arts Council of Ireland on 1 January 1988, having been nominated by Charles Haughey and served until February 2000 when he resigned.[9]\n He is an advocate on behalf of artists, record labels and music publishers.[18] On 28 January 2008, in a speech at the Midem music industry convention in Cannes, McGuinness called on governments to compel ISPs to introduce mandatory \"three strike\" service disconnections to end unauthorised downloading, and specifically accused companies such as Apple, Google, Yahoo!, Oracle, and Facebook of building \"multi billion dollar industries on the back of our content without paying for it\".[19][20]\n McGuinness, alongside Eamon Dunphy and others, was involved in a consortium proposing and backing the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Dublin in the 1990s. The move to Dublin did not happen, with Wimbledon F.C. eventually moving to Milton Keynes.[21]\n McGuinness married Kathy Gilfillan in 1977.[22] They met whilst he was studying at Trinity.

Heathfield is on the borders of Ayr and Prestwick and is located beside the A77 Ayr by-pass.  The Whitletts roundabout in Heathfield is the main roundabout connecting Ayr with other towns and cities. Heathfield has a lot of aviation history especially during World War II where there was an RAF base called RAF Heathfield.\n Heathfield Retail Park, which opened in 1994, is built in the southerly reaches of the site of the RAF station.  This was originally marked by a replica Supermarine Spitfire at the entrance to the park.  The road into the park is named Liberator Drive, in recognition of the large numbers of Consolidated Liberator bombers that were serviced in the area during World War II.  It is the central out of town shopping complex, with outlets including Homebase, PC World, Frankie & Benny's, Subway, and Asda as well as Pizza Hut and KFC. Travelodge hotel is also now open as well as a Holiday Inn.\n Heathfield was once the site of the Burgh Fever Hospital, which was built on the villa system and incorporated a Sanatorium for tuberculosis patients. In later years, renamed Heathfield Hospital, it became the main medical hospital for the town until the new Ayr Hospital was opened. It also had chest disease, dermatology (until 1983) and ophthalmic surgical units.  Much of the hospital has now closed and the majority of its buildings have been demolished.  The remaining buildings have been converted into use as day clinics.

Lord Norwich calls him \"one of the most influential statesmen in Europe.\" \n Maio was born in the first decades of the twelfth century to Leo of Rayza and Kuraza, members of the urban upper class in Bari. Leo is documented as a judge in Bari between 1119 and 1135, as a royal justice from 1141 and as a regalis supra iudex (\"royal superior judge\") or protoiudex (\"first judge\") from 1142 to 1147. He was dead by 1155. The death of Maio's mother, Kuraza, is recorded in the necrology of the cathedral of Salerno as falling on 26 July 1158. The contemporary Liber de regno sicilie, a partisan source, falsely claims that Maio was the son of an oil merchant. In his Chronicle and Annals, Romuald Guarna (died 1181/2), a partisan of the other side, calls Maio \"certainly an eloquent, fully honest and discreet man\" (vir utique facundus, satis providus et discretus).[1]\n Maio is first documented as the royal scriniarius, the official in charge of the archive of the royal court (curia regia), in a royal concession to the monastery of Santa Maria Maddalena di Valle Giosafat in October 1144.[1] Down to February 1148 he continued to witness documents, always as scriniarius, whenever the chancellor, Robert of Selby, was absent. The written record attests that he was constantly present with the court at either Messina or Palermo during this period. In 1149 he was granted the title \"vice-chancellor\" (vicecancellarius), which appears to have been created specifically for him. His new rank probably reflected a change in status, from that of a functionary internal to the chancery to a more clearly defined role in the government. After the death of Robert of Selby he was promoted to head the chancery. He first appears with the title of \"chancellor\" (cancellarius) in May 1152, in an Arabic-language document of the duana regia (or d\u012bw\u0101n al-ma\u2019m\u016br), the office which controlled the royal fisc, concerning a dispute between the monastery of San Giorgio di Triocala and the lord of Calamonaci.[1]\n After the deposition and execution of the admiral Philip of Mahdia (1153), the admiralcy was vacant for a year. Shortly after his coronation (4 April 1154), King William I appointed Maio to the rank of \"admiral of admirals\" (amiratus amiratorum). In June 1154 he subscribed to an official copy of a donation of land and serfs to the monastery of San Nicol\u00f2 del Churchuro from 1149.[2] Between October 1154 and May 1160 Maio's standard title was magnus [great] ammiratus ammiratorum. Although this title, derived from the Arabic amir al-umar\u0101\u2019 (literally \"emir of emirs\"), evolved into a purely military one (c.f. admiral), in Maio's time it was an administrative title. The Arabic writer Ibn al-Ath\u012br, who called Maio a \"sad governor\" for his role in the rebellion against William I, translated his title as vizier.[1]\n Maio was not popular with the baronage and supported the immigration of Western Europeans, Roman Catholics all, to increase the influence of that church, which was his largest supporter (at first). The chiefest of baronial opponent to Maio was, at first, Robert de Bassonville, the count of Loritello and cousin to the king. He resented Maio's rise and his own cousin's royal powers. He joined with a Byzantine army under Michael Palaeologus in 1155 and took Bari. At that time, the king fell ill and remained so from September to Christmas. Maio and Hugh, Archbishop of Palermo, took control of the kingdom in the meanwhile. It was then, with revolt spreading in the peninsula, that insurrection began in the island. A conspiracy formed to overthrow both Maio and the king. Maio refused to panic and the major revolts were soon dead. However, a revolt led by one Bartholomew of Garsiliato took Butera, on Sicily, and proceeded to declare themselves in armed insurrection. The rebels demanded the king remove Maio and the archbishop from his inner circle. William refused. The rebels stirred up riots in the capital of Palermo itself, where the people demanded the release of Count Simon of Policastro, whom Maio had imprisoned without trial. William negotiated himself out of the bind and Maio remained his right-hand man, though Maio's own right-hand, Asclettin, the chancellor, was imprisoned by the king.\n In 1156, it was Maio who was primarily responsible for the Treaty of Benevento which ended hostilities between Sicily and the Holy See and preserved for William the legatine powers granted originally to his father.[3] The newfound alliance with Adrian IV made the Sicilians enemies, inevitably, of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Maio may have even been present at the formation of the Lombard League, as an envoy of William's. Maio's concentration on events to the north, however, proved the downfall of the African possessions of the crown. On 11 January 1160, Mahdia surrendered and Maio received a lot of the blame. His unpopularity peaked, but so did his power.\n His enemies spread rumours that he was aiming to seize the crown, that he had already seized the regalia with the help of Queen Margaret, with whom he was certainly in bed, and that he was even planning the king's assassination: with the help of the pope. Certainly all such allegations were patent nonsense, but a conspiracy arose on the peninsula around one Matthew Bonnellus, who planned to assassinate the admiral himself. Bonnellus was an intimate of Maio, who wished to marry his daughter to him, and therefore well-positioned to strike the undoing blow. While Maio prepared a wedding, Bonnellus prepared an assassination. On 10 November 1160, in the street called Via Coperta, Bonnellus and his conspirators stabbed Maio to death and severely wounded his chief prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Matthew of Ajello. Maio's wife and children were quickly whisked away as a mob descended on his palace. It was a brutal end.\n Maio's influence as a courtier of William was great. His administration is noted primarily for consolidating the centralisation begun under the first two Rogers. Though he neglected the widespread conquests (wrought largely by George of Antioch) of the kingdom, he assured a stability that proved after his death to be very volatile. The King's confidence in him was so great as to result in the nomination of his brother Stephen and his brother-in-law Simon to high posts of captain in Apulia and seneschal. According to his enemy the chronicler \"Hugo Falcandus\" put it:\n Maio wrote an \"Exposition of the Lord's Prayer\" in the scholastic tradition.\n \n", " Griffin Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Oregon.[1]  It is a tributary to Bear Creek.[2]\n Griffin Creek was named in 1852 after Captain B.B.

Four different product lines\u00a0\u2013  the XDCAM\u00a0SD, XDCAM\u00a0HD, XDCAM\u00a0EX and XDCAM\u00a0HD422\u00a0\u2013  differ in types of encoder used, frame size, container type and in recording media.\n None of the later products have made earlier product lines obsolete. Sony maintains that different formats within XDCAM family have been designed to meet different applications and budget constraints.[1]\n The XDCAM range includes cameras and decks which act as drop-in replacements for traditional VTRs allowing XDCAM discs to be used within a traditional videotape-based workflow.  These decks can also serve as random access computer hard drives for easy import of the video data files into non-linear editing systems (NLE) via FireWire (IEEE 1394) and Ethernet.\n In September 2008, JVC announced its alliance with Sony to support the XDCAM EX format.\n In August 2009, Convergent Design began shipping the nanoFlash Portable Recorder, which uses the Sony XDCAM HD422 codec.\n In November 2012, VITEC began shipping the FS-T2001 Portable Recorder, which uses Sony XDCAM HD422 and XDCAM HD codec.\n The XDCAM format uses multiple video compression methods and media container formats.\n Video is recorded with DV, MPEG-2 Part 2 or MPEG-4 compression schemes. DV is used for standard definition video, MPEG-2 is used both for standard and high definition video, while MPEG-4 is used for proxy video.\n Audio is recorded in uncompressed PCM form for all formats except proxy video, which uses A-law compression.\n Equipment that uses Professional Disc as well as XDCAM 4:2:2 on SxS cards as recording media employs MXF container to store digital audio/digital video streams. Tapeless camcorders that record onto solid-state memory cards, use MP4 container for high definition audio/video, and DV-AVI container for DV video. JVC camcorders that use XDCAM EX recording format, are also capable of recording into QuickTime container besides using MP4 container.\n DVCAM uses standard DV encoding, which runs at 25\u00a0Mbit/s, and is compatible with most editing systems. Some camcorders that allow DVCAM recording can record progressive-scan video.\n MPEG IMX allows recording in standard definition, using MPEG-2 encoding at data rate of 30, 40 or 50 megabits per second. Unlike most other MPEG-2 implementations, IMX uses intraframe compression with each frame having the same exact size in bytes to simplify recording onto video tape. Sony claims that at 50\u00a0Mbit/s it offers visual quality that is comparable to Digital Betacam[2] MPEG\u00a0IMX is not supported in the XDCAM\u00a0EX product line.\n MPEG HD is used in all product lines except for XDCAM SD. This format supports multiple frame sizes, frame rates, scanning types and quality modes. Depending on product line or a particular model, not all modes of this format may be available.\n MPEG HD422 doubles the chroma horizontal resolution compared to the previous generations of high-definition video XDCAM formats. To accommodate the improved chroma detail, video bitrate has been increased to 50\u00a0Mbit/s. This format is used only in XDCAM HD422 products.\n MPEG SHD422 XDCAM-SHD422 stands for \"Super HD\" and has been introduced later on to preserve more details. It maintains the 4:2:2 planar chroma sampling as well as the same resolution of MPEG HD422, but it increases the bitrate to 85\u00a0Mbit/s. This format has never become widely used and a very limited set of devices support it.\n Proxy AV is used to record low resolution proxy videos. This format employs MPEG-4 video encoding at 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s (CIF resolution) with 64\u00a0kbit/s (8\u00a0kHz A-law, ISDN-quality) for each audio channel.\n ^ 1 720p @ 19\u00a0Mbit/s is offered by JVC and is equivalent to HDV\u00a0720p\n\nXDCAM-SHD422 has a very limited support, therefore it's not included in the table.\n The Professional Disc was chosen by Sony as its medium for professional non-linear video acquisition for a number of reasons, outlined in their white-paper Why Sony Adopted Professional Disc. This disc is similar to Blu-ray Disc and holds either 23\u00a0GB of data (PFD23, single-layer, rewritable), 50\u00a0GB (PFD50, dual-layer, rewritable), 100\u00a0GB (PFD100TLA, triple-layer, rewritable) or 128\u00a0GB (PFD128QLW, quad-layer, write-once).\n Essentially, the Professional Disc format was deemed to be a suitable, cost effective and easy step forward. The discs are reliable and robust, suitable for field work (something which has previously been a problem with many disc-based systems). Additionally, the cost of media is comparable to existing professional formats.\n In 2008, Sony introduced a new recording medium to their XDCAM range\u00a0\u2013  SxS Pro (pronounced \"S-by-S\"). It is a solid-state memory card implemented as an ExpressCard module. The first camera to use this media was the Sony PMW-EX1 professional video camera.\n In December 2009, Sony introduced the more affordable SxS-1.  This unit is designed to have the same performance as the SxS Pro card however its life expectancy is shorter at an estimated 5 years of life when used every day to the card's full capacity.\n In early 2013, Sony has introduced SxS Pro+ cards.  These have a 1.2\u00a0Gbit/s read and write speed to support the PMW-F55 in storing 4K 60p acquisition.\n Memory Stick cards can be used in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders via the MEAD-MS01 adapter.[4]\n Secure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders via the MEAD-SD01 adapter.[5] JVC camcorders that record in XDCAM EX format use Secure Digital memory cards natively.\n XQD memory cards can be used in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders via the QDA-EX1 ExpressCard adapter.[6]\nXQD memory cards can be used in:\nNIKON D4 - NIKON D4S | NIKON D5 | NIKON D500 | NIKON D850\n", " Ganesha, or 2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-dimethylamphetamine, is a lesser-known psychedelic drug.

The control grid usually consists of a cylindrical screen or helix of fine wire surrounding the cathode, and is surrounded in turn by the anode.  The control grid was invented by Lee De Forest, who in 1906  added a grid to the Fleming valve (thermionic diode) to create the first amplifying vacuum tube, the Audion (triode).\n In a valve, the hot cathode emits negatively charged electrons, which are attracted to and captured by the anode, which is given a positive voltage by a power supply.  The control grid between the cathode and anode functions as a \"gate\" to control the current of electrons reaching the anode.  A more negative voltage on the grid will repel the electrons back toward the cathode so fewer get through to the anode.  A less negative, or positive, voltage on the grid will allow more electrons through, increasing the anode current.  A given change in grid voltage causes a proportional change in plate current, so if a time-varying voltage is applied to the grid, the plate current waveform will be a copy of the applied grid voltage. \n A relatively small variation in voltage on the control grid causes a significantly large variation in anode current.  The presence of a resistor in the anode circuit causes a large variation in voltage to appear at the anode.  The variation in anode voltage can be much larger than the variation in grid voltage which caused it, and thus the tube can amplify, functioning as an amplifier.\n The grid in the first triode valve consisted of a zig-zag piece of wire placed between the filament and the anode.  This quickly evolved into a helix or cylindrical screen of fine wire placed between a single strand filament (or later, a cylindrical cathode) and a cylindrical anode. The grid is usually made of a very thin wire that can resist high temperatures and is not prone to emitting electrons itself.  Molybdenum alloy with a gold plating is frequently used.  It is wound on soft copper sideposts, which are swaged over the grid windings to hold them in place.  A 1950s variation is the frame grid, which winds very fine wire onto a rigid stamped metal frame. This allows the holding of very close tolerances, so the grid can be placed closer to the filament (or cathode).\n By placing the control grid closer to the filament/cathode relative to the anode, a greater amplification results.  This degree of amplification is referred to in valve data sheets as the amplification factor, or \"mu\".  It also results in higher transconductance, which is a measure of the anode current change versus grid voltage change.  The noise figure of a valve is inversely proportional to its transconductance; higher transconductance generally means lower noise figure.  Lower noise can be very important when designing a radio or television receiver.\n A valve can contain more than one control grid.  The hexode contains two such grids, one for a received signal and one for the signal from a local oscillator.  The valve's inherent non-linearity causes not only both original signals to appear in the anode circuit, but also the sum and difference of those signals.  This can be exploited as a frequency-changer in superheterodyne receivers.\n A variation of the control grid is to produce the helix with a variable pitch.  This gives the resultant valve a distinct non-linear characteristic.[1]  This is often exploited in R.F. amplifiers where an alteration of the grid bias changes the mutual conductance and hence the gain of the device.  This variation usually appears in the pentode form of the valve, where it is then called a variable-mu pentode or remote-cutoff pentode.\n One of the principal limitations of the triode valve is that there is considerable capacitance between the grid and the anode (Cag). A phenomenon known as the Miller Effect causes the input capacitance of an amplifier to be the product of Cag and amplification factor of the valve.  This, and the instability of an amplifier with tuned input and output when Cag is large can severely limit the upper operating frequency.  These effects can be overcome by the addition of a screen grid, however in the later years of the tube era, constructional techniques were developed that rendered this 'parasitic capacitance' so low that triodes operating in the upper very high frequency (VHF) bands became possible.  The Mullard EC91 operated at up to 250 MHz. The anode-grid capacitance of the EC91 is quoted in manufacturer's literature as 2.5 pF, which is higher than many other triodes of the era, while many triodes of the 1920s had figures which are strictly comparable, so there was no advance in this area.  However, early screen-grid tetrodes of the 1920s, have Cag of only 1 or 2fF, around a thousand times less. 'Modern' pentodes have comparable values of Cag. Triodes were used in VHF amplifiers in 'grounded-grid' configuration, a circuit arrangement which prevents Miller feedback.\n", " The men's 470 was a sailing event on the Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics program in Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy,[1] in the 470 dinghy Eleven races (last one a medal race) were scheduled and completed. 54 sailors, on 27 boats, from 27 nations competed.

Some historians have speculated that Russkoye Ustye was settled by Pomors in the early 17th century.[1]\n In 1638 Ivan Rebrov reached the Indigirka.[2] In 1636\u201342 Elisei Buza pioneered the overland route to the Indigirka river system. At about the same time, Poznik Ivanov ascended a tributary of the lower Lena, crossed the Verkhoyansk Range to the upper Yana and then crossed the Chersky Range to the Indigirka. In 1642 Mikhail Stadukhin reached the Indigirka overland from the Lena.[2]\n Zashiversk on the Indigirka was an important colonial outpost during the early days of Russian colonization.  It was subsequently abandoned in the 19th century. Other historical settlements, now long abandoned, were Podshiversk and Uyandinskoye Zimov'ye.\n In 1892\u201394 Baron Eduard Von Toll carried out geological surveys in the basin of the Indigirka (among other Far-eastern Siberian rivers) on behalf of the Russian Academy of Sciences. During one year and two days the expedition covered 25,000 kilometres (16,000\u00a0mi), of which 4,200 kilometres (2,600\u00a0mi) were up rivers, carrying out geodesic surveys en route.\n The Indigirka forms a large delta, consisting of a number of streams (each one being labeled on Russian maps as a protoka (river arm)) and islands.

The left (westernmost) arm  is known as the Russko-Ustyinskaya Protoka; the right arm, the Srednyaya Protoka (Russian for the \"Middle Arm\"). Further downstream, the third major arm, the  Kolymskaya Protoka splits off the Srednyaya Protoka as its right (eastern) distributary, thus justifying the \"middle\" moniker for the Srednyaya Protoka.[3]\n While Srednyaya Protoka means the \"Middle Arm\", the names of the main western and eastern arms  indicate their relative location as well. The Kolymskaya Protoka, or Kolymskoye Ustye  is the arm one located on the eastern side, i.e. the \"Kolyma side\" of the delta (the arm closest to the Kolyma, the eastern neighbor of the Indigirka). The Russko-Ustyinskaya Protoka, apparently known earlier as simply Russkoye Ustye [4] is the arm one located on the western side, i.e. the \"Russian side\" of the delta (meaning, the side closest to the (European) Russia). These days the name of the Russko-Ustyinskaya Protoka appears as if it were formed from the name of the old Russian village Russkoye Ustye situated there, but originally the opposite is likely to have been the case, the village being named after the river arm (the Russkoye Ustye) on which it was located.\n Several flat islands are formed by the channels of the delta.

Barry was frequently among the league's leading scorers and after winning his first Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in 1936, he scored the championship winning goal in 1937.  Barry won the Lady Byng Trophy in 1936\u201337 as the NHL's most gentlemanly player and was named to the First All-Star Team.  Following his playing career, Barry coached junior and senior teams in Halifax, Nova Scotia for many years. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1965.\n Barry was born December 8, 1905 in Quebec City, Quebec, but grew up in Montreal and played amateur hockey for various teams in the city where he earned the nickname \"goal-a-game Barry\".[1] Both the Montreal Canadiens and Montreal Maroons passed him over, so Barry signed with the New York Americans in 1927.[2] He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut in 1927\u201328 and scored one goal in nine games for New York.[3] Barry spent the majority of the season in the Canadian-American Hockey League (Can-Am League) with the Philadelphia Arrows. He remained in the Can-Am League for the 1928\u201329 season where he was a member of the New Haven Eagles.[4] Barry led the league in both goals, 19, and points, 29.[5] Barry battled Art Chapman for the scoring title, which he ultimately won on the final day of the season.[6]\n The Boston Bruins claimed Barry from the Americans in the Intra-League Draft in May 1929, and from that point he remained in the NHL. He missed only two games total in the following ten seasons.[4] Barry recorded 18 goals and 33 points in 1929\u201330 for a Bruins team that set an NHL record with 38 wins in a 44-game season.[7] Barry scored three playoff goals to help Boston eliminate the Maroons in the semi-final, but Boston was defeated by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Final.[4]  Barry rapidly developed into one of Boston's top offensive threats; he averaged 23 goals per season in his six years with the team.[1] The Bruins named him team captain in 1933,[8] led the team in goals for three consecutive seasons between 1931 and 1934 with 21, 24 and 27 respectively, and was the team's leading point scorer three times between 1932 and 1935.[9] He was also among the league scoring leaders and finished seventh in the NHL with 37 points in 1932\u201333, fourth with 39 points in 1933\u201334 and eighth with 40 in 1934\u201335.[10]\n A disputed goal by Barry was the flashpoint in the first ever NHL forfeit on March 14, 1933.  Barry scored a controversial overtime goal for Boston in a home game versus the Chicago Black Hawks.  (At the time, NHL overtime for regular-season play consisted of a full 10-minute period.) An enraged Chicago coach, Tommy Gorman, punched referee Bill Stewart.  Stewart summoned the police to remove Gorman from the visitors' bench.  The Black Hawk players refused to continue the game without their coach.  The game was forfeited to Boston shortly thereafter. \n Barry was involved in a major trade prior to the 1935\u201336 season.[1] The Bruins sent Barry and Art Giroux to the Detroit Red Wings on June 30, 1935, in exchange for Cooney Weiland and Walt Buswell.[11]  With Detroit, Barry centred a high-scoring line with Herbie Lewis and Larry Aurie as his wings.[4] Barry finished third in the NHL with 21 goals and second with 40 points.[10] In the opening game of the playoffs, Barry played in the longest game in NHL history, a 1\u20130 victory over the Montreal Maroons that required six overtime periods to determine a winner.[12]\n \u2014Barry describing what it felt like to play in the longest game in NHL history.[5]\n The Red Wings defeated the Maroons in the playoff semi-final before defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1936 Stanley Cup Final to claim Detroit's first NHL championship.  Barry scored a goal in the clinching game, a 3\u20132 Detroit victory.[13]  Barry was a central figure for Detroit as the Red Wings repeated as champions in 1936\u201337. He finished third in regular season scoring with 44 points,[10] then led all players in goals (4), assists (7) and points (11) in the playoffs.[5]  In the clinching victory over the New York Rangers in the 1937 Stanley Cup Final, Barry scored twice \u2013 including the Cup-clinching goal \u2013 and added an assist in a 3\u20130 victory.[14] He was named to the NHL's First All-Star Team at centre and won the Lady Byng Trophy as the league's most gentlemanly player.[5]\n After a 1937\u201338 season in which Barry scored only nine goals, he returned to the NHL leader board by finishing fourth with 41 points in 1938\u201339.[10] The Red Wings spent several months attempting to trade the 34-year-old Barry to the Canadiens. When Montreal feigned a lack of interest, Detroit eventually granted him his outright release and made him a free agent shortly before the 1939\u201340 season began.  Two days after his release, the Canadiens signed Barry to a contract.[15] His tenure with Montreal was short-lived, however. After scoring only four goals and 14 points in 30 games,[3] Montreal released Barry from his contract.[6] He signed on with the Pittsburgh Hornets of the International-American Hockey League (IAHL) to complete the year.[16] Barry played his final season of professional hockey in 1940\u201341 in the dual role of player-coach for the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association (AHA).[5]\n Barry retired with 195 goals and 387 points in 509 NHL games.[3] He was regarded as one of the league's best playmakers during his career and possessed a good scoring touch in-close around the net.[1] Barry was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1965.[17]\n Barry coached the Millers for one addition season in 1941\u201342.[18] He then settled with his wive and three surviving children (one died shortly after childbirth[19] in Halifax, Nova Scotia.[20]  Barry managed a grocery store in nearby Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[1]  Remaining active in hockey, Barry coached the St. Mary's Juniors in Halifax for many years throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s.[21] He also coached the Halifax Crescents of the Maritime Senior League for a time.[22]  Barry's junior team won Maritime championships and reached the eastern final of the 1947 Memorial Cup.[4] Hoping to raise the quality of competition for his team, Barry convinced teams from as far away as Montreal to play in Halifax and exposed his players to professional scouts.  In recognition of his contributions, Barry was an original inductee of the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame when it opened in 1964.[23] Barry died of a heart attack at his home on August 20, 1969.[20]\n", " Judith Ann Reisman (/\u02c8ri\u02d0sm\u0259n/; born April 11, 1935) is an American conservative author, best known for her criticism and condemnation of the work and legacy of Alfred Kinsey. She has been referred to as the \"founder of the modern anti-Kinsey movement\".[1] Her commentary is currently featured by the conservative WorldNetDaily and the Christian Salvo (magazine).[2][3] She holds a Ph.D. in Communications from Case Western Reserve University, and is a visiting Professor of Law at Liberty University.[4]\n Investigative journalist Max Blumenthal has documented how Reisman's daughter's molestation set Reisman on the path of researching Kinsey's activities. Following the sexual assault, the accused boy and his family slipped out of the country, while her daughter lapsed into a deep depression. Fifteen years later, she died from a brain aneurysm, which Reisman suspected was linked to the earlier trauma.[5]\n Over the following years, her accusations against Kinsey became increasingly serious. She said that he was a fraud who had employed and relied on pedophiles for his research,[6] and she went on to claim that Kinsey himself had sexually abused children. This allegation drew a response from Kinsey biographer James H. Jones, who wrote that unless new evidence to the contrary becomes available, Reisman's claims that Kinsey may have witnessed or personally participated in child molestation under the guise of scientific research all had to be considered groundless.[7]\n Due to such ideas, she was \"ostracized by mainstream academia\".[5][8][9]\n Prior to the release of the 2004 film Kinsey, Reisman and Laura Schlessinger attempted to place an advertisement \"alleging Kinsey was a pervert and a pedophile\".[10]\n The Southern Poverty Law Center has called Reisman a \"conspiracy theorist\" and a promoter of \"sexual pseudoscience\" in regards to her views on Kinsey.[11] John Bancroft stated:\n Reisman's campaign against Kinsey was described by Morton Hunt (1999) as follows: \"To use smear tactics, methods of intimidation, and political trickery to achieve what one considers a moral end, is to live by the principle that the end justifies the means.\" (P. 209.)[12] Diederik F. Janssen has reviewed her book Sexual Sabotage: How One Mad Scientist Unleashed a Plague of Corruption and Contagion on America from a postmodern perspective.[13] First, he notes about her book: \"This takes the unseemly shape of a paranoid sermon on American decency held together by acerbic ad hominems, a tapestry of slippery slope arguments, a string of unwholesome linkages (\"Nazi serial pedophiles\"), and a litany of medieval, Victorian, and McCarthyian diagnostics (\"plague,\" \"sexual psychopaths,\" \"sexual deviancy,\" \"perversions\").\"[13] Then he considers that Reisman plays truth games precisely because Kinsey had invited sexologists to play truth games.[13] Janssen sees her fault in \"exactly the scientific cover-up of moral dilemmas she accuses her nemesis Kinsey of. To maximize this argument: what needs criticism, on behalf of children, is scientism, not moralism.\"[13] He notes that if taboos need \"scientific (medical) approval, their days may be numbered.\"[13]\n In 1983, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) was headed by social conservatives, including  Alfred S. Regnery in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). Reisman had given a talk on a Washington, D.C. radio program and on CNN's Crossfire about the \"connections between sex education, sex educators, and the pornography industry\" which was heard by a member of the DOJ, and Reisman was asked to discuss her views in person, which \"struck a common chord ... especially those opposed to sex education in the schools.\" She was then invited to apply for a grant, which was approved without competition for the amount of $798,531 (though later reduced to $734,371), to undertake a \"study at American University to determine whether Playboy, Hustler and other more explicit materials are linked to violence by juveniles.\"[6][14][15] The allocation came under criticism as the grant was approved despite a staff memo from Pamela Swain, a director of research, evaluation and program development, in which she claimed that the study could be accomplished for $60,000.[14]\n By 1986, Reisman concluded her investigation of \"372 issues of Playboy, 184 issues of Penthouse and 125 issues of Hustler\" that found \"2,016 cartoons that included children apparently under the age of 17 and 3,988 other pictures, photographs and drawings that depict infants or youths,\" the details of which were collected into \"a three-volume report running to 1,600 pages\" titled \"Images of Children, Crime and Violence in Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler.\"[16] The report drew contemporary criticism in regards to its cost and quality.[15][17] Sex crime researcher Avedon Carol commented that the report was a \"scientific disaster, riddled with researcher bias and baseless assumptions.\"[18] The American University (AU), where Reisman's study had been academically based, refused to publish the completed work, citing concerns by an independent academic auditor. Criminologist Robert Figlio of the University of Pennsylvania[19] stated \"The term child used in the aggregate sense in this report is so inclusive and general as to be meaningless.\"[16] Loretta Haroian stated about the report \"vigilantism: paranoid, pseudoscientific hyperbole with a thinly veiled, hidden agenda.\"[11]\n Author Susan Trento chronicled additional complexities surrounding the episode. Initially, Reisman was targeted by some as a proxy to attack Regnery. The nature of Reisman's grant work and the concurrent Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, which would author the Meese Report in 1986, caused anxiety in the pornography industry. Fears began to come to fruition when 7-Eleven stores stopped selling Playboy and Penthouse, in part citing Reisman's work. Trento writes that the public relations firm headed by Robert Keith Gray was hired by Playboy and Penthouse \"to discredit Meese's Pornography Commission\" specifically as well as others that threatened their business, presumably including Reisman.[6][20] \"Whatever the merits of her research,\" Trento wrote, when support from the OJJDP was needed most, its leadership backed away from Reisman leaving her project to fail and leaving Reisman feeling \"bitter\" and \"helpless\" after \"spending years developing an expertise and doing what she thought was an excellent job in the public interest.\"[6]\n In 2017, Reisman became involved in a group called Investigating YouTube's[21] examination of societal degeneracy pertaining to pedophilia in video content. Specifically, Dr. Reisman voiced her concern about the disturbing content in YouTube videos targeted at children, involving suggestive imagery and violence while using popular children's figures such as Frozen's Elsa and Spider-Man.[22]\n When Playboy and Penthouse printed nude photos of Madonna in 1985, Reisman warned that because of the entertainer's idolization by youth, their publication would destigmatize and \"encourage voluntary display by youngsters,\" leading to an increase in child pornography.[23]\n Reisman has claimed that the homosexuals employ recruitment techniques that rival those of the United States Marine Corps.[1] Reisman cited \"a clear avenue for the recruitment of children\" by homosexuals in her public support of Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992).[24] In 1994, Reisman spoke at a conference of Christian leaders in Colorado Springs, saying that homosexual \"recruitment is loud; it is clear; it is everywhere.\" She estimated the homosexual population at the time to be 1-2%, but she predicted at least 20% (and possibly over 30%) \"of the young population will be moving into homosexual activity\" as a result of recruitment.[5]\n Reisman has postulated a physical mechanism to account for the dangers she ascribes to pornography: when viewed, an addictive mixture of chemicals (such as glucose[25][26] sic) which she has dubbed \"erototoxins\", floods the brain, causing harmful influences to it. Reisman hopes that MRI studies will prove porn-induced physical brain damage and predicts lawsuits against publishers and distributors of pornography similar to those against Big Tobacco, which resulted in the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Further, if pornography can \"subvert cognition\", then \"these toxic media should be legally outlawed, as is all other toxic waste, and eliminated from our societal structure.\" Finally, individuals who have suffered brain damage from \"pornography are no longer expressing 'free speech' and, for their own good, shouldn't be protected under the First Amendment.\"[27][28][29][30][31]\n Endorphins are substances produced by the brain as a result of various things including sexual arousal, physical exercise, strong pain, laughter, etc. They cause pleasurable sensations and are somewhat addictive; drugs like morphine attach to the same receptors as endorphins. However, endorphins do not fit Reisman's definition of erototoxins, as many things cause them to be released, not only pornography.\n The 2002-2011 Proceedings of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences state about her public statements about erototoxins: \"facts stood in the way of her opinion and testimony.\"[32]\n Reisman has said that she believes that a homosexual movement in Germany gave rise to the Nazi Party and the Holocaust. She endorses The Pink Swastika, which elaborates on this view and has compared modern youth groups for homosexuals to the Hitler Youth.[1]\n Though a few early participants in Nazi organizations were indeed homosexual, Nazism actually became infamous for its homophobia\u2014so much so that this came to be included on the list of reasons for executions in concentration camps, a detail Reisman tends to gloss over and/or dismiss outright.\n During the 1990 obscenity trial of Dennis Barrie, then director of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, for displaying controversial photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, Reisman was called as the only expert witness for the prosecution.[33] In the previous year, Reisman had authored an editorial in The Washington Times entitled \"Promoting Child Abuse as Art\"[34] which \"accused Mapplethorpe of being both a Nazi and a child molester\".[35][36] The defense argued that she was not qualified as an art expert, but the judge allowed her to testify as a rebuttal witness.[33] Among her credentials as a media specialist she listed: \"preparation of educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian Institution as well as having worked for Scholastic magazine, created audio-visual segments for television's Captain Kangaroo show, and did research for Attorney General Edwin Meese's commission on pornography and for the conservative American Family Association.\"[33][37] During her testimony, Reisman did not discuss the sexually explicit content of Mapplethorpe's work, but rather she argued that the five photographs were not works of art because they either did not display a human face, or, in the case of Self-Portrait, the face \"... displayed no discernible emotion\" and absent emotion, the placement of the photographs in a museum implied that the activities displayed were appropriate.[38][39] During cross-examination by the defense on her views of homosexuality, Reisman testified that \"anal sodomy is traumatically dysfunctional and is definitely associated with AIDS.\"[39] She also claimed that the pictures of nude children legitimized pedophilia.[38] The defense emphasized that Reisman's experience with art was limited to her work as a songwriter.[38]\n Barrie and the Center were acquitted of all charges by the jury.[40]\n In 1991, Reisman, with an attorney from the Rutherford Institute, sued the Kinsey Institute, its then director June Reinisch and Indiana University for defamation as well as intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress regarding alleged attempts to censor her book Kinsey, Sex and Fraud.[41] The case was ultimately dismissed with prejudice in 1994.[11]\n", " \n The social vole (Microtus socialis) is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is found in China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Syria, Turkey, and Ukraine.\n \n", " \n Peter Joseph Cleary (18 September 1950 \u2013 15 April 1976) was an Irish republican and a leading member of the 1st Battalion of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s South Armagh Brigade. He held the rank of Staff Officer and served as the unit's treasurer. He was implicated by journalist and author Joe Tiernan in the killing of Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) corporal and alleged Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) member Robert McConnell.[1] Ten days after McConnell's killing, Cleary was shot dead by the Special Air Service (SAS) after being arrested at the home of his girlfriend outside Forkhill. He was widely believed[citation needed] to have been the mastermind behind the Kingsmill massacre, when ten Ulster Protestant workers were taken from their work van and shot dead by the roadside. He was the first person in Northern Ireland to be killed by the SAS, following the admission of their deployment there in January 1976.[2] According to the SAS, he was shot after attempting to take the rifle from the officer who was guarding him in a bid to escape.[3]\n Cleary was born on 18 September 1950 in Northern Ireland, the second eldest of the 13 children of Hugh and Mary Cleary.[4] He was brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, and according to author Tony Geraghty he was originally from Newry;[3] although David McKittrick's book Lost Lives states he had lived in Magee Terrace, Belleeks, County Armagh.[5] At some stage after the Troubles broke out in 1968, Cleary joined the 1st Battalion of the South Armagh Brigade of the Provisional IRA. He served as the unit's treasurer and held the rank of Staff Officer.  He made his living as a scrap metal dealer.[3]\n Author and journalist Joe Tiernan claims that Cleary was part of the three-man IRA unit that ambushed and killed part-time Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) corporal Robert McConnell in the garden of his home at Tullyvallen, near Newtownhamilton. Cleary and his team hid in the bushes and when McConnell appeared, Cleary shot him twice in the head, killing him. McConnell had allegedly been a member of both the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade and the Glenanne gang, both of which carried out sectarian killings.[6] In 1993 Yorkshire Television aired a programme, The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, which implicated McConnell in the 1974 Dublin car bombings. The narrator also claimed McConnell was an Intelligence Corps agent with links to Captain Robert Nairac.[7] RUC Special Patrol Group officer John Weir affirmed this in an affidavit and named McConnell as the perpetrator of a series of sectarian attacks. He also alleged that McConnell had been set up by the Intelligence Corps who passed on confidential information about McConnell to the IRA, through Nairac, in an attempt to infiltrate the organisation.  Upon receiving this information, the IRA ordered the execution of McConnell.[6]\n Cleary was on the run, living in the Republic of Ireland; however on 15 April 1976 (ten days after the McConnell shooting), he returned secretly to Northern Ireland where he was promptly arrested at the home of his pregnant girlfriend outside Forkhill.[8] He was seized by an SAS team who had been watching the house from observation positions as part of a week-long surveillance job and taken to a field to await transport by a military helicopter, as travelling by road was deemed too risky for British military personnel.[9] On the previous 31 March at 9:30am a group of Scots soldiers and SAS men had raided the Cleary family home in Magee Terrace, Belleeks.[10] In their account of Cleary's killing, the SAS claimed that while four of the men were holding lanterns guiding the aircraft to a landing in the dark, the young officer (who was allegedly on his maiden SAS operation) left to guard Cleary was forced to shoot him twice after the latter made an attempt to wrest the officer's rifle from him in a bid to escape.  Cleary, although gravely wounded, was still alive, and an NCO then took the rifle from the officer who had shot him, and killed him with a final, third shot to \"end his misery\". Before returning the weapon to its owner, he wiped away his fingerprints.  An inquest into the killing was held nine months later. A witness who had been inside the house from where Cleary was arrested testified that immediately after the soldiers had taken Cleary away he heard somebody crying over the ditch, then a single shot.[3] Three of the SAS team attended the inquest, a statement was read on behalf of the officer (using the nom de Guerre \"Soldier A\") who first shot Cleary. The statement defended his actions by describing Cleary as \"heavier and stronger\" than him, as well as a \"notorious killer\"; \"Soldier A\" went on to say\n as he lurched at me my instincts as an SAS soldier took over. I released the safety catch on my weapon and started shooting. There was no chance to warn Cleary. I went on firing until the danger to me was over.[11]\n An open verdict was returned by the inquest.\n Author Mike Ryan claimed in his book Secret Operations of the SAS that Cleary had actually managed to escape and was shot by the pursuing soldiers who had ordered him to stop as he tried to make his way to the Republic of Ireland border.[12] Cleary received three shots to the chest.[13]\n Peter Cleary was the first person killed by the SAS since they were deployed to Northern Ireland in full force in January 1976 by order of British Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the wake of the Kingsmill massacre; although there had been an SAS presence in the province prior to then, having had a proxy intelligence role through the 14th Intelligence Company, and their sub-unit 4 Field Survey Troop.[14]\n John Weir claimed in his affidavit that Robert Nairac's cover had been blown when he was recognised at the SAS shooting of Peter Cleary, the implication being that Nairac had been present when the incident took place.[6]\n On 17 April 1976 the Cork Examiner described Cleary's killing as \"an act of utter folly\".[15]\n", " Ambrosius Franz Friedrich Christian Adalbert von Virmont (also von Viermund; 15 December 1682[1] \u2013 19 November 1744) was a German nobleman and Imperial Count of Virmont and Bretzenheim.\n Ambrosius Franz was the only son of Ambrosius Adrian, Freiherr von Viermund zu Neersen (1640\u20131688) and Johanna Margaretha von Spee (died 1712).[2] He baptised in December 1682.[3] His family seat was Schloss Neersen in today's Willich in the Lower Rhine region. He was still a minor when his father died in 1688 and he inherited his father's titles and fiefs as Freiherr von Viermund and Lord of Neersen.[4] He reached adulthood in 1699.[5]\n In 1705 he married Eleonore Magdalena Wilhelmina (1687\u20131727), daughter of Ernest William, Count of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Steinfurt.[6][7] This marriage gave him access to the higher ranks of the European nobility. In respect of the merits of his uncle General Damian Hugo von Virmont during the Great Turkish War, Emperor Joseph I on 8 September 1706 raised both him and his uncle to Imperial Counts.[8] Following the fashion of the time his family name was altered from von Viermund to the frenchified von Virmont. His wife Eleonore died in 1727.[6][8] Soon after his two children Maria Isabella Augusta Ernestine (1706\u20131728) and Joseph Damian Max (1707\u20131730) also died.[6]\n 1731 he was appointed to be judge at the Imperial Chamber Court (Reichskammergericht) in Wetzlar and became one of the highest judges of the Holy Roman Empire.[6][9] After Count Alexander IV. von Velen had died in 1733 the Archbishop and Prince-elector of Cologne Clemens August of Bavaria enfeoffed him with the Lordship of Bretzenheim. This Lordship was an Imperial Estate providing him a seat and vote both in the Upper Rhenish Circle and in the Bench of Counts of Westphalia. On 22 August 1738 he was even elected to be the catholic director of the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Comital College. He furtheron styled himself as \"Reichsgraf von und zu Virmont und Bretzenheim\".[10][5]\n 1741 in Vienna he married his second wife Maria Elisabeth von Nesselrode, daughter of the Royal-Hungarian Field Marshal Johann Hermann Franz von Nesselrode (died 1751) and his cousin Maria Ludovica von Virmont.[6] Maria Elisabeth had been handmaiden of dowager empress Wilhelmine Amalia and was considerably younger than Ambrosius Franz.[6] During all his life Ambrosius Franz sought to regain the estates and possessions of his family in and around the town of Vierm\u00fcnden in Hesse. 1742 he applied to be enfeoffed with the Lordship of Vierm\u00fcnden at the court of landgrave Frederick I and after being repeatedly refused filed a lawsuit at the Aulic Council in Vienna in this matter. His death in 1744 forestalled a final decision.\n On 19 November 1744 after a masked ball in Wetzlar Ambrosius Franz abruptly died.[6][11] Since the children from his first marriage had all died early and the second marriage had remained childless, the House of Viermund became extinct with his death. On 21 November 1744, he was buried in Wetzlar Cathedral. After a long legal dispute, his widow finally in 1763 returned the Lordship of Neersen, including Schloss Neersen, to the Electorate of Cologne for a payment of 110,000 florins. The Lordhship of Bretzenheim was given by the Archbishop of Cologne to Ignaz Felix Freiherr von Roll zu Bernau.[12]\n By 1744 he held the following titles:[10]\n", " In information theory and coding theory, linear programming decoding (LP decoding) is a decoding method which uses concepts from linear programming (LP) theory to solve decoding problems. This approach was first used by Jon Feldman et al.[1] They showed how the LP can be used to decodes block codes.\n The basic idea behind LP decoding is to first represent the maximum likelihood decoding of a linear code as an integer linear program, and then relax the integrality constraints on the variables into linear inequalities.\n \n", " Mary Cecil Hay (10 January 1839 \u2013 24 July 1886) was a British novelist. Her work was often serialised and appeared in periodicals and weeklies in the UK, America and Australia.\n Mary Hay born in Shrewsbury to  clockmaker Thomas William Hay (1791\u20131856) and Cecilia Carbin (1798\u20131888).[2]  There were six children in the family, three boys and three girls, all baptised in a non-conformist independent church.[3]  The eldest boy, Arthur Kenneth (1824\u20131839), committed suicide at the age of fifteen.[4]  The middle son, Walter Cecil Hay FRAM (1828\u20131905),[5] became an organist and music teacher,[6] whilst the youngest son, Thomas William (1836\u20131873), followed his father into the clock-making business.  Mary and her two sisters, Francis Ann (1830\u20131884) and Susan Elizabeth (1840\u20131908) remained unmarried and continued to live at home with their mother.  Mary's father died in 1856 aged sixty-five and her mother took control of the business, despite financial difficulties,[7] passing it to her son Thomas in 1872.  He became the third generation of clock-makers in the family.  After this date Mary, her two sisters and her mother moved to Chiswick and later took a house in West Sussex.[8][9]\n One of Hay's novels, For Her Dear Sake, is part set near the Lizard in Cornwall, a short distance from the Grade and Ruan parishes where she was staying with the family of Rev. Frederick Christian Jackson.  Jackson was a competent amateur artist and sold pictures to fund his church, and in 1880 he managed to persuade Madame Modjeska to put on a staging of Romeo and Juliet in the vicarage gardens to raise funds for the church organ.\n Although Hay lived at home with her mother and two sisters, she would have come into contact with people involved in the arts and music through her brother, Walter Cecil Hay, and his family. Walter was a concert master, a composer, the Diocesan Inspector of Choirs for the Rural Deanery of Shrewsbury, organist at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury and a music tutor.[10][11]  One of his best known pupils was composer Edward German.  In 1855 Walter married Emily Henshaw (1828-1903), whose father, Thomas Northage Henshaw (1799-1871) was the teacher of Writing and Accidence at Shrewsbury School from 1847 to 1870.[12]  Emily was a good amateur artist and painted several studies of the old buildings in Shrewsbury, many of which can be seen on the Darwin Country museum and library web site.[13]  Emily and Walter's granddaughter was artist Margaret Dovaston.  Mary Cecil Hay's knowledge of the arts was reflected in reviews that she wrote for the Royal Academy Exhibition and the Grosvenor Gallery in 1880.[14][15]\n One memory of a particular event in Mary Hay's youth must have stayed with her for many years. In 1857 when she was 17 her brother, Walter, organised a summer fete in Shrewsbury that included music from  Monsieur Jullien.  The event was in a location referred to as the Isle of Poplars, and access to it was via a temporarily pontoon bridge constructed across the River Seven for the event. In the evening, as the visitors started to return home across the bridge, it gave way and ten people, including women and children, were drowned. At the inquest the mayor of Shrewsbury told the jury that he had given Walter Hay permission for the pontoon, only on condition that the construction was placed in the hands of a suitably qualified person.  Hay was exonerated by the jury because it was deemed that he had given the contract for the construction of the bridge to such a person. However, the weight of people using the thoroughfare had been underestimated by the contractor and crowd control had been inadequate.[16]\n In addition to the suicide of her oldest brother in 1839, Mary's youngest brother, Thomas William, had setbacks in his life and died at the early age of 37 in Boston, America.[17] He had also been declared bankrupt in England in 1867, possibly due to the problems with his mother's clock/watch making business.[18] One of the trustees in these proceedings had the unusual middle name of Bickerton and Mary Hay named one of her villains, Bickerton Slimp, in her novel Old Myddelton's Money.\n Hay's novels usually had a common structure. They were often set in Cornwall where Hay used to visit, but they also had locations near Birmingham and Liverpool. The story is usually set at an upper class residence and also includes urban locations. The lower class heroine finally gets to marry the higher class and elder hero, but there are usually some legal problem over maybe a will and another secondary character comes to an early and unusual death.[9] Hay was from a Protestant background and her novel's support the role of the upper classes and they frequently have a moral sub-plot. Foreigners and members of the nouveaux riche are thought, at best, to be suspicious and are usually bad characters. The novels are noted for their witty and punny dialogue which have been compared to that of the Welsh writer Rhoda Broughton.[9]\n However, it would be unfair to stereotype all of Hay's storytelling in this way.  She wrote many works outside of this genre. One example is Under the Will, a novella of about 21,000 words told from the view point of three people. It begins as a romance and develops into an adventure.  The story starts with Hope Wynne telling of her childhood and her growing up with two boys, one of whom, Charlie, eventually becomes her betrothed. Charlie and his friend find out about a scheme to work land in Venezuela.  They sign up for this and leave England with others, believing they have paid for land that will make their fortune. Hope Wynne is written out of the story at this point.  When they eventually arrive at their destination, in a remote region of Venezuela, they discover that it has been a scam, and many die of disease. The two friends eventually make it out of the wilderness, discovering on the way that Charlie has been left a large fortune that must be claimed within one year. The outcome has a twist that involves a deception, and the money being used to mount a rescue mission for those still stranded in Venezuela.[19]\n Hay's writing were initially published as serials in magazines like the Family Herald, at first under the pseudonyms of Mark Hardcastle, Markham Howard or Sidney Howard.  For a period she used the name M. Cecil Hay, shortening her middle name which was actually Cecilia.[20]  Many of her works were published as collections of short stories or as a three volume novel. Novels like The Squires Legacy were published in 60 different issues of the Family Herald in 1875 and this was followed by a three volume novel the same year. The following year the novel was published in one volume, but by another different publisher.[9]\n Her most popular story was Old Myddelton's Money, which was first published in 1875 and it was still in print in 1914.[21]  Old Myddelton of the title was a very wealthy unmarried man, murdered (supposedly) by his nephew Gabriel, who was tried and convicted of the murder, but escaped dressed as a woman. This may seem improbable, but the episode was lifted from the real story of William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, who escaped from the Tower of London the night before his execution in 1716 dressed as a woman.  The murdered man's fortune passed to Myddelton's sister, Lady Lawrence, who is childless, and it is supposed that she will leave the money to various of her in-laws.  A stranger called Royston Keith arrives in town and takes interest in the affairs of the family, much to the concern of a villainous lawyer who hopes to be one of the beneficiaries.   The stranger and another potential beneficiary, Honor Craven, form an attraction, and it goes on from there with all of the loose ends being sorted in the final chapters.[22]\n Hay died in a house called Bay Trees, East Preston on 24 July 1886[23] after a fifteen-year career followed by a long illness. According to probate records her personal estate was worth \u00a3272; her sister Susan Elizabeth was named as executor.[24] She was buried in Highgate Cemetery.[21][25]  Her sister, Francis, had died two years previous, in East Preston on 3 July 1884, aged 50.[26] Their mother died in 1888 and the surviving sister, Susan Elizabeth, passed away in 1908, leaving her estate to be administered by her niece, Amy Isabel Dovaston, mother of painter Margaret Dovaston.[27]\n Several of Hay's books have been scanned and may be viewed on the Internet Archive and HathiTrust\u2019s digital library. In addition to her novels, Hay wrote poems, novellas and short stories, published both in Britain and abroad, occasionally under different titles.   She was a prolific writer, demonstrated by the list of her work detailed below, which is almost certainly not comprehensive.  Some works such as The Arrandel Motto were initially published under her pseudonym of Mark Hardcastle.  This book was later reprinted and re-titled The Arundel Motto with Mary Cecil Hay named as the author.  When she started to use the name M. Cecil Hay for titles such as Victor Vanquished and Kate's Engagement some reviewers mistakenly believed that the author was a man.[29]  A widely published obituary of Hay said of her:\n Miss Hay, was one of the most active and industrious women of letters. Her pen was never idle and her novels pleased a large circle of readers. She was one of the brightest and most sympathetic of women, with a keen kind eye. One of her little peculiarities was that she did not like to be called Miss. She requested even her friends to address their letters simply to Mary Cecil Hay.

The character is played by Kyle MacLachlan. Orson is introduced in the final episodes of the second season of the series, and becomes the main mystery of the third season.[5] MacLachlan left the main cast in season six, but made guest appearances until the eighth and final season.\n The character of Orson Hodge was originally planned as a romantic interest for Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), according to executive producer Tom Spezialy, until Cherry decided to pair Orson with Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross).[5][6] For the third season's mystery, series creator Marc Cherry wanted to incorporate more of the series' regular characters rather than bringing in various new ones, like they had done in the second season with Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and her family. They developed the Orson plot line around the \"idea that one of our women marries a guy who has dark secrets and possibly a violent streak.\" Cherry opined: \"I thought there was something exciting about that, but real and relatable.\"[7] Greenstein commented that the writers worked backwards from the second season's cliffhangers to develop the Orson storyline, forsaking the original material that had been developed earlier.[8] The cast responded positively to the new material for the season.[7]\n When Orson was introduced toward the end of the second season, he was originally to be a con artist. A character portrayed by Julie White appeared in the second season finale and would have been Orson's accomplice, but the entire storyline was discarded in favor of the mysterious disappearance of Orson's wife and White's character was not seen or mentioned again.[9][10] MacLachlan commented that his character is \"desperate to make this relationship with Bree work. Anything that tries to knock that apart becomes a threat.\"[7] Cherry called Orson Bree's perfect match, but added that their similarities \"will ultimately prove to be the downfall of the relationship.\"[7]\n Orson Hodge, born on June 28, 1964 (as seen on hospital records in \"The Miracle Song\"), grew up in a very religious household.\n When he was sixteen, his father Edwin had an affair. When the truth came out, it caused a scandal at their church and he became an alcoholic. One day his mother, Gloria, asked Orson to stay with him, saying she had to visit a sick friend, but Orson later left because he had plans to go out with his friends. When he returned, his father had apparently committed suicide. Orson would later spend time in a mental hospital for depression, as Gloria blamed him for his father's death. He later became a dentist.\n Orson married his girlfriend, Alma, when she got pregnant. Unfortunately Alma miscarried and Orson never came to love her, having an affair with French flight attendant Monique Pollier instead. When Alma found out, she left and punished Orson by faking her own death. However, as there was no body and no evidence, no charges were brought. Alma's friend, Carolyn Bigsby, however, was constantly accusing him of killing her. Free, he tried beginning a new life with Monique but found her dead. Orson's mother said it was an accident but she murdered Monique to punish Orson for cheating on Alma. He had to hide the body when Mike Delfino, whom Monique had called, came to do some plumbing. Gloria convinced a reluctant Orson to aid her in covering up the murder. Gloria and Orson buried Monique at the country club after Gloria removed Monique's teeth to prevent identification. All of this would come back to haunt him.\n Orson met Susan in season 02 episode no.19  at the movies and helped her make Mike jealous. He then met Bree at the mental hospital. When Bree saw Orson visiting an old friend, the two were attracted to each other. Their relationship was furthered when Orson helped Bree escape from the hospital to be with her daughter, Danielle. However, when Mike saw Orson for a dental exam and recognized him, Orson ran Mike over in an attempt to cover his tracks. He then visited Bree, bringing her flowers and she invited him into her house.\n After six months of dating and of being in a serious relationship, Orson proposed to Bree, who accepted. Mike, though alive, no longer worried Orson as he had retrograde amnesia. Unfortunately for them, Carolyn returned. They married after Bree asked him if he had killed his first wife.\n They were about to go on their honeymoon but Bree cancelled at the last minute when she saw her son, Andrew, on TV and went after him. He rejected her but Orson persuaded him to come back, making him realize Bree would hurt herself just as much as his mother otherwise.\n Orson told Bree that Carolyn's husband had an affair which ultimately led to Carolyn taking people hostage in the supermarket (including Edie, Julie, Lynette, Austin and Nora) and killing Nora.[11]\n Bree tried reuniting Orson with his family by finding his mother. Orson claimed she was senile but this wasn't true and backfired when Gloria tried driving Bree away by revealing his affair with Monique but Mike Delfino's arrest stopped her suspicion that Orson murdered Monique. Susan, however, did suspect Orson. Gloria then brought Alma back, proving she wasn't dead. She wanted Orson back and even tried getting pregnant after drugging and raping him and faked suicide so he would visit. Bree sided with her husband, leading Gloria to sabotage her ladder, putting her in hospital. Andrew, thinking Orson was responsible, threatened him with meeting \"bad Andrew\" and Mike, now out of jail, began remembering the night Monique died. He confronted Orson on the hospital roof and accidentally pushed him from the roof.\n Bree and Susan reconciled after her accident and Orson used Alma's well-timed death, her suicide letter and his mother's stroke to implicate them in Monique Pollier's murder, clearing Mike's name. Orson visited his mother and banished her from his life,[12] and he and Bree went on honeymoon, dropping Danielle off at a convent to avoid scandal as she was pregnant. When they returned, it was revealed that Bree was faking her pregnancy and planned to raise Danielle's child as their own.[13]\n Faking a pregnancy proved difficult as people kept touching Bree's belly and even had to invent a story to explain why Bree had not noticed a fork enter her belly. They also had to deal with genuinely pregnant Susan who wanted the name of Bree's ob-gyn and Danielle's troubles, even endangering the baby's life by rollerblading.[14] Orson wanted to tell people the truth but continued pretending Bree was pregnant when she told him that this baby was her second chance at parenting. They appeared to be successful as only Phyllis Van de Kamp and Adam Mayfair found out and both agreed to keep the secret. Phyllis, however, plotted to get back at Bree by taking Danielle to stay and raise the child with her, using Danielle's craving for fun.[15]\n Danielle gave birth to a baby boy on Halloween. After a tearful goodbye, Danielle gave her baby to her mother. Bree and Orson named him Benjamin. When Bree wanted to get Benjamin circumcised, Orson opposed it, due to bad memories of his own circumcision. However, Bree did it behind Orson's back. Orson was angry when he found out but forgave Bree and let it go, though it was clear that he was unhappy.\n After a tornado, Orson, Bree and Benjamin moved in with Susan and Orson began sleepwalking. When Julie came in late one night, she found Orson and he said \"I'm sorry I ran you over, Mike\". Julie later told Mike and he forgave Orson but Susan and Bree couldn't, leading Bree to kick him out. He stayed briefly with Edie Britt before moving into the Fairview Towers apartment complex. Orson attempted to get Bree to forgive him but she refused, telling Orson that the only way their marriage can be saved is if he turns himself in to the police, which Orson was unwilling to do.\n At the conclusion of the fourth season, the series progresses five years into the future. Bree returns home from a poker game and is revealed to now be a businesswoman after the success of a cookbook she created. Her son, a much more mature Andrew, is shown to be his mother's assistant. Orson is heard upstairs revealing that he and Bree seemingly worked out their issues and remain married. Benjamin, however, is nowhere to be seen.\n Orson goes off to prison where he is constantly visited by Edie Britt. After Edie tells Bree off, Bree finally visits Orson in prison. A little while after, Danielle and her new husband Leo Katz come by and take Benjamin back. When Orson returns from prison, he is furious to find that Bree let Benjamin be taken away so easily.\n The season begins following the five-year jump that concluded the previous season. Bree's success as a businesswoman and repaired marriage to Orson is explained by flashbacks showing that two years after the conclusion of the fourth season, Bree's daughter, Danielle, married a lawyer named Leo Katz. Knowing she would win any custody case as Orson was in prison for running over Mike, Danielle reclaims Benjamin, her biological son, leaving Bree devastated. It is learned that Bree's success is the result of her putting the energy she had used to raise Benjamin into her work. She views her business as her \"baby\" and makes it her first priority.\nBree's success leaves Orson feeling unappreciated and ignored, making him become somewhat cold and changes his relationship with his wife dramatically. Orson is angry with Bree for using \"Van de Kamp\" in the title of her cookbook. Bree tries mollifying him by promising him a pot roast and Orson forces Bree not to, despite her returning home after midnight. Orson's criminal record makes it almost impossible to find a job so he asks Bree for one but she refuses because her business partner, Katherine Mayfair, threatens to quit if Orson is given a job. Orson becomes upset and goes to sleep in the guest bedroom. Bree eventually relents and gives Orson a job.\n Orson joins Tom Scavo's band and plays the keyboards until a fire breaks out at the White Horse Club and ends up with a broken nose.[16] He develops a habit of stealing from his neighbours, telling Bree that it gives him a thrill. He later tells a therapist that it makes him happy because it is something Bree cannot control. While trying to steal from a neighbour, he is caught and hit around the head with a baseball bat. He runs out into the street, causing Edie to crash her car and die. Horrified, Bree decides to divorce Orson and robs the house, attempting to hide assets but Orson finds out. He threatens her with sending her to prison for insurance fraud if she goes ahead with the divorce. Later, Orson is assaulted and threatened by a man hired by Karl Mayer, upsetting Bree as she did not want him harmed. Bree confronts Karl and accuses him of turning her into a different person but Karl admits that he likes what Bree is becoming, so she fires him and they begin an affair. Bree is initially reluctant, but a passionate kiss reveals that, like Karl, Bree is enjoying the person she has become, too.\n The season concludes at Mike Delfino's wedding two months later. Bree is seen sitting in the congregation with Orson, but turns and smiles seductively at Karl, insinuating that the two are secretly having an affair.\n Having blackmailed Bree by threatening to report her insurance fraud, Orson tries to repair their marriage by suggesting marriage counselling. Bree insists that she wants a divorce and begins an affair with Karl. Orson, however, is clueless. When Orson and Bree attend the Harvest dance together, they bump into Karl Mayer and his date, Orson is convinced that Bree still loves him when she spills oil on the dance floor, so Candice and Orson, (who are dancing), fall over. Whilst Orson believes this is jealousy of him dancing with Candice, Bree is, in fact, jealous of Karl sleeping with Candice. Relations seem to have thawed slightly between Orson and Bree when he serves her a meal at home and she tells him that someone in the service industry was rude to her, claiming it was a waitress in a cafe when it was actually a maid in a motel she visited with Karl. When Bree meets the maid again, the maid tries convincing her to end the affair as Orson seems like a good man, doing the shopping for Bree. It is clear Bree feels guilty and is upset when she sees Orson's hopeful expression at home wanting him to snap out of it and wants to tell him that she's not worth it anymore. Orson's suspicions are aroused of Bree's affair when he goes to replace a brooch Bree had received as a gift from her lover, Karl, claiming she had gotten it at an antique store, Orson went to the store only to find out they only sell furniture. Bree later assures him she got the stores mixed up, proving what trust Orson has for his wife. When Angie Bolen tells Bree what a perfect marriage she has Bree tells her that she and Orson barely speak any more and they haven't slept in the same bed for three months. Bree neglects to mention her affair with Karl, however.\n Over time, Orson begins to drink and becomes increasingly depressed. He then begins to suspect that Bree is having an affair and asks Angie Bolen, to spy on her while he is on a golf weekend with some old friends. She initially refuses, believing that Bree would never do such a thing. However, Angie soon discovers Bree and Karl's affair and when Orson arrives home early and almost catches them, Angie manages to get a hold of Bree and tell her to hide Karl. Afterward when Bree thanks Angie, who coldly tells Bree that she did not do it for her but for Orson, because she fears that he may be suicidal. Angie then asks Bree who she truly loves and though Bree continues to tell herself that she now only loves Karl, she still seems to have lingering love for Orson. Bree finally brings to Orson photos she'd set up of him and a former cellmate, telling him to grant her a divorce or she'll have his parole revoked. To her surprise, Orson reveals he was bluffing the entire time and all Bree had to do was ask for a divorce and promises to move out. He tells Bree to wait until he's gone to tell everyone about the divorce. During a neighborhood Christmas party, Karl tells Orson about having an affair with Bree and the two get into a fistfight inside a gingerbread house. Bree arrives to break it up and all three are inside when a crashing airplane smashes into the house.\n Orson's injuries leave him paralyzed (though he may walk again), but he is unwilling to live with Bree, who still wants a divorce. He moves in with Mrs. McCluskey and Roy before returning to Bree. After settling in with Bree, Orson begins to take revenge on Bree by forcing her to do unreasonable things such as cooking a dish that takes one hour to make. When Bree confronts him as she feels she's being harassed, Orson refuses to take a bath for days and acts rude to her. Having had enough, Bree forcibly bathes him on their frontyard and Orson breaks down, saying that it's hard to do the simplest things and he has lost his independence. Bree then apologizes to him. Orson then begins to plan on killing himself. However, his plans are halted when Bree discovers his drafted suicide note and goes above and beyond to stop him. He reveals that he wants to kill himself because he feels he has no purpose in life as no one loves him, claiming Bree only stays out of obligation and guilt. When he asks Bree if she loves him, she cannot bring herself to say the words, which seemingly proves Orson right. This leads to a final confrontation at a friend's anniversary party, Bree leaves Orson alone near a pool as she goes to hear the toast. When she sees how happy the elderly couple are as they dance, she looks over to see Orson heading for the pool to drown himself. Bree then rushes to stop him and tells him she wants to fall in love with him again. They then share a passionate kiss and finally reconcile. Bree then has trouble reconnecting with Orson not only mentally but sexually, so she asks former stripper Robin Gallagher for help. Robin suggests Bree restart their sex life, prompting Bree to later try giving Orson a lap-dance. The dance proves awkward, especially when Bree falls over and Orson runs over her foot with the wheelchair. Bree explains she wants to become intimate with her husband again, and the two share a romantic moment.\n When Sam Allen enters the lives of the Hodges, Orson is quick to side with Andrew and feels that Sam has a hidden agenda. When he finds out that Bree is being blackmailed by Sam, who is threatening to tell the Solises about how Andrew ran over Carlos's mother (unless Bree signs over her company to him) he is shocked to know what Andrew did. Orson and Andrew didn't think it would be fair for Bree to give up everything she has worked for, and both think she should let Sam tell the Solises, even though Andrew would get sent to jail, Andrew says that he thinks that it's time for him to pay for what he did. Still, Bree signs over the company to Sam, resulting in Orson leaving her because he is angry at Bree's hypocrisy that she had earlier made Orson confess to the police over his crimes when she covered up Andrew's.\n Orson makes a brief return in the season seven premiere \"Remember Paul?\" where he and Bree sign the divorce papers officially ending their marriage. They appear to be on relatively good terms as Bree asks Orson if he would still attend family dinners and events. Orson suggests to Bree she needs a project to keep her occupied. At first she ignores his advice but eventually she takes it and in turn meets her future boyfriend Keith Watson. Later Bree only mentioned to Richard Watson, father of Keith, that she's finally a divorc\u00e9e. In \"Assassins\", Orson returns, claiming that Judy dumped him and Bree lets him stay with her and Keith. Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is right for Bree as they have nothing in common and the two men have a food fight. Going to see Judy, Bree learns that Orson broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. Confronted, Orson confesses that's true and is convinced Bree can't be happy with a man so different from her. Bree allows Orson to stay with them but insists she's changed and is fine with Keith now. As Orson does not appear in subsequent episodes, it is implied that he has left Bree's house and his current whereabouts are left unknown.\n Orson unexpectedly returns to Fairview, claiming that the girls of Wisteria Lane had called him out of concern about Bree's drinking and bed-hopping. He arrives at the parking lot of a bar just as Bree is being assaulted by a man she had turned down. Despite still being in a wheelchair, Orson uses a taser to knock the man out and tells a grateful Bree that the two were always good at cleaning each other's messes.\n When Bree's friends try to see her, Orson says he happened to be passing by and saw Bree in trouble. He lies to Bree about the meeting, claiming her friends bad-mouthed her, which convinces her not to go to them to reconcile.  He convinces Bree to go away with him for the weekend and claims that he has changed ever since he learned to drive again after regaining some use of his legs.\n The viewer sees that Orson has been stalking Bree for months.  He saw the girls bury Alejandro's body and left the first mysterious note in Bree's mailbox, perhaps as part of a scheme to win her back. He convinces her to go away with him on a trip but Bree insists they stop at his apartment first. Despite Orson's attempts to clean up, Bree sees a photo he took of the girls taking away Alejandro's body and realizes Orson has been watching her all this time. He also confirms he is the one who killed Chuck Vance, the detective coming close to them, insisting it was all for Bree. She says she wants nothing to do with him and better off without him. Orson calls her later to say their love requires a sacrifice and Bree assumes he's going to kill himself. Instead, Orson mails a folder filled with evidence to the Fairview Police to implicate Bree in Alejandro's murder as his final revenge against her, and then leaves town for parts unknown.\n The mystery storyline of Orson in the third season received mixed reviews. Dave Anderson of TV Guide called the season premiere first-rate, while praising the comedic Bree storyline and declaring the set-up for the Orson mystery storyline ingenious.[17] Andy Dehnart of MSNBC cited Orson's storyline as a welcomed change from the slow-moving Applewhite mystery arc.[18]  On negative reviews, TV Guide writer Matt Roush unfavorably compared the Orson character to Bree's former love interest, George Williams (Roger Bart),[19] while Lindsay Soll of Entertainment Weekly simply labelled Orson's storyline as \"confusing\".[20]\n", " Who You Selling For Tour was the fourth headlining tour by American rock band The Pretty Reckless in support of their third studio album, Who You Selling For.\n The following set list is representative of the show on November 12, 2016 in House of Blues in Cleveland.[1]\n After the passing of Chris Cornell, the band postponed their May 19 show at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey just 3 hours before fans would be let into the venue.[2] Many fans had already made their way (or were on the way) to the venue by the time the band announced the postponement, some traveling from out-of-state. The band was criticized for performing the next day in Camden, stating that \"The show must go on\".[3] The band is also being criticized on social media due to the lack of communication about the rescheduled date of the Starland Ballroom show.[4][5][6] Over a month later, the band had not yet released any information for the rescheduled show.

It was constituted in 1938 as a federation of churches. It appointed its first bishop in 1955.[4] It is an Anglican church (though not a member of the Anglican Communion) and it relates closely to the Sydney Diocese of the Anglican Church of Australia, to which it is similar in that it sees itself as a bastion of the Reformation and particularly of reformed doctrine.[citation needed]\n The first Church of England service on record in South Africa was conducted by a naval chaplain in 1749. After the British occupation of the Cape in 1806, congregations were formed and churches were built.[4]\n In 1847 an Anglo-Catholic bishop was appointed to lead the church. He was determined to enforce Tractarianism on the Church. There were those who preferred to follow the Reformation principles and teachings of the Church of England. Thus, when in 1870 Bishop Gray formed the Church of the Province of SA (now the Anglican Church of Southern Africa), these evangelical Anglican clergy remained outside the new body.[citation needed]\n The synod of the CESA adopted the church's present[update] constitution in 1938. The draft was prepared by Howard Mowll, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney in Australia. The preamble and declaration of the constitution includes the following statement: \"The Church of England in South Africa, as a Reformed and Protestant Church, doth hereby reaffirm its constant witness against all those innovations in doctrine and worship, whereby the primitive faith hath been from time to time defaced or overlaid, and which at the Reformation, the Church of England did disown and reject.\"[6]:10\n James Hickenbotham made an attempt to unite CESA and the Anglican Church in South Africa in 1953. Hickenbotham presented proposals, known as the Thirteen Points, as a basis for negotiation. The 1954 synod rejected the proposals as their adoption would have placed the CESA in a weakened position compared to the Anglican Church in South Africa.[6]:10\n In 1959 Fred Morris of CESA contacted Joost de Blank, the Archbishop of Cape Town (Church of the Province of Southern Africa) suggesting that negotiations take place between the two churches with a view to reconciliation. The CPSA rejected this approach.[6]:11\n In 1984 Dudley Foord was appointed by Synod as Presiding Bishop. He was consecrated by the Archbishop of Sydney, Australia before taking up his episcopal duties in South Africa. George Alfred Swartz, the Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman, representing the Episcopal Synod of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, attended the consecration. Despite the conciliatory tone at Foord's consecration, the Presiding Bishop of CESA was not invited to attend the Lambeth Conference held in 1988 either as a bishop of the Anglican Church or as a bishop of a church in full communion with the Anglican denomination.[6]:12\n At Synod 2013 The Church of England in South Africa voted to change its trading name to The Reformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa, REACH-SA. At Synod 2014 Desmond Ingelsby resigned as the presiding bishop due to bad health. Synod appointed several bishops to do the work of the presiding bishop until a presiding bishop was appointed. Glen Lyons was appointed the Chairman of the group.[citation needed]\n Although REACH-SA has been excluded from the Lambeth Conference, its ministerial orders are recognised by the Anglican Communion, and these orders derive from Bishop Fred Morris, a former Anglican missionary bishop in North Africa, who moved in 1955 to South Africa, much to the irritation[citation needed] of the then Archbishop of Canterbury. Several REACH-SA clerics have controversially[7] served in the Church of England.\n In 2009, the denomination was composed of just under 200 congregations, with a total of about 120,000 members. All churches must contribute 10% of their income to a central fund, but in practice some churches do not. Christ Church, Midrand; Christ Church, Pinetown; and St James Church, Kenilworth all have memberships of several thousand, with attendances on Sunday morning services at about 1000. The average church size is about 150.[citation needed]\n The Reformed Evangelical Anglican Church of South Africa is a member of the World Reformed Fellowship.[9]\n The church's canons allow for lay presidency at Holy Communion and also the use of grape juice instead of fermented wine. All references to baptismal regeneration and absolution have been eliminated from the denomination's alternative prayer book, as has the word catholic in the creeds (Nicene Creed and Apostles' Creed).[citation needed]\n George Whitefield College (GWC), the official REACH-SA theological training facility in Cape Town is modelled on Moore Theological College in Sydney, Australia. The founding principal of GWC was Broughton Knox; the current principal is Mark Dickson.  Another REACH-SA college is the Kwazulu-Natal Missionary Bible College (formerly known as Trinity Academy) in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal.[citation needed]\n The REACH-SA has been involved in the Anglican realignment and was one of the denominations that participated at the launching of the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans in South Africa, on 3 September 2009.[10] The Presiding Bishop of REACH-SA, Glenn Lyons, consecrated the Rev. Jonathan Pryke, of Jesmond Parish Church, as an overseas bishop, the first ever in Europe, on 2 May 2017.[11] This was controversial due to REACH-SA's status outside of the Anglican Communion, and because the consecration occurred without the knowledge of the Bishop of Newcastle. It wasn't also officially sanctioned by the GAFCON UK.[12] REACH-SA justified the consecration because their bishops \"have regularly stood in to help with ordinations and other episcopal ministry to the Jesmond Parish Church due to its members being in impaired communion with their own diocesan bishop\".[13]\n The REACH-SA was part of the South African delegation that attended GAFCON III on 17-22 June 2018 in Jerusalem.[14]\n", " A mooring mast, or mooring tower, is a structure designed to allow for the docking of an airship outside of an airship hangar or similar structure. More specifically, a mooring mast is a mast or tower that contains a fitting on its top that allows for the bow of the airship to attach its mooring line to the structure.[1]\nWhen it is not necessary or convenient to put an airship into its hangar (or shed) between flights, airships can be moored on the surface of land or water, in the air to one or more wires, or to a mooring mast.  After their development mooring masts became the standard approach to mooring airships as considerable manhandling was avoided.[2]\n Airship mooring masts can be broadly divided into fixed high masts and fixed or mobile low (or \u2018stub\u2019) masts.  In the 1920s and 1930s masts were built in many countries.  At least two were mounted on ships.  Without doubt the tallest mooring mast ever designed was the spire of the Empire State Building which was originally constructed to serve as a mooring mast,[3] although soon after converted for use as a television and radio transmitter tower[4] due to the discovered infeasibility of mooring an airship, for any length of time, to a very tall mast in the middle of an urban area.[3]\n Mooring an airship by the nose to the top of a mast or tower of some kind might appear to be an obvious solution, but dirigibles had been flying for some years before the mooring mast made its appearance.  The first airship known to have been moored to a mast was HMA (His Majesty's Airship) No.1, named the \u2018Mayfly\u2019, on 22 May 1911. The 38\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) mast was mounted on a pontoon, and a windbreak of cross-yards with strips of canvas were attached to it.  However, the windbreak caused the ship to yaw badly, and she became  more stable when it was removed, withstanding winds gusting up to 43 miles per hour (69\u00a0km/h).[5] Further experiments in mooring blimps to cable-stayed lattice masts were carried out during 1918.[6]\n The British mooring mast was developed more or less to its final form at Pulham and Cardington in 1919\u201321 to make the landing process easier and more economical of manpower [2]\n The following account of the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.[7]\n Mooring masts were developed to act as a safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.\n The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, 200 feet (61\u00a0m) high, tapering from 70 feet (21\u00a0m) diameter at ground level to 26\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (8.1\u00a0m) at the passenger platform, 170 feet (52\u00a0m) from the ground.  Above the passenger platform was the 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m) of the conical housing for the mooring gear.  A lower platform 142 feet (43\u00a0m) above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) wide.\nThe top platform, at the height of 170 feet (52\u00a0m), from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 feet (12\u00a0m) in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet.  The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind.  An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.\n The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 feet (7.0\u00a0m) above the passenger platform.  A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement.  The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.\n A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower.  The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.\n In the machinery house at the base of the tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.\n \n  While an airship approached the mast slowly against the wind a mooring cable was let out from nose to the ground and linked, by a ground party, to the end of the mooring cable paid out from the mast head.  The cable was then slowly wound in with the airship riding about 600 feet (180\u00a0m) above the mast and down wind, with one engine running astern to maintain a pull on the cable.  At this point, two side wires \u2013 or \u2018yaw guys\u2019 \u2013 were also connected to cables taken from the nose of the airship to pulley blocks some hundreds of feet apart on the ground and thence to winches at the base of the mast.\n All three cables were then wound in together, the main pull being taken on the mooring cable while the yaw guys steadied the ship.  When all the cable had been wound, an articulated mooring cone on the nose of the airship locked home into the cup on the mast.  The mast fitting was made free to rotate as the airship swung with the wind with freedom also for pitch and roll.[8]\n \nA gangway, like a drawbridge, which could be drawn up flush with the nose of the airship, was then let down with its free end resting on the parapet of the platform running round the mast.  Passengers and crew boarded and disembarked from the ship under cover along this gangway.  About twelve men were needed to moor an airship to a mast. Four high masts of the Cardington type were built along the proposed British Empire Airship Service routes, at Cardington itself, at Montreal (Canada), Ismailia (Egypt) and Karachi (then India, now in Pakistan).  None of these survive.   Similar masts were proposed at sites in Australia, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Bombay, Keeling Islands, Kenya, Malta, at Ohakea in New Zealand, and in South Africa.[9] The general site specifications can be found in documents produced by the British government.[10]\n \nGerman mooring methods differed significantly from those adopted by the British. To quote Pugsley (1981):[11]  \"the Germans, originally for ease of transport and for economy, developed a system using much lower masts. The nose of the ship was tethered as before to the mast head, which was only a little higher than the semi-diameter of the ship's hull. The lower fin at the stern was then fixed to a heavy carriage running on a circular railway track around the mast, and this carriage was powered so as to be able to move around the track to keep the ship head on to the wind. In the most sophisticated form, used by the Hindenburg, the rail system was linked to rails running from the mast straight into the airship shed, and the mast was powered so that the ship could be moved mechanically into the shed, complete with mast and stern carriage\".\n The following account of landing the German airship Graf Zeppelin is abridged from Dick and Robinson (1985):[12]\n Before attempting a landing, contact was made by radio or flag signals with the ground crew to determine the ground temperature and wind conditions.  For a normal calm weather landing the ship was trimmed very slightly nose down, as this gave a better gliding angle and the ship almost flew herself down.  A smoky fire was started on the ground to show the wind direction.  The ship then made a long approach with a rate of fall of 100 feet per minute, and the lines were dropped when she was over the landing flag.  When conditions were unusual, as in gusty and bumpy weather, the Graf was weighed off a little light, and the approach had to be fast and preferably long and low.\n When the airship was over the field the engines had to be reversed for some time to stop her, and this also helped to get the nose down.  Yaw lines dropped from the ship's nose were drawn out to Port and Starboard by thirty men each, while twenty more on each side pulled the ship down with spider lines (so called because twenty short lines radiated like the legs of a spider from a block).  When the airship reached the ground, fifty men held the control car rails and twenty held those of the after car.  With thirty men in reserve, the ground crew totalled two hundred men.\n The ground crew would then walk the Graf to a short, or \u2018stub\u2019, mast, to which the nose of the airship would be attached.  The airship would then rest on the ground with its rear gondola attached to a movable weighted carriage that enabled the airship to swing around the mast with the wind.  In some places the stub mast was mounted on rails and could be drawn into the airship hangar, guiding the nose of the ship while the tail was controlled by the carriage attached to the rear gondola.  Airships designed for landing on the ground had pneumatic bumper bags or undercarriage wheels under the main and rear gondolas (or tail fin).\n Dick states that the Germans never used mooring masts until the Graf Zeppelin entered service in 1928, and never moored to high masts.  To some extent this probably reflects the conservatism of the Zeppelin company operations.  Long experience in handling airships in all sorts of conditions was valued and innovations or significant changes in practice were unlikely to be adopted unless clear advantages were apparent.\n In the US a mix of techniques were applied, and airships moored to both high and stub masts.  Large ground crews (or \u2018landing parties\u2019) of up to 340 men were required to manage the large airships Akron and Macon at landing or on the ground, before they could be attached to the stub mast.  \nBeing part of a ground crew was not risk-free.  In gusty conditions, or if mis-handled, an airship could suddenly rise.  If the ground crew did not immediately let go of the handling lines they risked being carried off their feet.  In one famous incident captured on movie film in 1932, during the landing of the US airship Akron, three men were carried off their feet in this way, two to fall to their deaths after a short time.  The third managed to improve his hold on the handling rope until he could be hauled into the airship.[5][13]\n At least two ships have mounted mooring masts.  As the US intended to use large airships for long-range maritime patrol operations[14] experiments were made in mooring airships to a mast mounted on the ship USS\u00a0Patoka.\n Over time the airships USS\u00a0Shenandoah, Los Angeles, and Akron all moored to the mast mounted at the stern of the ship, and operated using her as a base for resupply, refuelling and gassing.[15]\n The Spanish seaplane carrier D\u00e9dalo (1922\u20131935) carried a mooring mast at the bow to cater for small dirigibles carried on board.[16][17]\n Around 1925 the Royal Navy considered the monitor HMS Roberts for conversion to a mobile airship base with a mooring mast and fueling capabilities, but nothing came of this proposal.[18]\n Smaller mobile masts have been used for small airships and blimps for a long time.  They may be wheel or track-mounted, and can be operated by a small crew. The general operating principle is broadly similar to the larger masts.  Modern blimps may operate from mobile masts for months at a time without returning to their hangars.[2]\n USS Akron approaches mast, circa 1931-1933\n USS Shenandoah attached to a mast\n USS Los Angeles at a near-vertical position\n A stub mast in Recife - the only one preserved in its original form. 8\u00b004\u203242\u2033S 34\u00b055\u203235\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff8.078434\u00b0S 34.9263243\u00b0W\ufeff / -8.078434; -34.9263243\n A modern blimp approaches its mobile mooring mast.\n Contemporary ship attached to a mast\n The Hindenburg disaster\n", " \n Dizoniopsis herberti is a species of sea snail, a gastropod in the family Cerithiopsidae. It was described by Jay and Drivas, in 2002.[1][2]\n \n", " Regietheater (German for director's theater) is the modern (mainly post-World War II) practice of allowing a director freedom in devising the way a given opera or play is staged so that the creator's original, specific intentions or stage directions (where supplied) can be changed, together with major elements of geographical location, chronological situation, casting and plot. Typically such changes may be made to point a particular political point or modern parallels which may be remote from traditional interpretations.\n Examples found in Regietheater productions may include some or all of the following:\n It can be argued that Regietheater began with the work of Wieland Wagner (1917\u20131966), who in the years after World War II responded to the profound problematisation of the work of his grandfather, Richard Wagner, resulting from its earlier appropriation by the Nazis, by designing and producing minimalist and heavily symbolic stagings of Wagner operas in Bayreuth and elsewhere. Guided by the theories of Adolphe Appia, Wieland Wagner's productions allegedly sought to emphasise the epic and universal aspects of the Wagner dramas, and were justified as being attempts to explore the texts from the viewpoint of (often Jungian) depth psychology. In practice this would mean, for example, that the opening act of Die Walk\u00fcre (the second work of the Ring Cycle), specifically described as set in Hunding's forest hut, was presented on a stage shaped as a large, sloping disc: no hut was either seen or implied, and the composer's many detailed instructions relating to the actions of Wehwalt, Sieglinde and Hunding within the hut were disregarded because it was said that the details of the scoring meant that they were already illustrated musically.\n Examples\n Supporters of Regietheater will insist that works from earlier centuries not only permit but even demand to be re-invented in ways that not only fit  contemporary intellectual fashion but even strive to connect them with situations and locations of which the original composers and librettists could not have conceived, thus setting the story into a context the contemporary audience can relate to.\n In recent years, the appointment of \"celebrity\" directors (often from film or other branches of theatre),  who do not appear to have learned the specific requirements of opera direction[citation needed] including, in some cases, those who have flaunted their inability to read music,[citation needed] and who seem to be unable to psychologically direct singers behind unreflected Regietheater clich\u00e9s (often involving gratuitous shock elements), has led to a general misapprehension of the Regietheater term by both theatres and critics.\n Opponents will accuse such producers of shallowness, crudity, sensationalism, lack of real creativity, insensitivity to the richness of the original setting, neglect of the role played by the music, and of pandering to the appetites of ephemeral journalism.[citation needed] More and more, however, critics distinguish between \"proper\" application of Regietheater principles, and the gratuitous use of misunderstood Regietheater stereotypes.[9]\n", " Jeff Schwartz (born February 24, 1964, in New Haven, Connecticut) is President and Founder of Excel Sports Management, a full-service sports management and marketing agency.

Martin co-wrote one of Cream's best known songs, \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\", created the cover art for Cream's Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire albums, and in the 1970s became a champion of singer Tiny Tim, and of Sydney's embattled Luna Park.\n Sharp was born in Bellevue Hill, New South Wales in 1942, and educated at Cranbrook private school, where one of his teachers was the artist Justin O'Brien. In 1960, Sharp enrolled at the National Art School at East Sydney, where he contributed to the short-lived student magazine The Arty Wild Oat, along with fellow artists Garry Shead and John Firth Smith. He also submitted cartoons to The Bulletin. In 1961, he enrolled for two terms in architecture at Sydney University before returning to the National Art School.\n In 1962 Sharp met Richard Neville, editor of the University of NSW student magazine Tharunka, and Richard Walsh, editor of its Sydney University counterpart Honi Soit. Both wanted to publish their own \"magazine of dissent\" and they asked Sharp and Shead to become contributors. The magazine was dubbed OZ. From 1963 though to February 1966 when he left Australia for London, Sharp was its art director and a major contributor.\n Sydney OZ was first published on April Fool's Day, 1963. Its irreverent attitude was in the tradition of the student newspapers, but its satirical and topical coverage of local and national issues and people developed a national profile, and made it a target for \"the Establishment\", and soon a prominent casualty of the so-called \"Censorship Wars\".\n Sharp held his first one-man exhibition at the Clune Galleries in Sydney in 1965. \"Art for Mart's Sake\" almost sold out on the opening night. One of the paintings exhibited also featured in Shead's James Bond spoof Blunderball, made earlier that year.\n During the life of Australian OZ Sharp, Neville and Walsh were twice charged with printing an obscene publication. The first trial was relatively minor, and should have been a non-event, but they were poorly advised and pleaded guilty, which resulted in their convictions being recorded. As a result, when they were charged with obscenity a second time, their previous convictions meant that the new charges were considerably more serious.\n The charges centred on two items in the early issues of OZ\u2014one was Sharp's ribald poem \"The Word Flashed Around The Arms\", which satirised the contemporary habit of youths gatecrashing parties; the other offending item was the well known photo (used on the cover of OZ #6) which depicted Neville and two friends pretending to urinate into a Tom Bass sculptural wall fountain, set into the wall of the new P&O office in Sydney, which had recently been opened by Prime Minister Robert Menzies.\n Sharp, Neville and Walsh were tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Their convictions caused a public outcry and they were subsequently acquitted on appeal, but the so-called \"OZ Three\" realised that there was little future battling such strong opposition.\n In 1966 Sharp published a selection of cartoons in the book Martin Sharp Cartoons. \"Swinging London\" was a mecca for young artists, writers and musicians, and after the OZ trials, Sharp and Neville needed little encouragement to leave Australia. They set off on an overland trek through Asia, parting company in Kathmandu and making their separate ways to London.\n On arrival, Sharp stayed for a short time with Neville's sister, writer Jill Neville in Knightsbridge before sharing a Chelsea studio with photographer Robert Whitaker.[4] It was at this time that he was introduced to a musician in the London nightclub, The Speakeasy. During the evening, Sharp told the musician about a poem he had recently written; the musician in turn told Sharp that he was looking for a lyric for some new music he had just written. Sharp obligingly wrote out the poem and his address on a serviette and gave it to his new acquaintance.\n The musician turned out to be guitarist Eric Clapton. The song that resulted from the meeting, \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\", was recorded as the B-side of Cream's smash hit \"Strange Brew\" and was included on Cream's second album Disraeli Gears. His friendship with Clapton led to the commission to design the famous 'dayglo' psychedelic collage cover for that album, which included painted photographs by Sharp's friend Robert Whitaker, whom Sharp knew from Australia and whose studio was in the same building where Sharp lived.\n The following year Sharp designed the gatefold sleeve for Cream's third album, the double LP Wheels of Fire (1968), for which he won the New York Art Directors Prize for Best Album Design in 1969. He also designed the cover for the eponymous debut L.P. of London underground band Mighty Baby (1969).\n Not long after his meeting with Clapton, Sharp moved into The Pheasantry at 152 Kings Road, Chelsea, a Georgian building. As the name suggests, the site was originally used to raise pheasants for the royal household. In the early 1900s (decade), it was the home of Eleanor Thornton, the favourite model of artist and sculptor Charles Sykes. Thornton is believed to have been the model for Sykes' most famous work, his Rolls Royce mascot the Spirit of Ecstasy.\n In the 1920s and 1930s, it housed the studio of dance teacher Serafina Astafieva, who trained several of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes dancers and who taught prima ballerinas Alicia Markova and Margot Fonteyn. By the time Sharp moved in, The Pheasantry was a well-known 'artists' colony', its rooms rented out as apartments and residential studio space. The basement also housed a nightclub which operated into the 1970s. The Pheasantry nightclub was the venue for early UK gigs by Lou Reed, Queen and Hawkwind, among others, and was where singer Yvonne Elliman was discovered by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, leading to her role in the original soundtrack recording of Jesus Christ Superstar. The Pheasantry currently houses apartments, shops and a pizza restaurant, which has retained Madame Astafieva's mirrors and practice barre as a feature on the first floor.\n Sharp shared this domicile with Eric Clapton (who moved in not long after Sharp did), Germaine Greer, filmmaker Philippe Mora, artist Timothy Whidborne, David Litvinoff (later an adviser on the production of Nicolas Roeg's Performance), writer Anthony Haden-Guest (author of The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night) and Sharp's friend Robert Whitaker, the preferred photographer for many leading rock groups, including The Beatles. Whitaker was already famous/infamous for the controversial \"butcher\" photo used on the original cover of the Beatles' album Yesterday and Today.\n Many years later, Sharp recalled the story of his meeting with Clapton:\n \"I visited the Speakeasy Club in London one evening (1967). I saw a girl I knew, Charlotte, who was sitting at a table with two young men who I didn't know. Being alone I asked if I could join them and I was made welcome. I remember that there was a discussion about a controversial article which had appeared in The Idealist concerning the assassination of President Kennedy. I gathered that the young men were musicians and as I had just written a poem which I thought would make a good song, I mentioned this fact, and one of the musicians replied that he had just written some music. In grand show business tradition I wrote the lyrics on a paper serviette and gave them to him with my address. I was sharing a studio off the Kings Road Chelsea with the photographer, Bob Whitaker, at the time. I was pleasantly surprised when the musician, who turned out to be Eric Clapton, arrived at the studio with a 45 r.p.m. record with \"Strange Brew\" on the A-side and my song, \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" on the B-side.\"\n \"Soon after I moved to a nearby studio in \"The Pheasantry\", Kings Road, Chelsea, and needing someone to share with I asked my new friend if he would care to share the space and experience. Chelsea was an exciting place to live and Eric agreed. (David Litvinoff, a well-known and extraordinary character in the music and art world had found the studio.) It was a perfect place to work and live. Charlotte eventually moved in with Eric. Later we were joined by my girlfriend, a Finish model called Eija Veka Aho, and a young friend from Melbourne, painter and filmmaker, Philippe Mora, and his girlfriend, Freya. David Litvinoff worked in Tim Whidbornes' studio downstairs... Anthony Haden-Guest had a flat there...Germaine Greer was writing \"The Female Eunuch\" in a room there... there were photographic studios...it was quite a special and creative building...it was called \"The Pheasantry\" because in the old days the land had been used for breeding pheasants for the King's table.\n \"Eric asked me to design the cover for \"Disraeli Gears\". I loved record cover art and was very happy to do it. I commissioned my ex-studio mate, Bob Whitaker, to take some photos which were used in a collage on the back cover. I believe the photo used on the cover was a publicity shot that I got from Eric. I was using fluorescent paints at the time. It was the height of psychedelia.\n \"Some of the ingredients in the cover are made up from Victorian decorative engravings. It was done in black and white first and then painted with fluorescent colors. I tried to capture the warm joyful liveliness of Cream's songs. I later went on to design the cover for \"Wheels Of Fire\" for Cream and also for Ginger Baker's \"Airforce\", a band called Mighty Baby...Jeannie Lewis' \"Free Fall Through Featherless Flight\" and a few of my own releases of Tiny Tim, \"Chameleon\", \"Keeping My Troubles To Myself\", and \"The World Non-Stop Singing Record.\"\n \"In the basement of The Pheasantry was a club of the same name and often one's sleep was disturbed by the R&B bass notes...so I was reacting by listening to a lot of old songs that had been re-released. Al Jolson, Al Bowly... the dance bands of the war years and earlier. Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and \"Hutch\" (Leslie Hutchinson). Eric had seen Tiny Tim perform at The Scene in New York City and knowing I loved the old songs he urged me to go and see Tiny in his first London performance at the Royal Albert Hall. I'd never heard Tiny before and I was completely amazed by his extraordinary, joyful persona and his absolute mastery over the whole language of popular song. I felt I would love to work with him, but thought he was destined to the heights of stardom. I never felt the opportunity would arise. Over twenty years later I write this on letterhead from the film, \"Street of Dreams\" I have been making with Tiny over the last 12 years, thinking of the hundreds of songs and conversations I have recorded with him over the years. Thus was my entry into the world of popular song.\n \n\"The meeting of musician and artist directly without intermediaries is, and always has and will be, a fruitful one. Such was the goodwill that existed in London during the late '60's that a painter from Australia could meet a great musician from England and informally give him some lyrics which would become a song, a friendship, a career with Tiny Tim, and a record cover.\" Freed from the constraints of nine-to-five work thanks to an allowance from his maternal grandfather,[5] Sharp found himself at the centre of London's counter-cultural life and the Underground scene and quickly became one of its leading lights. When Richard Neville arrived in London in September, and he and Sharp jointly established London OZ, which proved even more controversial than its Australian parent. Sharp became its Art Director and chief cartoonist. Although the magazine struggled to find its feet, Sharp's Plant a Child image in the July 1967 issue helped transform OZ's fortunes and became an icon of the Summer of Love.[6]\n This period in London and his work with OZ brought him international renown. As well as his OZ artwork and his famed album covers for Cream, he produced famous posters of musicians\u2014Bob Dylan, Donovan and his classic 'exploding' Jimi Hendrix poster, based on a photo by Linda McCartney. These and other works like the poster for the \"Legalise Pot\" rally are keynote graphic works of the period and originals are now highly prized collector's items. He also designed at that time a controversial poster titled \"Rasputin & his London Popes\" for an antique shop in Barcelona run by a young Spanish photographer named Alexis de Vilar.\n In 1969 Sharp held his second solo exhibition at the Sigi Krauss Gallery. Entitled \"Sharp Martin and his Silver Scissors\" it featured collages based on famous works of art. He returned to Australia later that year, taking up residency in the old Clune Galleries. Thelma Clune, the director, had decided to sell the building, but there was no rush for the sale, and under the watchful eye of mutual friend \"Charlie\" Brown, Sharp presented his first exhibition after his return.\n This was followed by The Incredible Shrinking Exhibition, which comprised photographs of the first show re-exhibited in small gem-like mirror frames. These two exhibitions laid the foundations for the famous Yellow House project of 1970\u201371. The house became a unique multimedia space, an art environment in which each room was an entire art work. The Yellow House was open 24 hours a day and had thousands of visitors between 1971 and 1973 when it closed.\n Returning to London in 1972, Sharp continued his interest with the idea of appropriation. He created \"Art Book\", another miniature production, approximately 5\" x 6\" in size and incorporating 36 colour collages cut from the pages of glossy art books, bringing together the work in single images of Magritte and Van Gogh, Matisse and Magritte, Botticelli and Picasso with occasional overlays of Van Gogh on Van Gogh, Van Gogh on Botticelli, or Vermeer on Vermeer.\n \"I have never been shy about cutting things up if I had a good idea. To me it was worth the price of a book for the idea it expressed, the interconnecting of different worlds. I could put a Gauguin figure in a Van Gogh landscape, make the composition work, and also say something about their relationship.\" Distributed in the United Kingdom, France and Italy in 1972, \"Artbook\" was released in Australian in 1973 to coincide with Sharp's return to Australia and his \"Art Exhibition\" at the Bonython Gallery, Sydney. The previous collage images were presented as completed paintings, returning them to their original medium. Extending viewer involvement, one work, Self Portrait was simply a mirror in an ornate gold frame while another more iconicised work was a linen, cheap reproduction of the Mona Lisa in an equally ornate gold frame, entitled Tea Towel.\n During the mid-Seventies, Sharp was probably best known in Australia for his work with the Nimrod Theatre, for whom he produced his famous series of posters, as well as designing numerous sets, costumes and scenery pieces. His famous Nimrod posters (now prized collectors' items) include his iconic poster for the plays Young Mo, The Venetian Twins, and Kold Komfort Kaffee. Sharp's rendering of the \"Mo\" face became the symbol of the Nimrod Theatre; and one of his best known images. In this period he also designed the classic cover for Jeannie Lewis' debut album Free Fall Through Featherless Flight (1974).\n Sharp designed at least two posters for Australia's premier contemporary circus, Circus Oz including the iconic 'World-famous'/'Non-Stop Energy' design.\n For the most of the 1970s and beyond, Sharp's work and life was dominated by two major interests: Sydney's Luna Park and the entertainer Tiny Tim.\n Sharp's involvement with the restoration of Luna Park in the 1970s proved a bittersweet experience. He was engaged as designer and artist to oversee the restoration of Luna Park, including a commission to renovate the enormous laughing face at the entrance; he also painted a large eye with a reflective pupil on the inside of the gate, but this was subsequently painted over. In 1978, he and fellow artist/designer Richard Liney (who had participated in the reconstruction of Luna Park, also an avid collector of memorabilia), lent their combined collection of hundreds of fairground, circus, Luna Park and sideshow artefacts to the Art Gallery of NSW to coincide with the Festival of Sydney.\n A year later, as pressure mounted to redevelop the prime harbourside site, an arson attack in the Luna Park Ghost Train claimed seven lives, including a father and his two sons. The Luna Park fire was a turning point in Sharp's life; like many others he firmly believed that the fire was a deliberate act of terrorism aimed at destroying the park and making the site available for redevelopment and in a 2010 interview on the ABC Radio National program The Spirit of Things,[7] he revealed that the fire and the circumstances surrounding it had exerted a profound effect on his spiritual outlook.[8]\n Along with various other artist friends and sympathetic supporters, Sharp was instrumental in forming the Friends of Luna Park in an endeavour to lobby the State Government and remind Sydneysiders of what they stood to lose if the park was lost. Sharp's painting Snow Job was an expression of his feelings about this matter, and if it had not been for the efforts of Sharp and his friends and supporters, Sydney might have lost an important part of its character.\n Sharp first saw performer Tiny Tim at the Royal Albert Hall in 1968 at the suggestion of Eric Clapton. From that time on, Tiny Tim was one of Sharp's strongest inspirations.\n \"Tim's appropriation of song is very much like my appropriation of images. We are both collagists taking the elements of different epochs and mixing them to discover new relationships.\"  Sharp's appreciation of Tiny Tim manifested itself in many ways, including record production, costume design and other works. He created a five-metre painting now hanging in Macquarie University, painted during the mid-1970s with Tim Lewis. His Tiny Tim Opera House concert poster is one of his most memorable and collectible images.\n His cherished Tiny Tim film project Street of Dreams is commemorated in the painting Film Script. He laboured for over a decade on this film and it almost forced him to sell his house to finance it. However, the story goes that on the eve of the sale, Sharp received a surprise cheque in the mail: a substantial royalty payment for his lyrics for \"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\", which enabled him to continue working on the film without having to sell his house.\n Another recurring element in Sharp's work is the \"Eternity\" signature. The origin of this image was the remarkable story of Sydney man Arthur Stace, also known as \"Mr Eternity\". Stace was an illiterate former soldier, petty criminal and alcoholic who became a devout convert to Christianity in 1930. For years after his conversion up until his death in 1967, Stace walked the streets of Sydney at night writing the single word \"Eternity\" on walls and footpaths in his unmistakable copperplate handwriting. For years, Stace's identity remained unknown until it was finally revealed in a newspaper article in 1956. Sharp has perpetuated and celebrated Stace's work and message, and the 'Eternity' image has appeared in many of his works, including a poster celebrating Sydney's Haymarket area, and a large canvas that first appeared in the Oxford Street window of a Sydney store in 1990. During the millennium celebrations in 2000, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was lit up with the word \"Eternity\", as a tribute to the legacy of Arthur Stace, made popular by Martin Sharp.[9]\n Sharp's work was celebrated in many exhibitions including a special Yellow House exhibition at the Art Gallery of NSW and a major retrospective at the Museum of Sydney which ran from October 2009 to March 2010.\n Sharp maintained a lifelong friendship with artist Lin Utzon, daughter of the Sydney Opera House architect J\u00f8rn Utzon. The Danish architect was controversially forced from his uncompleted masterpiece in 1966 and secretly left Australia with the aid of Sharp's mother.\n In the mid-1990s, Sharp helped broker a reconciliation between the Sydney Opera House and J\u00f8rn Utzon, who subsequently developed a set of design principles to guide the building's future.[10]\n Sharp inherited the heritage-listed house Wirian,[11] in Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill, Sydney, in 1978. The house had been bought by Sharp's grandfather, Stuart Douglas Ritchie, a merchant, in 1937 for 20,000 pounds.[12] Sharp lived there until he died from emphysema on 1 December 2013, at the age of 71.[13]\n", " John Talbot, 10th Earl of Shrewsbury, 10th Earl of Waterford (1601 \u2013 8 February 1654), was an English nobleman.\n He was the only child and son of John Talbot of Longford, Newport, Shropshire (died London, 1607 or c. 1607), and wife Eleanor Baskerville, daughter of Sir Thomas Baskerville of Wolvershill, Herefordshire, and of Brinsop, Herefordshire, and paternal grandson of Sir John Talbot of Grafton and Catherine or Katharine Petre.\n He remained in his family's Roman Catholic faith and took part on the side of King Charles I in the English Civil War.  He was First Commissioner of Advice for the counties of Worcestershire, Shropshire and Staffordshire in 1644/45, and he served on the Royalist garrison at Worcester when it surrendered to Parliament in July 1646.  In 1647 his estates were sequestered and compounded by Parliament on grounds of his being a \"Papist and delinquent\" (i.e. Catholic and royalist).[1]\n In September 1651 he accompanied Charles II when he fled after defeat at the battle of Worcester, escorting him to White Ladies Priory in Shropshire, where the king was hidden for a time.[1] The Earl died in 1653/54 at Tasmore, Oxfordshire,[1] and was succeeded by his second son.\n Talbot married Mary Fortescue, by whom he had five children: \n He later married Hon.

Since 2002, she has served as the head coach of the University of Maryland women's basketball team. In her fourth year as head coach, she won the 2006 Women's National Championship. She won the 2009 ACC Regular Season and Tournament Championships \u2013 the women's first ACC Championship since 1989. She won another ACC Championship in 2012 and reached another Final Four in 2014. Maryland moved to the Big Ten for the 2014\u201315 season and Frese led the Terrapins to an undefeated 18\u20130 conference record and a Big Ten Regular Season Championship in their first year in the Big Ten. She was voted AP National Coach of the Year in 2002,[2] ACC Coach of the Year in 2013, Big Ten Coach of the Year in both 2002 and 2015, and MAC Coach of the Year in 2000. At Maryland, she's coached four ACC Players of the Year and four ACC Freshmen of the Year.\n Brenda Frese is the daughter of Bill and Donna Frese. She has five siblings: Deb, Cindy, Marsha, Stacy, and Jeff.[2] She attended Washington High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.[2] While in high school, Frese played on the basketball and volleyball teams for four years, as well as the track and softball teams for one year. She was a four-year basketball letterwinner, an Honorable Mention All-American and Iowa state champion in 1988, and an all-state and all-metro player from 1986 to 1988.[2]\n Frese attended the University of Arizona as an undergraduate student. From 1989 until 1993 she played three seasons for the varsity basketball team. In 1989, she was selected for a Pac-10 tour of West Germany. Frese graduated from the university with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications in 1993. In 1995, she graduated from Kent State University with a master's degree in Athletic Administration.[2]\n While injured as a player at the University of Arizona, Brenda Frese volunteered as an assistant coach at Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona. Upon graduation, she immediately began pursuing a career in coaching, driving across the country to attend an NCAA Final Four and working various basketball camps. Frese's career officially started in 1994 as an assistant coach at Kent State and Iowa State and then spent three years as head coach at Ball State and Minnesota. In her very first game as a head coach, Frese led Ball State to an upset win over Minnesota. Less than two years later, Minnesota hired Frese as their new head coach. During her 2001\u201302 season at Minnesota, she led a one-year turnaround of 8\u201320 to 22\u20138, one of the biggest in NCAA history. Minnesota made it to the 2nd round of the NCAA Championship that year, and Frese was named the AP National Coach of the Year for 2002.  Minnesota's fan base quickly grew and the team was able to make a move to start playing its games in the same arena as the men's team.  After turning around the Minnesota program, Frese became a sought after coach and drew interest from Maryland, Ohio State and Florida. Maryland Athletic Director Debbie Yow sealed the deal the night of the 2002 Men's NCAA Basketball Championship game, in which Maryland defeated Indiana for the national championship.\n Frese was awarded the US Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) Coach of the Year award in 2002.[3]\n When Frese arrived at Maryland prior to the 2002\u201303 season, she brought with her the buzz of a rising star in the women's hoops coaching world, as well as a remarkable recruiting acumen. Her first highly coveted recruits, Shay Doron and Kalika France, marked the beginning of an ever-expanding stream of blue-chip talent choosing to take their talents to College Park.\n Despite winning only 10 games in her first season, Frese, the 2002 AP National Coach of the Year, has quickly returned Maryland to national prominence.  As of the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Frese has guided Maryland to an overall record of 278\u201394 (.750) including nine NCAA tournament berths, nine consecutive 20-win seasons, six 25+ win seasons, four 30+ win seasons, four Elite Eights, the program's fourth NCAA Final Four appearance and the 2006 NCAA Women's Basketball National Championship. Maryland received its first-ever No. 1 preseason national ranking in 2006\u201307. The Terps remained in the top spot in the polls for 10-consecutive weeks. Frese led Maryland to the 2008\u201309 ACC regular season and 2009 ACC Tournament championships, as well as the 2012 ACC Tournament championship.\n Player-wise, all seniors to play for Frese at Maryland have graduated.  Frese's high octane Maryland program has also produced six \"Top Ten\" WNBA Draft Picks- Crystal Langhorne (2008), Laura Harper (2008), Marissa Coleman (2009), Kristi Toliver (2009), Tianna Hawkins (2012) and Alyssa Thomas (2014). Shay Doron was a 2nd round pick in the 2007 WNBA Draft- a remarkable accomplishment considering her final two college choices were Harvard and an at the time rebuilding Maryland program. Lynetta Kizer and Anjale Barrett were selected in the 2012 WNBA Draft.\n Frese coached Maryland's Terrapins to a 34\u20134 record during the 2006 season. The team finished the season by winning the 2006 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the final game, Maryland's Kristi Toliver tied the game with a jump shot over center Alison Bales with six seconds left, forcing Duke into overtime, and eventually led Maryland to a win by a score of 78\u201375. She is the fifth youngest women's coach to win a national championship.\n In October 2006, Frese and writer Chris King released a book chronicling the Terrapins' rise to their 2006 championship win entitled Overtime Is Our Time. The 200-page book, published by Terrapin State Publishing, earned acclaim by national TV basketball analyst Debbie Antonelli.\n The Terp women were ranked #1 in major preseason polls entering the 2006\u201307 season, a first for the program. They were also set to debut star Tennessee transfer Sa'de Wiley-Gatewood, who was unfortunately limited by tendinitis in both knees but still contributed on and off the court. The team, however, did not deliver a performance as stirring or convincing as in their championship year; they went 0\u20133 in the regular season against ACC rivals North Carolina and Duke, were eliminated by the Tar Heels in the ACC Tournament and were upset in the NCAA Tournament's round of 32 by Ole Miss. Maryland had beaten Ole Miss decisively during the regular season at a tournament in the Bahamas.\n Maryland spent much of the 2007\u201308 season ranked among the nation's top five teams and finished the season 33\u20134. The Terps advanced to the NCAA's Elite Eight, where they lost an entertaining, high-scoring affair to Stanford, 98\u201387. During the season, Coach Frese gave birth to twin boys- Markus William Thomas and Tyler Joseph Thomas- on February 17, 2008. That same day, Maryland won on the road at Duke, 76\u201369, giving Maryland a sweep of the regular season series. Maryland won the preseason WNIT, defeating LSU in the championship game, 75\u201362. Kristi Toliver won the Nancy Lieberman Award, which is given annually to the nation's top point guard. Crystal Langhorne was voted ACC Player of the Year. Both Langhorne and Toliver were named State Farm All-Americans. Langhorne and fellow senior Laura Harper were top 10 picks in the WNBA Draft.\n In 2008\u201309, after losing five seniors and dropping the season opener at Texas Christian University, Frese was able to coach the team to both the ACC Regular Season and Tournament championships, as well as an NCAA Elite Eight appearance and 31\u20135 record.  Kristi Toliver was named ACC Player of the Year, Marissa Coleman won ACC Tournament MVP and freshman Lynetta Kizer won ACC Rookie of the Year.  Coleman and Toliver were selected #2 and #3, respectively, overall in the '09 WNBA Draft.\n In 2010\u201311, Maryland bounced back from a year's absence from the NCAA Tournament with a fourth-place finish in the ACC regular season. The team had no seniors on its roster. Alyssa Thomas earned seven ACC Rookie of the Week honors and won ACC Rookie of the Year. Four freshmen under Frese have won the ACC's Rookie of the Year award (Langhorne, Coleman, Kizer and Thomas). Lynetta Kizer and Alyssa Thomas earned 2nd team All-ACC honors.\n Frese was previously married to Steven Oldfield from 1998 to 2002 and was known as Brenda Oldfield at the time.[4][5]\n Frese married Mark Thomas in 2005. In the 2007 offseason, Frese learned she was pregnant with twins. She gave birth to sons Markus William and Tyler Joseph on February 17, 2008.[6] Her youngest son was diagnosed with leukemia (ALL) on September 28, 2010.\n Frese's sister Marsha Frese is also a college basketball coach, having worked under Brenda Frese as an assistant at Ball State, Minnesota, and Maryland. In 2012, Marsha Frese became head coach at UMKC.[7]\n These assistant coaches or players under Frese later became head coaches:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National champion\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Postseason invitational champion\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conference regular season champion\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Division regular season champion\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conference tournament champion\n", " Sheldry P.

Canada, represented by the Ottawa RCAF Flyers team of Canadian Armed Forces personnel, won its fifth Olympic gold medal and 12th World Championship.  Highest finishing European team Czechoslovakia won the silver medal and its eighth European Championship.[1]\n The tournament was marred by controversy before the Games began.  The United States sent two hockey teams to compete in St. Moritz, which nearly caused the cancellation of the entire tournament.[2][3]  At the center of the issue was amateurism.[4]  One team was sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC).  The USOC was responsible for determining American participation in the Games.[4]  The other team was sponsored by the Amateur Hockey Association (AHA) and the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG).  The LIHG, under the guidance of founder Wilhelm \"Willie\" Bernfeld, was responsible for approving the participation of national hockey teams at the Olympics.[5]\n The AAU refused to support the AHA's team because they believed that AHA players were \"openly paid salaries\" and at the time, the Olympics were strictly for amateur players.[6] No resolution was reached before the Games and both teams arrived at St. Moritz ready to play.  This created a tense showdown between the future IOC president Avery Brundage, the LIHG, the Swiss organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).  The IOC was responsible for the overall running of the Games.  The IOC initially ruled that neither team could compete.  This incensed the LIHG, which threatened to boycott the Olympics, effectively ending the hockey tournament.[5]  The Swiss organizing committee, fearing this eventuality, ignored the IOC's ruling and allowed the AHA team to play in the tournament and the AAU team to march in the opening ceremony.\n Eventually the parties agreed to allow the AHA team to play but they would receive no official ranking in the Olympic tournament, and they would not be eligible to win a medal.[5]  Because this tournament was also the LIHG (forerunner of the IIHF) World Championship, they maintained a fourth place in that ranking.[7]\n The tournament was run in a round-robin format with nine teams participating.  The Canadians had seven wins and one tie against the team from Czechoslovakia.  Czechoslovakia also won seven games.  The tournament was decided on goal average.  Canada outscored their opponents 69:5 (a 13.8 goal average).  The Czechoslovakia team outscored their opponents 80:18 (a 4.44 goal average).  On the final day the Swiss watched the Czechoslovaks beat the Americans dashing their gold medal aspirations, and then lost their opportunity for silver in a loss to Canada, finishing with a bronze.[8]\n * United States team was not eligible for a final ranking.

It consists of three separate sites, 7S-F-11, 7S-F-12, and 7S-F-13.  These sites appear to have been semi-permanent seasonal settlements, occupied during the spring and fall, and abandoned for other hunting and fishing grounds in the summer and winter.  Finds at each site include both worked stone artifacts including projectile points, as well as different types of ceramics.  The combination of finds raises questions about the pattern of cultural migration in the area, which further investigation of the sites may shed light on.  Of the three sites, two have been subjected to surface-level collection, and one, 7S-F-13, has been subjected to more intensive excavations.[2]\n The sites were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[1]\n \n", " \n The United States Census of 1810 was the third Census conducted in the United States.

The original census returns for the District of Columbia, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Ohio were lost or destroyed over the years.[1] Most of Tennessee's original forms were also lost, other than Grainger and Rutherford counties.[2]\n This was the first census in which New York was ranked as the most populous state. It would occupy this spot for the next fifteen censuses, before being overtaken by California in 1970. This would also be the last census until 1860 in which Philadelphia was ranked as the second-most populous city.\n The 1810 Census form contained the following information (identical to the 1800 census):\n Census taking was not yet an exact science. Before 1830, enumerators lacked pre-printed forms, and some drew up their own, resulting in pages without headings. Some enumerators did not tally their results. As a result, census records for many towns before 1830 are idiosyncratic. This is not to suggest that they are less reliable than subsequent censuses, but that they may require more work on the part of the researcher.\n No microdata from the 1810 population census are available, but aggregate data for small areas, together with compatible cartographic boundary files, can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System.\n \n", " The Smith Shoe Shop is a historic ten-footer shoe workshop at 273 Haverhill Street in Reading, Massachusetts.

It is composed of approximately thirty students, alumni, and staff.  Orchesis offers its dancers lessons in performance quality, education in technique, and a chance for artistic growth.\n In the early twentieth century, the idea of women studying the art of dance or participating freely in an artistic experience was not widely accepted. Margaret H\u2019Doubler, however, created the first dance education program in the university system. Her legacy begins at the University of Wisconsin in the Physical Education Department.[1] H\u2019Doubler combined creative and scientific approaches to dance. She wanted to give the dancers on campus a chance to perform and eventually founded the \"Orchesis Dance Club\" in 1918.  The word \"orchesis,\" derived from the Greek word \"orchestra,\" means the art or act of dancing. This idea of a performing dance club spread through universities nationwide.\n The Orchesis Dance Company at Cal Poly was created by Dr. Moon Ja Minn Suhr. She received her schooling in Korea and graduated from Ewha Women\u2019s University [2]. She received her master's degree in Dance Education from The University of Northern Colorado and founded the Orchesis Dance Company at Cal Poly in the same year. In 1988, Dr. Suhr received her Ph.D. from Texas Women\u2019s University [3] in Dance and the Related Arts. Dr. Suhr directed the Orchesis Dance Company at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo from 1969 until 2000. She remains an avid supporter of the company and continues to teach in the Theatre and Dance Department. \n To become a member of the Orchesis Dance Company, one must audition due to the limited number of places in the company.  Auditions occur during the first week of Fall Quarter in the Moon Ja Minn Suhr Dance Studio (located by Crandall Gymnasium)[4].  Preparatory workshops are held that Tuesday and Wednesday, and the directors teach auditioning dancers a modern, jazz, and ballet combination. A panel of dance faculty from Cal Poly and the student interns watch groups of 3 perform these combinations.  Audition results are usually posted by midnight.\n Once members accept their invitation into the company, they are required to enroll into Dance 345: Choreography & Workshop in Dance Concert Preparation (4 units), and in Winter Quarter with Dance 346: Dance Production (also 4 units).  Both of these classes (345 and 346) include an activity (class) and a lab.  Although Orchesis is an ASI Club, it is also known as an academic organization because it is funded through the Instructionally Related Activities for the Theatre and Dance Department at Cal Poly.\n The Orchesis Dance Company performs in major styles of dance, including ballet, modern, contemporary, jazz, lyrical, and tap. Ballet is the basis of other styles and is a requirement for Orchesis members. Modern dance is any style that rejects traditional ballet training. Contemporary dance focuses on choreographic and performance processes. Jazz dance is more rhythmic and isolated than the other forms of dance. Lyrical dance is a fusion of ballet and jazz techniques and focuses on interpreting lyrics to a song, words of a poem, or the emotions of the dancer or choreographer. Tap dancing is connected to Scottish and Irish reels and African-American slave dances. It pays strict attention to rhythm.  All of these styles are featured in the Orchesis Dance Company Annual Concert. [5]\n Guest Artists Dennon and Sayhber Rawles, Davis Robertson, whose choreography was featured in Robert Altman\u2019s film The Company, has set modern ballet pieces for Orchesis members.

However, the Preservation Society ceased in 1922 while the League continued to thrive. \n In collaboration with the Bureau, the League distributed the funds and in-kind donations it raised for missions, mission schools and students. It built new missions and satellite chapels and maintained them with supplies; it trained and maintained catechists; and it provided scholarships to students and clothing to the needy. \n The League had a lay directorate of 25 members, chosen at first from among local councils of the St. Vincent de Paul Society. To further its work, it established branch organizations in several northeastern U.S. cities, including Baltimore and Washington, D.C.

The group is composed of Steffen Brandt, Hans Erik Lerchenfeld, Georg Olesen, and Sven Gaul. Having released 19 studio albums, four live albums and three compilations, they are one of the most commercially successful Danish bands of all time - according to the band's own sales figures, they have sold more than two million records[1].\n TV-2 was formed prior to the Danish television station TV 2, which began broadcasting in 1988.

Taurus changed their name to TV-2 in 1981, and begun singing in Danish at the same time. TV-2's success can be attributed to Steffen Brandt's songwriting, that often features ironic and satirical observations about the Danish middle class; making fun of its consumerism and conformity.[2] Some of their songs, such as Fantastiske Toyota (\"Fantastic Toyota\"), are known to have commercial like concepts, with satirical undertones. Because of the mundane nature of the songwriting, TV-2 used to refer jokingly to themselves as \"Denmark's most boring band\".\n In the beginning of their career, TV-2 played new wave pop music,[3] heavily influenced by Kraftwerk, Talking Heads and the Danish band Klich\u00e9, where Steffen Brandt briefly played keyboards. In the band's early years, the critical reception was negative, as TV-2 were unfavourably compared to Klich\u00e9,[4] but around the release of their third album Beat, music critics became more positive.[2] The band has cited Beat as a defining album, where the band found their own unique sound.[5]\n Over the years, TV-2's music has gone through several phases, including a more acoustic folk pop sound. In 2005, TV-2 had a major comeback with the hit single De f\u00f8rste k\u00e6rester p\u00e5 m\u00e5nen, where the group returned to their roots and played 1980s-styled new wave music once again.

He was exceedingly powerful early in the reign of Emperor Daizong and was said to, in his attempts to consolidate his power, have killed or demoted a number of key generals and officials on his own whim, and thus drew the hatred from the other officials and generals.  In 763, he was blamed for not warning Emperor Daizong about the Tubo invasion that eventually caused the capital Chang'an to fall to Tubo forces, forcing Emperor Daizong to flee.  Emperor Daizong exiled him, and he died in exile.\n Cheng Yuanzhen was from Jingzhao Municipality (\u4eac\u5146) -- the special municipality centered on the Tang capital Chang'an.  He was a eunuch from his youth and served at the eunuch bureau (\u5167\u4f8d\u7701, Neishi Sheng), eventually rising to be the commander of the imperial guard archer corps (\u5167\u5c04\u751f\u4f7f, Nei Shesheng Shi) as well as the deputy director of the imperial stables, under the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo, late in the reign of Emperor Suzong.\n In summer 762, Emperor Suzong was seriously ill, near death.  By this point, Emperor Suzong's wife Empress Zhang, who was previously allied with Li Fuguo, was no longer allied with him, and she tried to enter into an alliance with Emperor Suzong's son (not her son) the crown prince Li Yu, to kill Li Fuguo and Cheng Yuanzhen and seize power.  Li Yu declined, and she then entered into an alliance with Li Yu's younger brother Li Xi (\u674e\u4fc2) the Prince of Yue, trying to lay a trap for Li Fuguo (and possibly Li Yu).  When she issued an edict in Emperor Suzong's name summoning Li Yu, Cheng found out about her plan and detained Li Yu, escorting him to the imperial guard headquarters.  He and Li Fuguo then led troops into the palace and arrested Empress Zhang and Li Xi.  Upon Emperor Suzong's death, Li Fuguo executed Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and Li Xian (\u674e\u50e9) the Prince of Yan, and then declared Li Yu emperor (as Emperor Daizong).\n For two months early in Emperor Daizong's reign, Li Fuguo was exceedingly powerful, so much so that he was telling Emperor Daizong not to bother with any thing and just let him handle the matters of state, and Emperor Daizong gave him chancellor title, as well as several other honorific titles.  Cheng was made a commanding general of the imperial guards, but was not satisfied, as he wanted to take over Li Fuguo's power, and therefore he secretly plotted with Emperor Daizong.  With cooperation from Cheng, later in summer 762, Emperor Daizong, while creating Li Fuguo a prince, stripped Li Fuguo of his military command and transferred it to Cheng.  Li Fuguo was subsequently assassinated on Emperor Daizong's orders, and Emperor Daizong and Cheng governed together.\n It was said that Cheng was suspicious and jealous of the senior generals and officials and did what he could to strip them of power.  For example, he was jealous of Guo Ziyi and often criticized him before Emperor Daizong, leading Guo, who was fearful of the situation, to resign his command and remain at Chang'an.  When the senior official Pei Mian had disagreements with Cheng, Cheng had Pei demoted to the remote Shi Prefecture (\u65bd\u5dde, roughly modern Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei).  Meanwhile, he sometimes made requests of the general Lai Tian (\u4f86\u7471) -- the military governor (Jiedushi) of Shannan East Circuit (\u5c71\u5357\u6771\u9053, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), which Lai rejected, and thus he was resentful of Lai.  In 763, while Lai was at Chang'an, he and his associate Wang Zhongsheng (\u738b\u4ef2\u5347), who was also resentful of Lai, jointly falsely accused Lai of treason.  Lai was exiled and, on the way to exile, was ordered to commit suicide.  Cheng also disliked the major general Li Guangbi and often submitted reports against Li Guangbi.  The general Li Huairang (\u674e\u61f7\u8b93), the military governor of Tonghua Circuit (\u540c\u83ef, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), was also falsely accused by Cheng and committed suicide in fear in 763.  It was said that given these incidents, all of the generals felt insecure and alienated from the imperial government.  Despite this, Cheng was still arrogant and believed that he could grab more power.\n Throughout the spring and summer of 763, Tibetan, or Tubo, forces were progressively attacking and capturing Tang prefectures to the west of Chang'an.  It was said that despite the generals' urgent requests for aid, Cheng Yuanzhen did not relay the requests to Emperor Daizong.  By winter 763, Tibetan forces were approaching Chang'an; only then did Emperor Daizong realize the seriousness of the Tibetan threat and commission Guo Ziyi to resist the Tibetan Empire.  When Emperor Daizong issued an edict to the various circuits ordering emergency aid, however, the generals refused to respond, and Guo could not quickly gather troops large enough to resist Tibetan forces.  Emperor Daizong was forced to abandon Chang'an and flee to Shan Prefecture (\u965d\u5dde, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan).\n The imperial officials who followed Emperor Daizong to Shan Prefecture blamed the disaster on Cheng\u2014in both his failure to alert Emperor Daizong as to the seriousness of the Tibetan threat and his alienation of the generals, causing a lack of aid to arrive.  The imperial scholar Liu Kang (\u67f3\u4f09) submitted a harshly worded petition, asking that Cheng be executed.  Emperor Daizong, however, remembering how Cheng had protected him in the past, declined to do so.  He did, however, remove Cheng from his offices and order that he return home.\n When Emperor Daizong returned to Chang'an around the new year 764, Cheng heard the news.  Putting on women's clothing in disguise, he secretly entered Chang'an and plotted to return to power.[1]  He was arrested by the Jingzhao Municipality government, and the imperial censors subsequently submitted an indictment against him.  In spring 764, Emperor Daizong exiled him to Zhen Prefecture (\u699b\u5dde, in modern Chongqing), but soon changed the location of exile to the more prosperous city of Jiangling.  Cheng died there, in exile, shortly after arriving there.\n", " The Pallanca exotic gardens, which has a major collection of cactus and succulent plants of Europe, is at via Madonna della Ruota 1 in Bordighera, Liguria, Italy.\n In 1861, Giacomo Pallanca abandoned the traditional family business of olive production in Airole, to join the German botanist Ludwig Winter. Pallanca will then work with Winter for more than 20 years. During this period he also passed his passion to his son Bartolomeo who, from an early age, decided to work with his father and with Winter.\n In 1910, Bartolomeo Pallanca left Winter and established its own gardens of ornamental plants and flowers. There was an interruption during the war years, but Bartolomeo resumed its activity with the help of his son Giacomo and together they decided to specialize in succulent plants. The plant nursery quickly became a point of reference, and Pallanca will be asked to collaborate in the design of several gardens, including the Montju\u00efc park in  Barcelona and Trauttmansdorff gardens in Merano.[1]\n Since 1989, thanks to Barth, son of Giacomo Pallanca, the plant nursery, which continues its activities, has been open to the public.

The story was originally published in Strand Magazine in 1893, and was collected later in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Unlike the majority of Holmes stories, the main narrator is not Doctor Watson, but Sherlock Holmes himself. With Watson providing an introduction, the story within a story is a classic example of a frame tale. It is one of the earliest recorded cases investigated by Holmes, and establishes his problem solving skills.\n \"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\" shares elements with two Edgar Allan Poe tales: \"The Gold Bug\" and \"The Cask of Amontillado\".\n In 1927, Conan Doyle ranked the story at 11th place on his top 12 Holmes stories list.[1] The story did better in a 1959 chart produced by The Baker Street Journal, ranking 6th out of 10.[citation needed]\n In the story, Holmes recounts to Watson the events arising after a visit from a university acquaintance, Reginald Musgrave. Musgrave visits Holmes after the disappearance of two of his domestic staff, Rachel Howells, a maid, and Richard Brunton, the longtime butler. The pair vanished after Musgrave had dismissed Brunton for secretly reading a family document, the Musgrave Ritual. The Ritual, which dates from the 17th century, is a riddle set in question/response form. It reads:\n Whose was it?'\n'His who is gone.'\n'Who shall have it?'\n'He who will come.'\n('What was the month?'\n'The sixth from the first.')[2]\n'Where was the sun?'\n'Over the oak.'\n'Where was the shadow?'\n'Under the elm.'\n'How was it stepped?'\n'North by ten and by ten, east by five and by five, south by two and by two, west by one and by one, and so under.'\n'What shall we give for it?'\n'All that is ours.'\n'Why should we give it?'\n'For the sake of the trust.\n Musgrave caught Brunton in the library at two o'clock one morning. Not only had he unlocked a cabinet and taken out the document in question, but he also had what looked like a chart or map, which he promptly stuffed into a pocket upon seeing his employer watching him. Brunton besought Musgrave not to dishonour him by dismissing him, and asked for a month's time to invent some reason for leaving, making it seem as though he was leaving of his own accord. Musgrave granted him a week. The story later reveals that Brunton wanted the time for something else.\n A few days later, Brunton disappeared, leaving behind most of his belongings. His bed had not been slept in. No sign could be found of him. The maid, Rachel Howells, who was also Brunton's former lover, had a hysterical fit when asked about Brunton's whereabouts, repeating over and over that he was gone. She was in such a state that another servant was posted to sit up with her at night. Eventually, however, the guarding servant nodded off one night, and the hysterical Rachel Howells escaped through a window. Her footprints led to the edge of the mere, and ended there. Musgrave had the mere dredged, but only a sack containing some rusty, mangled bits of metal, and some coloured stones or glass were found. Rachel Howells was never heard from again.\n Holmes looked upon the case not as three mysteries, but as one. He considered the riddle of the ritual. It was a meaningless, absurd tradition to Musgrave, and apparently to all his ancestors going back more than two centuries, but Holmes \u2013 and Brunton, too, Holmes suspected \u2013 saw it as something very different. He quickly realized that it was a set of instructions for finding something. Ascertaining the height of the oak, which was still standing, and the position of the elm, which was now gone, Holmes performed a few calculations and paced out the route to whatever awaited him, with Musgrave now eagerly following him.\n It was quite instructive to Holmes that Brunton had recently asked about the old elm tree's height as well, and that he was apparently quite intelligent.\n The two men found themselves inside a doorway, momentarily disappointed, until they realized that there was the last instruction, \"and so under\". There was a cellar under where they were standing, as old as the house. Finding their way into it, they saw that the floor had been cleared to expose a stone slab with an iron ring on it. Holmes thought it wise to bring the police in at this point. He and a burly Sussex policeman managed to lift the slab off the little hole that it was covering, and inside, they found an empty, rotten chest, and Brunton, who had been dead for several days. There were no marks on him. He had likely suffocated.\n Holmes then put everything together for his rather shocked client. Brunton had deduced the ritual's meaning, at least insofar as it led to something valuable. He had determined the elm tree's height by asking his master, had paced out the instructions \u2013 and Holmes had later even found a peg hole in the lawn made by Brunton \u2013 had found the hiding place in the old cellar, but then had found it impossible to lift the stone slab himself. So, he had been forced to draw someone else into his treasure hunt. He had unwisely chosen Rachel Howells, who hated him. The two of them could have lifted the slab up, but they would have needed to support it while Brunton climbed down to fetch the treasure. Based on Rachel's sudden flight and disappearance, Holmes wondered if she had deliberately kicked the supports away and left Brunton to die, or if the slab had fallen back into place by itself and caused her to panic.\n As to the relics found in the bag retrieved from the mere, Holmes examined them and found that the metal parts were gold and the stones were gems. He believed that it was no less than King Charles\u00a0I\u2019s (\"His who is gone\") gold crown, being kept for his eventual successor \u2013 his son, Charles\u00a0II, (\"He who will come\") who would not be crowned until 11\u00a0years after the execution of Charles\u00a0I. The ritual had been a guide to retrieving this important symbol, and Reginald confirms that one of his ancestors, Sir Ralph Musgrave, was a king's man. Holmes theorized that the original holder of the ritual had died before teaching his son about its significance. It had thus become nothing more than a quaint custom for more than 200\u00a0years.\n The story was originally published in the Strand Magazine in May 1893, with illustrations by Sidney Paget. It was later collected in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. The Strand's text of the ritual did not specify the month in which the shadow of the oak should be measured (the shadow would be longer in winter), but a couplet was added for the Memoirs identifying the month as the \"sixth from the first\".[3]\n A French silent film, Le Tr\u00e9sor des Musgraves.\n T. S. Eliot stated that he adapted part of the Ritual in his 1935 verse play Murder in the Cathedral as a deliberate homage.[3]\n The 1943 film Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, part of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce series of films, loosely adapted the story, though the ritual was completely re-written to represent a chess game played on the floor of the Musgrave mansion. Also the treasure is a land grant that was given to the Musgraves by Henry VIII instead of the lost crown of Charles I.\n The story was adapted for the 1965 BBC series Sherlock Holmes with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.[4]\n The story was adapted for an episode of Sherlock Holmes, the Granada Television series starring Jeremy Brett. The episode deviated from the original by including Watson in the adventure; the story nods to the framing device of the original by having Holmes, not looking forward to the trip, remark that he intends to organise some of his old cases before he met Watson in order to keep himself occupied. In addition, the story features an actual oak tree, which Holmes describes as \"a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen.\" In the Granada film version, however, Holmes utilizes a weathervane in the shape of an oak perched on top of the Musgrave mansion to solve the mysterious ritual. At the very end of the teleplay, Rachel's body is shown to have been found after having floated up from the mere. Further, the 12th line of the ritual is adapted to suit the scenery and the 5th and 6th lines are omitted. It was filmed in the 400-year-old Baddesley Clinton Manor House near Birmingham, UK. This house was the Musgrave home in the TV episode.\n \"The Musgrave Ritual\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 as part of Bert Coules' complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Robert Daws as Reginald Musgrave and Michael Kilgarriff as Sergeant Harris.[5]\n Episodes 9 and 10 of the 2013 Russian TV series Sherlock Holmes are based on the story, although the storyline is quite different including some action scenes and Brunton being in fact a revenging member of a family of Musgraves' rivals.\n The Musgrave Ritual is adapted as part of the storyline of the final episode of the fourth season of Sherlock, \"The Final Problem\"; as children, the Holmes family lived in an old house called Musgrave, but after Sherlock and Mycroft's sister Eurus was involved in the disappearance of Sherlock's dog/best friend (Sherlock had for years believed it was a dog as he buried the memory due to the scale of the mental trauma), all Eurus would provide as a clue was a strange song. Years later, with John Watson's life at stake as he is trapped in the same location where Eurus left her first victim, Sherlock deduces that the song relates to the unusual dates on various fake gravestones around the house, the resulting 'code' leading him to Eurus' old room to make an emotional appeal to his sister to spare John.\n \n", " The 1990 congressional elections in Maryland were held on November 6, 1990, to determine who will represent the state of Maryland in the United States House of Representatives.

With the merger between the University of Ballarat and Monash University's Gippsland campus in 2013, the university changed its name to Federation University from 2014.[3][4][5]\n Tertiary education at Ballarat began in 1870, making it Australia's fourth oldest tertiary institution.[6]\n On 6 September 2013, the Victorian Parliament passed legislation to establish Federation University Australia,[7] The name change officially began in 2014. The then Vice-Chancellor justified the name change as an attempt to broaden the reach of the university nationally and internationally, and in fairness to the campuses outside Ballarat.[8] The name was also the preferred name within the university, compared to 'State University of Victoria', 'Eureka University', 'Robert Menzies University' or 'Vida Goldstein University'.\n The former Ballarat Gaol, which was a maximum security prison that operated from 1862 until 1965, was located on the site of the university's School of Mines (SMB) campus, at the southern end of Lydiard Street. The area is known for being a well preserved Victorian era street.[9] While the prison was mostly demolished in the 1960s, the old prison walls, gate and guard towers, as well as the residences of the governor and warden, still exist. The Collaborative Research Centre in Australian History (CRCAH) is located in the governor's residence of the Old Ballarat Gaol. The CRCAH director's office was once the bedroom of Bella Guerin, who became the first woman to graduate from an Australian university in 1883.[10] The campus also includes the old School of Mines buildings.\n Students can undertake undergraduate degrees across a wide range of study areas, which are:\n Researchers - academics and post-graduate students - undertake work within various centres, as well as within the disciplines. The research priority areas of the university are information forensics and security, transformative and preventative health, dynamic landscapes, history and heritage, and improving policy and practice in VET. The research centres are:\n There are also research facilities at Ballarat Technology Park, the Gippsland Enterprise Centre and Nanya Station in rural NSW.\n In 2017, FedUni was ranked within the top 20% of Australian universities in humanities for teaching quality, learner engagement, learning resources, skills development, and student support.[14] Nationally, the university is ranked 31 in Australia (out of 40).[15] Across the university, for postgraduate research the university is rated above the national average by former students with 78.8% satisfaction. For undergraduate studies, the university is rated above national average by former students with 83.3% satisfaction.[16]\n Historically, the former University of Ballarat achieved a maximum five-star rating for teaching quality in the Good Universities Guide consecutively from 2010 to 2014. FedUni has been ranked four-stars for graduate placement by the Good Universities Guide, but is not ranked in international university guides.[17] This placed the University in the top tier of Australian regional universities.\n In 2017, 80% of undergraduate students study full-time and on campus, which is unique for a regional university, and 35% of students are international students.[18]\n In addition to the following campuses, the university also had joint-degree programmes with international colleges, including PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College in Hong Kong.\n Online learning:\nFederation university offers many courses through online study. This consists of online reading materials, online virtual classes, online quizzes and weekly course activities.    \n Located in Mount Helen, 10\u00a0km south of Ballarat. The university's largest campus, it has two residences, Peter Lalor Hall and Bella Guerin Hall. Its programs include the School of Education and Arts; School of Health Sciences; School of Science, Information Technology and Engineering; and the Business School.\n The Gippsland Campus is located in the township of Churchill in the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges. The campus is home to over 2,500 students and approximately 400 staff\n The campus was formerly Monash University, Gippsland campus, but became part of Federation University Australia on 1 January 2014.\n Gippsland campus has a childcare centre just like other campuses. The childcare centre was formally known as Pooh Corner childcare centre, but now FedUni Children Centre.\n The Berwick Campus is located in Berwick and is the newest of Federation University's campuses. It was transitioning itself from the Monash University, Berwick campus in 2017 and completed its transition in early 2018. The exact location of the building is 100 Clyde Road Berwick VIC 3806. The university has three buildings naming 901, 902 and 903.\n The university has a technology park with the mission to facilitate the development of technology-based companies or companies that benefit from the technological resources of the university.[19] The following organisations operate in the park.\n More than 1350 people are employed by tenants at the technology park and approximately half of those holding Federation University Australia qualifications.

It was formally established in 2003 in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 to oversee national security programs and the newly created Department of Homeland Security. The United States Senate Committee on Appropriations has joint jurisdiction with the United States House Committee on Appropriations over all appropriations bills in the United States Congress.[1] Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees, each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills.\n Traditionally, after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed, the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings.[2] This is called \"302(b) allocations\" after section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees. The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President. Instead, it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions.[2] However, no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one.[2] The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.[2]\n An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities.[1] Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year.[3]\n There are three types of appropriations bills: regular appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental appropriations bills.[1] Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1.[4] If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time.[1] The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief.[5]\n Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. Article One of the United States Constitution, section 9, clause 7, states that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.[1]\n The subcommittee is responsible for the Department of Homeland Security and its related agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the U.S. Secret Service, and the United States Coast Guard.  The subcommittee also provides funding for state and local preparedness efforts.\n", " \nSir George Francis Hill KCB (22 December 1867 \u2013 18 October 1948) was the director and principal librarian of the British Museum (1931\u20131936).[1] He was a specialist in Renaissance  medals.\n George Hill was born in Baharampur, India. His grandfather, Micaiah Hill, founded the London Missionary Society's outpost there and his father, Samuel John Hill, was stationed where George was born.  He attended Blackheath College (later known as  Eltham College) followed by University College, London, and finally Merton College, Oxford.[2] He studied under Percy Gardner at Merton, taking a first class degree in classics.[2] There he also gained an interest in numismatics. He was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1915.[3]\n In 1893, Hill joined the British Museum in the Coins and Medals Department.  At that time, the department was the centre of study of Greek coins. Hill continued the work of Barclay Head and Reginald Poole; in 1897 was published the first volume of a catalogue of Greek coins. Hill subsequently produced catalogues of many of the British Museum's collections in his area. In 1912, he became keeper of the department.[2] In 1931, he was appointed Director and Principal Librarian of the British Museum.[2] Whilst director, he purchased the Codex Sinaiticus from the Soviet Union and, with the Victoria and Albert Museum, the George Eumorfopoulos oriental antiquities collection.\n Hill was editor of the Journal of Hellenic Studies from 1898 to 1912. He was knighted in 1933.[2]\n In 1897, he married Mary Paul, whose parents lived in Rome, Italy.\nHe retired in 1936 and died in London in 1948.[4][5]\n", " A carbon print is a photographic print with an image consisting of pigmented gelatin, rather than of silver or other metallic particles suspended in a uniform layer of gelatin, as in typical black-and-white prints, or of chromogenic dyes, as in typical photographic color prints.\n In the original version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a temporary support sheet coated with a layer of gelatin mixed with a pigment\u2014originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional silver bromide paper print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.\n The process can produce images of very high quality which are exceptionally resistant to fading and other deterioration. It was developed in the mid-19th century in response to concerns about the fading of early types of silver-based black-and-white prints, which was already becoming apparent within a relatively few years of their introduction.\n The most recent development in the process was made by the American photographer Charles Berger in 1993 with the introduction of a non-toxic sensitizer that presented none of the health and safety hazards of the toxic (now EU-restricted) dichromate sensitizer.\n Carbon tissue, a layer of unsensitized pigmented gelatin on a thin paper support sheet,[1] was introduced by British physicist and chemist Joseph Swan[2][3] in 1864.[4] Marketing began in 1866. Initially, his ready-made tissues were sold in only three colors: black, sepia and purple-brown.[1][3] Eventually, a wide array of hues became available. Carbon tissue was a stock item in Europe and the US well into the 20th century,[1] but by the 1950s carbon printing was very rare and supplies for it became an exotic specialty item. Some companies produced small quantities of carbon tissue and transfer papers for monochrome and three-color work until around 1990.[1][3]\n The carbon process, initially a black-and-white process using lampblack (carbon black), was invented by Alphonse Poitevin in 1855. The process was later adapted to color, through the use of pigments, by Louis Ducos du Hauron in 1868. Carbon printing remained commercially popular through the first half of the 20th century. It was replaced over time by the dye-transfer process, chromogenic, dye-bleach (or dye destruction, i.e. Cibachrome) and, now, digital printing processes. The efficiencies gained through these more modern automated processes relegated carbon printing to the commercial backwaters in the latter half of the 20th century. It is now only found in the darkrooms of the rare enthusiast and a few exotic labs.\n Carbon printing is based on the fact that gelatin, when sensitized to light by a dichromate, is hardened and made insoluble in water when exposed to ultraviolet light. Because of the comparative insensitivity of the material, sunlight or another strong source of UV light is normally used to minimize the required exposure time. To make a full-color print, three negatives photographed through red, green and blue filters are printed on dichromate-sensitized sheets of pigmented gelatin (traditionally called \"carbon tissue\" regardless of the pigment incorporated) containing, respectively, cyan, magenta and yellow pigments. They are developed in warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin, leaving a colored relief image that is thickest where it received the strongest exposure. The three images are then transferred, one at a time, onto a final support such as a heavy sheet of smooth gelatin-sized paper. Usually, the yellow image is transferred first, then the magenta image is applied on top of it, great care being taken to superimpose it in exact register, and then the cyan image is similarly applied. A fourth black pigment \"key\" layer is sometimes added, as in mechanical printing processes, to improve edge definition and mask any spurious color cast in the dark areas of the image, but it is not a traditional component.\n The resulting finished print, whether composed of several layers and in full color or having only a single monochrome layer, exhibits a very slight bas-relief effect and a variation of texture on its surface, both distinctive characteristics of a carbon print. The process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Each color carbon print requires three, or four, round trips in the darkroom to create the finished print. An individual, using existing pigmented sheets and separations, can prepare, print and process enough material, 60 sheets including the support, to produce about twelve 20\" x 24\" four-color prints in a 40-hour work week. However, this investment of time and effort can create prints of outstanding visual quality and proven archival permanence.\n The carbon process can be used to produce:\n Any combination of layers, in any color, is possible to achieve whatever ends the printer desires.\nThere are two primary techniques used in carbon printing: single transfer and double transfer. This has to do with the negatives (separations) being right- or wrong-reading and the image \"flopping\" during the transfer process.\n Because the carbon printing process uses pigments instead of dyes, it is capable of producing a far more archivally stable (permanent) print than any of the other color processes. Good examples of the color stability of pigments can be found in the paintings of the great masters, the true colors of which, in many cases, have survived all these centuries. A more contemporary example of the color stability of pigments is found in the paints used on automobiles today, which must survive intense daily exposure to very harsh lighting, under extreme conditions. The useful life of many (but not all) pigment formulations has been projected out to be several centuries and beyond (perhaps millennia, if cave paintings of Lascaux, the wall paintings in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings and the frescoes of Pompeii are relevant examples), often being limited only to the useful life of the particular support used. Additionally, the use of pigment also produces a wider color gamut than any of the other color processes, allowing for a greater range and subtlety of color reproduction.\n Though carbon printing always has been, and remains, a labor-intensive, time consuming and technologically demanding process, there are still those that prefer the high aesthetic of its remarkable beauty and longevity over all other processes.\n Chronological History of Carbon (Pigment) Printing\n", " Krzywop\u0142oty [k\u0282\u0268v\u0254\u02c8pw\u0254t\u0268] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Klucze, within Olkusz County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland.

It was built at the behest of Ivan the Terrible on the ruins of the former castle of Kazan khans. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000.\n The Kazan Kremlin includes many old buildings, the oldest of which is the Annunciation Cathedral (1554\u201462), the only 16th-century Russian church to have six piers and five apses. Like many of Kazan's buildings of the period, it is constructed of local pale sandstone rather than of brick. The renowned Pskov architects Postnik Yakovlev and Ivan Shirjay (called Barma) were invited by the Tzar to rebuild the Kazan Kremlin in stone. The cathedral bell tower was erected in five tiers at the urging of Ivan the Terrible and was scored to resemble the Ivan the Great Belltower in Moscow, but was pulled down by the Soviets in 1930.\n The most conspicuous landmark of the Kazan Kremlin is the leaning S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower, which probably goes back to the reign of Peter the Great.

Another recognizable architectural feature is the Spasskaya Tower, which anchors the southern end of the Kremlin and serves as the main entrance to the Kremlin. \n The Spasskaya Tower is named after the Spassky Monastery, which used to be located nearby. Among the monastery's buildings were the Church of St. Nicholas (1560s, four piers) and the Cathedral of the Saviour's Transfiguration (1590s, six piers). They were destroyed by the Communists during Joseph Stalin's rule.\n Also of interest are snow-white towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later renovated; the Qol-\u015e\u00e4rif mosque, recently rebuilt inside the citadel; and the Governor's House (1843\u201453), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan. The Palace is believed to be located on the site of a former Khan's palace. Tucked between Presidential Palace and S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower is the palace church built on the foundation of a medieval mosque.\n The Northern wall of the Kremlin contains another gated tower, Secret Tower, so named because it used to house a secret water supply well. This tower allows pedestrian access to the Kremlin, but vehicle access is restricted to emergencies only.\n The opening of one of the biggest mosques in Europe, the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif Mosque, was held in Kazan on June 24, 2005. Roughly 17,000 people gathered for the celebration. Delegations from forty countries attended the event. The facility was reconstructed on the site where presumably Kazan Khanate's principal mosque had been standing before 1552. Speaking at the ceremony, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaeymiev said \"the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif mosque is a new symbol of Kazan and Tatarstan... a bridge connecting... our past and future.\" \n The decree on restoring the Qol\u015f\u00e4rif mosque (1995) also ordered the restoration of the Annunciation Cathedral in the Kazan Kremlin which had been taken away from Orthodox Christians after the Russian Revolution. On July 21, 2005, the feast day of the holy icon \"Theotokos of Kazan\", in the presence of the crowd of 10,000 pilgrims, Patriarch Alexius II and Mintimer Shaeymiev placed at the newly restored Annunciation Cathedral the holiest copy of the long-lost icon, which had been returned to Russia in 2004 by Pope John Paul II shortly before his death.\n In 2005 the first stage of the Kazan Metro also included a station named Kremlyovskaya (or Kreml in Tatar), whose exits are right next to the Kremlin.\n The S\u00f6yembik\u00e4 Tower of the Kazan Kremlin\n The Transfiguration tower of the Kazan Kremlin\n The Taynitskaya tower of the Kazan Kremlin\n Spasskaya Tower\n The northern housing of the Artillery Court\n The eastern wall of the Kazan Kremlin\n The Governor's Palace / Presidential palace\n A skyline of Kazan Kremlin\n Tombs of Khans of the Khanate of Kazan\n Kazan Kreml' in 1839\n Kazan Kreml' in 1911\n Kazan Kreml' House church\n Saviour-Transfiguration monastery in 19th century\n An inside view of the Kazan Kreml' in early 20th century\n The southern housing of the Artillery Court\n Coordinates: 55\u00b048\u203200\u2033N 49\u00b006\u203220\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff55.80000\u00b0N 49.10556\u00b0E\ufeff / 55.80000; 49.10556\n", " Cornelius is an unincorporated community in Jackson Township, Brown County, Indiana.\n A post office was established at Cornelius in 1893, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1907.[3] Cornelius was the name of a pioneer settler.[4]\n Cornelius is located at 39\u00b017\u203259\u2033N 86\u00b017\u203253\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff39.29972\u00b0N 86.29806\u00b0W\ufeff / 39.29972; -86.29806.\n \n", " Ricardo Gaitan and Alberto Gaitan, are musical producers, singers, songwriters and music arrangers.[1]\n From their native Panama, they begin their careers in 1989, forming their first group, named Impakto (Impact), under the direction of their father Dicky Gait\u00e1n, and under the management of their mother Dalys.

He was educated by his father at Bradford, Yorkshire, under Christopher Ness, and then at Appleby grammar school.[1]\n Smith was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge on 12 June 1674 as a sizar, graduating B.A. 1677, and M.A. 1681.[2] On leaving he was ordained deacon and priest by Archbishop Richard Sterne; in July 1682 he was admitted a minor canon of Durham Cathedral, was shortly afterwards collated to the curacy of Croxdale, and on 1 July 1684 to that of Witton Gilbert. From 1686 to 1689 he acted as chaplain to Lord Lansdown, the English ambassador at Madrid. In 1694 he was appointed domestic chaplain to Nathaniel Crew, who in the following year collated him to the rectory and hospital of Gateshead, and on 25 September 1695 to the seventh prebendal stall in Durham Cathedral.[1]\n In 1696 Smith was created D.D. at Cambridge, and three years later was made treasurer of Durham, to which the bishop added in July 1704 the rectory of Bishop-Wearmouth. Here he rebuilt the rectory and restored the chancel of the church, but  In 1713 his health began to fail, and he died at Cambridge on 30 July 1715. He was buried in the chapel of St John's College, where a monument was erected, with an inscription by his friend Thomas Baker.[1]\n Smith undertook his major work, an edition of Bede's Historia, under the influence of Thomas Gale, encouraged by Ralph Thoresby, and with assistance of Humfrey Wanley on Old English.[3][4] He spent the majority of his time residing in Cambridge, and working on it, but did not live to complete the preparation. His son George brought out in 1722 the Histori\u00e6 Ecclesiastic\u00e6 Gentis Anglorum Libri Quinque, auctore Venerabili B\u00e6da \u2026 cura et studio Johannis Smith, S. T. P., Cambridge University Press.[1]\n This edition is described by David C. Douglas as \"an enormous advance\" on previous ones, adding that textual criticism of Bede hardly then changed until 1896, when the Christopher Plummer edition appeared.[5] He also calls Smith one of \"the founders of English medieval scholarship\".[6] It contains also the preface to The Reckoning of Time, and a world-chronicle.[7] It also had the Old English version of the Historia ecclesiastica.[8]\n Smith also furnished materials for Edmund Gibson's edition of William Camden, and to James Anderson for his Historical Essay in 1705.[1]\n Smith married in 1692 Mary, eldest daughter of William Cooper of Scarborough, who gave his daughter a portion of \u00a34,500; they had, with four other sons, George Smith the nonjuror.[1]\n \u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Lee, Sidney, ed.

The site, donated by fonnese Don Stefano Melis, was located in the district Logotza of the \"villa\" of Fonni belonging to the fief of Mandas. On the front of the church is still visible above the main door, the emblem of the noble family: an apple tree bearing fruit.\n The convent and church, dedicated to the Blessed Trinity, was completed after several interruptions around 1632-33. The plan of the church was very simple: a large single barrel vault room, with three chapels on each side and the presbytery where is the picture of Antonio Todde depicting the Trinity. Attached was the classic facility of the Franciscan convent: a quadrilateral cell overlooking the cloister and the central well.\n In 1702, after the demolition of the chapel of the Rosarya new edifice  dedicated to the Virgin of the Martyrs was begun, which is annexed the one dedicated to the Trinity. The project was completed in October 1706.\n The chapel-church is comprised by a space covered with a barrel vault on which overlook two semicircular chapels. The raised presbytery structure concludes with the altar that houses Our Lady of Martyrs. At the chapel, on a high drum was structured a windowed octagonal cupola. The lavish sculptural decoration of the basilica is adorned by paintings by Pietro Antonio and Gregorio Are (father and son).\n The underground sanctuary dedicated to St. Gregory the Great is divided into two rooms that were originally separated by an iron gate: the vestibule and the sanctuary. In the first, a rectangular room with  barrel vault, five niches per side house busts of saints connected with the Franciscan tradition. In the second room, also  rectangular and barrel vaulted, various altars and images in polychrome stucco.

Until 30 September 2015, it was also home to A Flight, No. 202 Squadron RAF, who flew the Westland Sea King HAR.3 in the SAR (Search and Rescue) role.\n In 1940 a decoy airfield was set up near the village of Boulmer to divert German attacks from nearby Royal Air Force (RAF) airfields such as RAF Acklington. As the air threat to the United Kingdom receded, the decoy airfield, with its grass runways and plywood and canvas Hurricanes, was abandoned.  In March 1943 RAF Boulmer was re-opened as a satellite airfield to house the advanced flights of No. 57 Operational Training Unit RAF (a Supermarine Spitfire training unit based at RAF Eshott, Boulmer's parent unit).[1] During this period, there were three tarmac runways and a unit of the RAF Regiment defended the Station.  In November 1943 RAF Boulmer became home to No 9 Battle Training School, in which night flying, dive-bombing, strafing, bouncer, and chase tactics were taught.  As the war ended the airfield closed, reverting to agricultural use.[2]  Part of the airfield formed the basis of a caravan site with the runway and taxiway being used as an access road to the site.  The site remains and is called Seaton Park.\n By 1950, the threat of the Atomic bomb had caused a serious rethink in the organisation of air defence and a plan, codenamed ROTOR, was brought in to replace many of the existing stations with new protected underground operations rooms. The site chosen for one of these new underground Ground-controlled interception (GCI) stations was close to the former RAF Boulmer which had been returned to agriculture at the end of the Second World War.\n The station was to have a two level underground operations room designated as an R3. The R3 was never intended to survive a direct hit from a nuclear weapon but was designed to withstand a near miss from Russian bombing with 2,200\u00a0lb armour-piercing high explosive bombs dropped from 35,000 feet.\n A target date for completion of the station was set as 21 August 1953 and although not complete, the station opened on time with limited capabilities using an American AN/FPS3 long-range search radar and an AN/TPS10 height finder. The station became known as 500 Signals Unit under the control of RAF Acklington and part of 13 Group - the station motto 'Semper in excubitu vigilans' is taken from 500 Signals Unit Badge.[3] On completion of the R3 in September 1954 the station became fully operational and RAF Boulmer became an independent unit for the first time.\n In the autumn of 1957 RAF Boulmer was designated a Group Control Centre, with responsibility for the RAF Radar Stations at Buchan and Killard Point. By 1958, Boulmer was selected to be upgraded with the installation of the more modern high powered Type 84 Surveillance radar. This increased the range of detection and was able to penetrate the latest Soviet jamming technology.\n In 1971 Border Radar was established at Boulmer, this was a joint military/civil facility providing air traffic control services to co-ordinate civil and military traffic. Although still operational until the late 1980s, the unit closed when all Area Air Traffic Services were centralised between West Drayton and Prestwick.\n By 1974 the Station had evolved to become both a Sector Operations Centre (SOC) and Control and Reporting Centre (CRC). During this time, fighter controllers from Boulmer routinely detected Soviet aircraft probing the UK Air Defence Region and scrambled Quick Reaction Alert aircraft to intercept them before they reached UK airspace.\n In 1978 RAF Boulmer took on a new additional role as a search and rescue station following the closure of RAF Acklington,[1] a role that it fulfilled until 30 September 2015. Initially the station was equipped with Westland Whirlwind helicopters however in December 1978 the station was re-equipped with the more capable Westland Sea King aircraft.\n The next major change came in 1982 when the R3 bunker was vacated and work begun to upgrade it to an R3A. During this period the CRC was relocated to an above ground facility while the work was carried out.\n In 1990, Boulmer's links with Air Defence was reinforced by the arrival of the School of Fighter Control from RAF West Drayton. Following an extensive refurbishment the bunker was returned to operations in 1993. However, with the end of the Cold War the CRC was used in a standby role only with the homeland defence task being conducted from RAF Buchan and RAF Neatishead.\n In 1994 No 1 Air Control Centre (No 1 ACC) reformed at RAF Boulmer, providing the Royal Air Force with a highly capable, rapidly deployable fielded air command and control capability.  Later equipped with BAE Systems Type 101 Air Defence Radars, they played a key role in Operation TELIC following the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq.\n In 2002, the Station began a major refurbishment of the underground bunker and installation of new equipment as part of the UKADGE Capability Maintenance Programme (UCMP).  Valued at \u00a360 million, the first phase of the programme was declared operational at RAF Boulmer on 16 August 2004.\n In 2004 RAF Boulmer's newly refurbished NATO Control Reporting Centre (CRC) took over all air defence functions previously administered by the CRCs at RAF Buchan and RAF Neatishead.  As the main CRC in the UK, Boulmer has responsibility for 24-hour surveillance of the UK's airspace, as well as liaison with NATO allies around Europe, to maintain an effective air defence cover for NATO's Air Policing Area 1.\n On 1 September 2004 it also assumed responsibility, in addition to the Type 93 radar at RRH Brizlee Wood (9 miles west of the Boulmer) for the Type 92 radars at RAF Buchan and RAF Benbecula.\n In late July 2004 it was announced that RAF Boulmer would close by 2012, with the majority of its functions transferring to RAF Scampton.  The first action taken in response to this announcement was for No 1 ACC to move to RAF Kirton in Lindsey, a former RAF Fighter Command airfield in Lincolnshire.  This would bring the Air Command and Control elements of the Air Surveillance and Control System (ASACS) (the new CRC at RAF Scampton) geographically closer to the ISTAR elements such as the E3 Sentry AWACS force at RAF Waddington. No 1 ACC's move to Kirton was completed in early 2005.  Later that same year, a review was announced into the decision to close Boulmer.\n On 10 January 2008 it was announced that a study had been conducted into where to locate the elements of the Air Surveillance and Control System (ASACS).  The results concluded that the best option in both financial and operational terms is to retain RAF Boulmer as the ASACS hub and as a result the station would stay open beyond 2012.[4]\n 'A' Flight was one of the three operational flights of No. 202 Squadron RAF and was based at RAF Boulmer. The flight was commanded by a Squadron Leader and consisted of approximately 20 aircrew, 30 engineers and 8 support staff.  Using the ageing \u2013 but highly capable \u2013 Sea King HAR.3 helicopter, 'A' Flight provided round-the-clock search and rescue cover for a large area, stretching from Fife in the north to Hartlepool in the south and encompassing the Lake District in the west.  The eastern boundary was very fluid with flights having been known to end up in Norway following a rescue. \n On 30 September 2015 'A' Flight of No. 202 Squadron departed RAF Boulmer and the provision of SAR from RAF Boulmer ceased. SAR is now delivered by HM Coastguard through a contract with Bristow Helicopters.[5]\n The following notable flying and non-flying units are based at RAF Boulmer.[6]\n No. 11 Group (Multi-domain Operations) RAF\n RAF Boulmer's mission statement is to 'generate and sustain an operationally agile air command and control capability.'[7]\n Homeland defence of the UK, remains the cornerstone of the ASACS Force Command's operational output. However, the ASACS Force Command also has a wider responsibility in support of deployed operations worldwide. With the stand up of the ASACS Force Command Headquarters at RAF Boulmer in January 2006, the Station Commander also has the operational role of ASACS Force Commander responsible for the generation, sustainment and operational output of the ASACS organisation.According to the Daily Telegraph, there were 187 interceptions between 2005 and 2016. The work is now shared between Boulmer and RAF Scampton.[8]\n The Force Elements under the control of the ASACS Force Commander are:\n Although not Force Elements, the School of Aerospace Battle Management and Support Wing at RAF Boulmer are vital cogs in the machinery of the Command, without which the ASACS Force could not generate its capability. In total, the ASACS Force Command comprises some 1800 military personnel, civil servants and contracted staff.[10]\n The Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) at RAF Boulmer is tasked with compiling a Recognised Air Picture within NATO Air Policing Area 1, and providing tactical control of the Quick Reaction Alert Force. The CRC also supports the training of students undergoing training at the School of Aerospace Battle Management and controls military aircraft on routine training missions. Furthermore, the CRC provides trained personnel for out of area operations, currently ranging from The Falkland Islands to the Middle East. The unit also provides the UK's tactical control facility for the combat training of air defence, ground attack and air-to-air refuelling aircraft and participates daily in Joint training with the Royal Navy, exchanging air picture information by both digital data link and voice nets with ships at sea.\n During the summer of 2004, following the closure of CRC Neatishead in Norfolk, completion of the refurbishment of the underground bunker at RAF Boulmer marked the arrival of over 250 personnel to man the Unit. Following operational assessment of the new equipment, CRC Boulmer assumed 24/7 operations on 16 August 2004.\n In summary, the CRC is manned 24/7 to support NATO and national Quick Reaction Alert requirements. Managing the UK's network-enabled capability for the Homeland Defence task, the CRC also supports the training of Air Surveillance and Control System personnel, UK and NATO partner aircrew for deployment on operations worldwide.[11]\n The ASACS Force Resource Management Hub is based at RAF Boulmer. It currently employs 14 Civilian personnel, 12 located at RAF Boulmer and 2 at RAF Scampton.

The scheduled total trip time is 5.5 hours. Operations are subsidized by the states of Vermont and New York, and the train is popular among vacationers travelling to the ski resort area of Killington, Vermont. The Ethan Allen Express is named for the American Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen. Between Penn Station and Rensselaer, it operates along the Empire Corridor.\n In April 1995, the Montrealer was shifted to daytime operation, cut back to St. Albans, and renamed as the Vermonter, providing daytime service to eastern and central Vermont for the first time since 1966.[2] The western part of the state then advocated for rail service to Rutland as well. $4.7 million in federal funds was secured to upgrade the former Delaware and Hudson Railway Whitehall Branch between Whitehall and Rutland for passenger speeds.[3] Service was initiated on December 2, 1996.[4] This was the first passenger service to Rutland since the Rutland Railroad ended its Burlington\u2013New York City service in 1953, and the first passenger service on the Whitehall Branch since 1936.[3]\n The Ethan Allen Express began with stops in Rutland, Fort Edward, Saratoga Springs, Schenectady, Albany\u2013Rensselaer, Hudson, Rhinecliff, Poughkeepsie, Croton, Yonkers and New York City.[5] A stop at Fair Haven was added in November 1997.[6]\n Until May 2002, the train included a baggage car for skis and unboxed bicycles as well as checked baggage.[citation needed]\n In October 2008, the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) proposed eliminating the Ethan Allen Express and replacing it with a bus citing budgetary restrictions. The proposal was rejected by a legislative committee.[7] VTrans again proposed ending service in January 2009; two hundred people rallied at Rutland station against the proposed cut.[8] Rail advocates, led by the Vermont Rail Action Network[9] and local political leaders[10] organized to fight the cut and plans to drop the service were abandoned.[11]\n On January 2, 2010, the Ethan Allen Express began stopping at Castleton. Service to Fair Haven ended on January 9.[12]\n On February 23, 2011, VTrans began an investigation into the Vermont Rail System's (VRS) handling of the Ethan Allen Express between Whitehall, New York and Rutland after Amtrak notified the state that track conditions meant the train was frequently delayed. Amtrak evaluated the line as the worst in the nation.[13] During the summer of 2011, VRS conducted work to improve the track in question, planned to result in an eighteen-minute reduction in travel time by the end of the year, with additional work planned for the summer of 2012.[14] The project was funded by both the railroad and the state of New York at a cost of $3.25 million, and involved rebuilding about 8 miles (13\u00a0km) of track and eight grade crossings.[14]  By February 2012, the trackwork had resulted in a 15-minute southbound and 25-minute northbound reduction in travel time between Rutland and Whitehall, while the total time the Ethan Allen Express operated behind schedule fell to 135 minutes in December 2011, from 11,068 minutes a year earlier.[15]\n All trains using the Empire Connection, excluding the Lake Shore Limited operated into Grand Central Terminal from May 26, to September 4, 2018 to allow work on the Empire Tunnel, the Spuyten Duyvil movable bridge, and Track 19 in New York's Penn Station.[16]\n There have been plans to extend the Ethan Allen from Rutland to Burlington since at least 2000.[17] The last passenger service between the cities was in 1953 on the Rutland Railroad's Green Mountain Flyer and Mount Royal.[2]\n In 2005, a $30 million earmark was obtained by Senator Jim Jeffords to, in part, fund the extension. Of this, $19 million remained by 2011, the balance having been used for other projects such as a new spur for freight traffic.[17][18]\n Advocates, led by chambers of commerce and the Vermont Rail Action Network, renewed the push for an extension to Burlington.[19] They believed that service to Burlington would secure the long-term sustainability of the service by generating much more ridership than Rutland is capable of.[20]\n The Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds to rebuild the tracks between Rutland and Burlington to passenger standards (59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h)).[21]  While the initial application was not approved, the state subsequently entered a second US$70 million application for similar grants,[22] and later a third, all of which were rejected.[18]\n In 2013, the extension received additional funding via a $9 million grant from the fifth round of the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER V) program to pay for the replacement of jointed rail with continuously welded rail.[23] In October 2015, the Vermont Agency of Transportation was awarded a $10 million TIGER 2015 grant to rehabilitate 11 miles of track, add a wye in Rutland, add crossovers and passing sidings, and install passenger platforms in Middlebury, Vergennes, and Burlington. These improvements will result in increased speeds of up to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) for freight and 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) for passenger trains between Rutland and Burlington.[24]\n In October 2015, VTrans said that service to Burlington would begin in three to four years.[25] However, service is currently not expected to start until 2021 or 2022. When it starts, it is anticipated that the train will arrive in Burlington in the evening and depart in the morning. Middlebury has hired a consultant to study locations for its station, while Burlington has hired a consultant to study where the train should overnight.[26][27]\n The Ethan Allen Express operates over trackage owned by the following railroads:\n The Ethan Allen Express meets the performance speeds of higher-speed rail. Between Albany and Schenectady, New York, CSX Transportation's Hudson Subdivision allows for speeds of up to 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).\n In the 2010s a typical Ethan Allen Express had three-four Amfleet passenger cars, an Amfleet business class car, and an Amfleet cafe car, with the train being pulled by a GE P32AC-DM dual-mode locomotive.[28]\n \n", " Carrick Furnace is a historic iron furnace located at Metal Township in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.

It is situated in Broad Street, now the principal shopping street of the English town of Reading. The building has been sympathetically reused as a branch of the Waterstone's chain of bookshops. The building is a Grade II listed building.[1]\n The main building was built in 1707 and is set back from Broad Street. The interior is roughly square with encircling galleries, and a domed ceiling with modillion cornice. Later additions were made to the side and rear of the original building. In 1892 a separate frontage building was built along the building line of Broad Street, with an arch surmounted by a tower, itself capped by octagonal turret, and flanked by two shops.[1][2]\n Waterstone's now occupies both the chapel building and most of the frontage building (one shop unit being independently occupied). The frontage building has been linked to the main chapel by a lightweight modern glass-roofed conservatory.

After emerging in the wave of Argentine New Rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Babasonicos became one of the banner groups of the \"sonic\" underground rock movement in Argentina in the late 1990s.\n The band name refers partly to Sai Baba, the Indian guru, and partly to The Jetsons, whose Spanish version is called Los Supers\u00f3nicos.\n The lead singer Adri\u00e1n \"D\u00e1rgelos\" Rodr\u00edguez and the keyboardist Diego \"Uma-T\" Tu\u00f1\u00f3n initially decided to create a new wave style, which wouldn't follow the established Argentine music.

This same year the band saw the departure of their longtime manager Cosme.\n In 1999, they collaborated with Ian Brown on a song that bears their name on his album Golden Greats.\n Although the band has never been afraid to experiment with various diverse styles throughout their career, since they recorded Jessico (2001) their songs have become simpler and more in tune with current trends in music. Some believe this to be a contradiction with their original tenets, and that Babasonicos has turned into a mainstream marketable band.\n Their following records, Infame (2003), Anoche (2005), Mucho (2008), and \"A Prop\u00f3sito\" (2011) are proof that they have reached a broader audience.\n Babasonicos also composed the soundtrack for Vera Fogwill's movie Las Mantenidas Sin Sue\u00f1os (Kept and Dreamless), which was released in 2007.

It was completed in 2014 and is the 144th temple of the LDS Church. The announcement of the planned construction of the temple on May 24, 2008, came a month after the Gila Valley and Gilbert temples were announced for Arizona.[3][4]\n The announcement to build a temple in Phoenix came in part as a response to the high concentration of church members in the area and to help ease the load on the nearby Mesa Arizona Temple.[3][5]\n The original design of the temple, which resembled the Draper Utah Temple in design, exceeded the maximum height restrictions imposed by existing zoning law and required an exception be granted by the Phoenix city council. The primary issue was not the planned steeple height of 126 feet (38\u00a0m), as church steeples are exempt from zoning laws, but the temple's structural height of 40 feet (12\u00a0m).[6] The exterior color of the temple was also changed from the traditional white to a more natural stone color in an effort to address the concerns of residents in the neighborhood.[7]\n The city council voted to approve the requested zoning exemptions on December 2, 2009.[8] Local residents opposed to the construction mounted a successful campaign to call for a voter referendum on the council's decision, delivering the requisite signatures by December 31, potentially delaying the approval process until September 2011 when the issue could be put to a vote.[9] After a series of talks with the opposition, LDS Church representatives announced on January 26, 2010, that the temple would be redesigned to comply with the zoning restrictions by limiting the structural height to 30 feet (9.1\u00a0m), obviating the need for any exceptions and eliminating the need for any further approval process.[10] LDS Church representatives indicated that the redesign process would take between eight months and a year. The height of the steeple, building color and lighting are not regulated by zoning laws and it was unclear at that time if the steeple height would be changed with the redesign, or previous design concessions would be retained in the new design.[11]\n On August 17, 2010, the redesign was submitted to the city of Phoenix for preliminary approval.[12] A meeting for neighbors of the temple was held that same day.[13] The redesigned structure is 30 feet high with a 90-foot spire. This met the 30-feet zoning limit on building heights, and the total height is 9 feet lower[14] than the previously proposed design.[12]\n Ronald A.

Monson.[2]\n", " The muscles of respiration are those muscles that contribute to inhalation and exhalation, by aiding in the expansion and contraction of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm and, to a lesser extent, the intercostal muscles drive respiration during quiet breathing. Additional 'accessory muscles of respiration' are typically only used under conditions of high metabolic demand (e.g. exercise) or respiratory dysfunction (e.g. an asthma attack). However, in instances where these accessory muscles become stiff and hard, expansion of the rib cage can be restricted. Maintenance of the elasticity of these muscles is crucial to the health of the respiratory system and to maximize its functional capabilities.\n The diaphragm is the major muscle responsible for breathing. It is a thin, dome-shaped muscle that separates the abdominal cavity from the thoracic cavity. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts, so that its center moves caudally (downward) and its edges move rostrally (upward). This compresses the abdominal cavity, raises the ribs upward and outward and thus expands the thoracic cavity. This expansion draws air into the lungs.  When the diaphragm relaxes, elastic recoil of the thoracic wall causes the thoracic cavity to contract, forcing air out of the lungs.[1]\n The diaphragm is also involved in non-respiratory functions, helping to expel vomit, feces, and urine from the body by increasing intra-abdominal pressure, and preventing acid reflux by exerting pressure on the esophagus as it passes through the esophageal hiatus.\n Along with the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are one of the most important groups of respiratory muscles. These muscles are attached between the ribs and are important in manipulating the width of the rib cage. There are three layers of intercostal muscles. The external intercostal muscles are most important in respiration. These have fibres that are angled obliquely downward and forward from rib to rib.[2] The contraction of these fibres raises each rib toward the rib above, with the overall effect of raising the rib cage, assisting in inhalation.\n \"Accessory muscles\" refers to muscles that assist, but do not play a primary role, in breathing. There is some controversy concerning which muscles may be considered accessory muscles of inhalation. However, the sternocleidomastoid and the scalene muscles (anterior, middle and posterior scalene) are typically considered accessory muscles of breathing. Both assist in elevating the rib cage.[3] The involvement of these muscles seems to depend on the degree of respiratory effort. During quiet breathing, the scalenes are consistently physically active, while the sternocleidomastoids are quiet.[4] With an increase in the respiratory volume, sternocleidomastoids also become active.[5] Both muscles are simultaneously activated when one breathes in at the maximal flow rate.[4]\n Apart from the above neck muscles, the following muscles have also been observed contributing to respiration: serratus anterior, pectoralis major and pectoralis minor, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, iliocostalis lumborum, quadratus lumborum, serratus posterior superior, serratus posterior inferior, levatores costarum, transversus thoracis, subclavius (Kendall et al., 2005). The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle lifts the sides of the nostrils.\nUse of the accessory muscles while at rest is often interpreted as a sign of respiratory distress.[6]\n During quiet breathing, there is little or no muscle contraction involved in exhalation; this process is simply driven by the elastic recoil of the thoracic wall. When forceful exhalation is required, or when the elasticity of the lungs is reduced (as in emphysema), active exhalation can be achieved by contraction of the abdominal wall muscles (rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, external oblique muscle and internal oblique muscle). These press the abdominal organs cranially (upward) into the diaphragm, reducing the volume of the thoracic cavity.[1]\n The internal intercostal muscles have fibres that are angled obliquely downward and backward from rib to rib.[2] These muscles can therefore assist in lowering the rib cage, adding force to exhalation.[1]\n", " The 2018\u201319 California Golden Bears women's basketball team represented University of California, Berkeley during the 2018\u201319 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

He is best known as the producer of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (Jazz Fest) founded by George Wein. Davis has been involved in the production of the event from its start in 1970. He is the CEO of Festival Productions, Inc. - New Orleans, the company that produces the Jazz Fest.\n Davis was born Arthur Quentin Davis, Jr. in New Orleans.[1] He was the first of three children of the family. His father was an architect whose firm designed notable buildings such as Louisiana Superdome and the New Orleans Arena.[2]\n Davis majored in drama and ethnomusicology at Tulane University.[2] While still in college, Davis met Wein who was looking for local co-workers to produce the Jazz Fest.[2] He dropped out of college to be involved in the Festival production with Wein. \n The first Festival took place at the Congo Square in Louis Armstrong Park. Davis also became a manager of Professor Longhair[2] and road manager for Duke Ellington, McCoy Tyner and B.B. King.[1][3]\n In 1989, Professor Longhair's album Houseparty New Orleans Style which was produced by Davis won the Best Traditional Blues Recording category of the Grammy Awards.[1][4]\n In 1993, Davis produced America\u2019s Reunion on the Mall, a festival organized as a part of President Bill Clinton's inaugural events.[5]\n Today, Davis still plays the leading role in producing the Jazz Fest. He also acts as the spokesperson of the event and emcees at the Festival.[2][6] Davis has said of his philosophy behind selecting the Jazz Fest lineup, \"Our bottom line is...musicianship. Whatever you do, you have to be great.\"[7]\n Apart from the Jazz Fest, Davis is also engaged in the production of Essence Music Festival, another big music event in New Orleans.[5]\n", " \n Tolpia mons is a moth of the Micronoctuidae family.

She was a member of the Pritzker family, one of the wealthiest families in Chicago, through her marriage to lawyer and businessman, Jack Pritzker.[1] The Pritzker family founded the Hyatt hotel chain during the 1950s.[2]\n Rhoda Pritzker was born Rhoda Goldberg in 1914 to Jewish parents in Manchester, England.[1] Her parents were Morris Goldberg, a Gilbert and Sullivan circus performer, and Cissie Goldberg, a concert pianist.[1] She did not begin her schooling until she was ten years old due to a case of tuberculosis.[1] She dropped out before completing high school in order to take a position with a newspaper in Southport, Lancashire.[1] She also worked for a number of other British newspapers and the British Broadcasting Corporation at a young age.[2]\n Goldberg immigrated to the United States in 1939 on one of the last trans-Atlantic passenger ship convoys before the full outbreak of World War II. Pritzker family lore claims that she wore her life preserver throughout the entire length of the voyage due to the constant threat of German U-boat attack.[1] She initially took a job as a blackjack dealer in Reno, Nevada, as part of an assignment for a magazine[1] before landing a position in New York City as a foreign correspondent for The Associated Press of Great Britain during World War II.[2]\n Goldberg met her future husband, Jack Nicholas Pritzker, on a blind date in Manhattan.[1] The couple were married in 1943, shortly after Jack entered the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant, junior grade during World War II.[1] Rhoda and Jack resided in Princeton, New Jersey, and Key West, Florida, during the war. Rhoda volunteered for the Red Cross while living in Key West, beginning her career in philanthropy.[1] She moved to Chicago with her husband following the end of World War II. Jack Pritzker resumed his career as a lawyer at his law firm, Pritzker and Pritzker.[2] She continued to work as a freelance journalist after her arrival in Chicago. However, she also became deeply interested in philanthropy. The couple bought a winter home in Casey Key, Florida, in 1970.[2]\n Rhoda and Jack Pritzker had one son, Nicholas J. Pritzker.[2] She was widowed in 1979.[1]\n She was known to be a passionate contemporary British art collector. She was a leading supporter of works by such artists as Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore and L.S. Lowry.[1]\n Rhoda Pritzker supported a wide array of causes and organizations as a philanthropist throughout her life. Many of the causes which she championed involved animals, education and the arts.[1][2]\n Pritzker served on the board of directors of the Goodman School of Drama (now called the Theater School at DePaul University) for many years.[1] She was a founding board member of the New College of Florida and continued to serve on the school's board for more than 20 years.[2] Pritzker was a major donor to the New College of Florida's $2.5\u00a0million Marine Biology Research Center, which opened in the late 1990s.[2] In the mid-2000s, an endowment fund and college dormitory were named for Rhoda Pritzker after the Pritzker family's philanthropic foundation gave the college $2\u00a0million in her Rhoda's name.[2]\n Additionally, Pritzker served on the board of trustees of the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, during the 1980s.[2]\n Pritzker helped to establish the Chicago area Animal Protective Association, an animal shelter and adoption service.[2] She also actively supported a number of animal shleters and rescue centers in Florida. She was reported to be close friends with Cleveland Amory, a well-known animal rights activist.[2] Pritzker was personally known to take in and adopt stray animals. She never collected or wore fur coats.[1]\n Rhoda Pritzker died at her winter home in Casey Key, Florida, on December 23, 2007, at the age of 93.[2] She had reportedly been in declining health for several months. Her funeral was held in Chicago.[2]\n", " Originally known as Optimal Subband Tree Structuring (SB-TS) also called Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD)\n(sometimes known as just Wavelet Packets or Subband Tree) is a wavelet transform where the discrete-time (sampled) signal is passed through more filters than the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).\n In the DWT, each level is calculated by passing only the previous wavelet approximation coefficients (cAj) through discrete-time low and high pass quadrature mirror filters.[1]  However, in the WPD, both the detail (cDj (in the 1-D case), cHj, cVj, cDj (in the 2-D case)) and approximation coefficients are decomposed to create the full binary tree.[2]\n[3][4][5][6][7]\n For n levels of decomposition the WPD produces 2n different sets of coefficients (or nodes) as opposed to (3n + 1) sets for the DWT.  However, due to the downsampling process the overall number of coefficients is still the same and there is no redundancy.\n From the point of view of compression, the standard wavelet transform may not produce the best result, since it is limited to wavelet bases that increase by a power of two towards the low frequencies. It could be that another combination of bases produce a more desirable representation for a particular signal. The best basis algorithm by Coifman and Wickerhauser[1] finds a set of bases that provide the most desirable representation of the data relative to a particular cost function (e.g. entropy).\n There were relevant studies in signal processing and communications fields to address the selection of subband trees (orthogonal basis) of various kinds, e.g. regular, dyadic, irregular, with respect to performance metrics of interest including energy compaction (entropy), subband correlations and others.\n[3]\n[4][5]\n[6]\n[7]\n Discrete wavelet transform theory (continuous in the variable(s)) offers an approximation to transform discrete (sampled) signals. In contrast, the discrete subband transform theory provides a perfect representation of discrete signals.[5]\n Wavelet packets were successfully applied in preclinical diagnosis.[8]\n", " The George W. Mallett House is a historic house in Princeton, Arkansas, the first county seat of Dallas County.  Built c. 1853 by George W. Mallett, one of the county's first settlers, it is one of three surviving pre-Civil War houses in the county, and the only one in Princeton.  The house was originally built as a dog trot; the breezeway was enclosed around the turn of the 20th century, giving the house its present exterior appearance of a central hall structure.  A hip roof covers the original portion of the house, while a gable covers a two-room ell added to the rear (also dating to the turn of the century).  A shed-roof porch extends across the width of the main facade, supported by chamfered posts.[2]\n The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]\n \n", " \n Pornography in the United States has existed since the country's origins and has become more readily accessible in the 21st century. Advanced by technological development, it has gone from a hard-to-find \"back alley\" item, beginning in 1969 with Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, the Golden Age of Porn (1969\u20131984) and home video, to being more available in the country and later, starting in the 1990s, readily accessible to nearly anyone with a computer or other device connected to the Internet. The U.S. has no current plans to block explicit content from minors, as many other countries have planned or processed to do.\n Attempts made to suppress it include: outright bans, prohibitions of its sale, censorship or rating schemes that restrict audience numbers, and claims that it is prostitution and thereby subject to regulations governing prostitution. Legal decisions affecting production and consumption of pornography include those relating to its definition, its relationship with prostitution, the definition of obscenity, rulings about personal possession of pornography, and its standing in relation to freedom of expression rights.\n American advocates for pornography often cite the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech; however, under the Miller test established by Miller v. California, anything lacking \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\" is generally not protected. However, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) that pornography which involves consenting adults is protected by the First Amendment, even if the models \"appear to be\" minors but are, in fact of lawful age, and thus has seen to protect the majority of, but not all pornography on the basis of first-amendment law.[1] Pornography's critics and detractors have blamed it for a succession of societal and spiritual ills.\n Although pornography dates back thousands of years, its existence in the U.S. can be traced to its 18th-century origins and the influx of foreign trade and immigrants. By the end of the 18th century, France had become the leading country regarding the spread of porn pictures.[2] Porn had become the subject of playing-cards, posters, post cards, and cabinet cards. Prior to this printers were previously limited to engravings, woodcuts, and line cuts for illustrations.[3] As trade increased and more people immigrated from countries with less Puritanical and more relaxed attitudes toward human sexuality, the amount of available visual pornography increased.\n In 1880, halftone printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time.[4] The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white.\n The first porn daguerreotype appeared in 1855 and with the advent of \"moving pictures\" by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers the first porn film was made soon after the public exhibition of their creation. Pornographic film production commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture in 1895. Two of the earliest pioneers were Eug\u00e8ne Pirou and Albert Kirchner. Kirchner directed the earliest surviving pornographic film for Pirou under the trade name \"L\u00e9ar\". The 1896 film, Le Coucher de la Marie showed Louise Willy performing a striptease. Pirou's film inspired a genre of risqu\u00e9 French films showing women disrobing and other filmmakers realized profits could be made from such films.[5][6] In the United States, one of the Thomas Edison's first efforts using his methods and equipment for making moving pictures was of a nude woman getting up from her bath tub and running away.[7]\n In the 20th century, the era of \"blue movies\" began with the silent films of the 1920s and continued throughout the post-war era as film technology improved and equipment costs were reduced to a consumer affordable level. Particularly with the introduction of the 8mm and super-8 film gauges, popular for the home movie market. Until the advent of electronic and digital video technology, the mass production of pornographic films was tied directly to the mainstream film industry.[8] Beginning in 1969 with Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, the subsequent Golden Age of Porn and more permissive legislation, a rise of adult theaters in the United States, and many other countries, developed. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated \"movie booths\" in sex shops that displayed pornographic \"loops\" (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).[8]\n By 1982, pornographic film production had switched to the cheaper and more convenient medium of video tape. Many film directors were hesitant to switch because of the different image quality that video tape produced. Those who did make the change benefited from greater profits since consumers preferred the new format. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the beginning of the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since video production was inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands of videos were including compilations of just the sex scenes from various titles.[9][10]\n In the late 1990s, pornographic films were distributed on DVD. These offered better quality picture and sound than the previous video format and allowed innovations such as \"interactive\" videos that let users choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.\n The introduction and widespread availability of the Internet further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously videos would be rented or purchased through mail-order, but with the Internet people could watch pornographic movies on their computers, and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).\n As of the 2000s, there were hundreds of adult film companies, releasing tens of thousands of productions, recorded directly on video, with minimal sets. Of late, web-cams and web-cam recordings are again expanding the market. Thousands of pornographic actors work in front of the camera to satisfy pornography consumers' demand while often making money per view.\n By the 2010s, the fortunes of the pornography industry had changed. With reliably profitable DVD sales being largely supplanted by streaming media delivery over the Internet, competition from pirate, amateur, and low-cost professional content on the Internet had made the industry substantially less profitable, leading to it shrinking in size.[11][12]\n American adult magazines which have the widest distribution do not violate the Miller test and can be legally distributed. Adult magazines have been largely put into mainstream by the pioneer Playboy. However, during the so-called Pubic Wars in the 1960s and 1970s Penthouse established itself as a more explicit magazine. Screw magazine moved the bar toward hardcore when it first came out in 1968 and with Hustler appearing in 1974 the move to hardcore was complete. By the mid-'90s magazines like Playboy had become noncompetitive and even hardcore publications like Penthouse and Hustler struggled. According to Laura Kipnis, a cultural theorist and critic, \"the Hustler body is an unromanticized body\u2014no vaselined lens or soft focus: this is neither the airbrushed top-heavy fantasy body of Playboy, nor the ersatz opulence, the lingeried and sensitive crotch shots of Penthouse, transforming female genitals into objets d'art. It's a body, not a surface or a suntan: insistently material, defiantly vulgar, corporeal\".[13]\n Many adult magazines in the United States are now highlighted by special features and are usually sold wrapped to avoid their look-see by the under-age persons. A primarily softcore Barely Legal focuses on models between 18 and 23 years. Hustler's Leg World is focused on the female legs and feet. Perfect 10 publishes the images of women, untouched by plastic surgery or airbrushing.\n Pornographic bookstores have been subject to U.S. zoning laws.[14]\n Much of the pornography produced in the United States is in the form of movies and the branch acutely competes with the Internet. The market is very diverse and ranges from the mainstream heterosexual content to the rarefied S/M, BDSM, interracial sex, ethnic, etc. through enduringly popular gay porn.\n Early American stag films included Wonders of the Unseen World (1927), An Author's True Story (1933), Goodyear (1950s), Smart Alec (1951), and Playmates (1956\u201358). Breakthrough films, such as 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, 1972's Deep Throat, 1973's The Devil in Miss Jones and 1976's The Opening of Misty Beethoven by Radley Metzger, launched the so-called \"porno chic\" phenomenon in the United States and enabled the commercialization of the adult film industry.  In this period America's most notorious pornographer was Reuben Sturman. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, throughout the 1970s, Sturman controlled most of the pornography circulating in the country.\n The country now houses over 40 adult movies studios featuring heterosexual scenes,[15] more than any other country. The branch, according to founder and president of Adult Video News Paul Fishbein, involves the manufacturers of adult products, distributors, suppliers, retail store owners, wholesalers, distributors, cable TV buyers, and foreign buyers. The production is concentrated in San Fernando Valley (mainly in Chatsworth, Reseda and Van Nuys) and Las Vegas, where more than 200 adult entertainment companies gather to network and show off their latest wares.[16] The world's largest adult movies studio, Vivid Entertainment, generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually[17] and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the Internet. Vivid's two largest regional competitors are Wicked Pictures and Digital Playground. Colorado-based New Frontier Media, a leading distributor of adult movies (at NASDAQ since November 2000), is one of the two adult video companies traded publicly, the other one being Spanish Private Media Group.\n The industry's decision to embrace VHS in the early 1980s, for example, helped to do away with Sony Betamax, despite the latter format's superior quality. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to half-billion by 1993.[18] Suffering at the hands of video warez tended not be publicly stressed by country's film industry.[19] In 1999 there were 711 million rentals of hardcore films.[20] 11,300 hardcore films were released in 2002.\n In the recent years, according to Fishbein, there are well over 800 million rentals of adult videotapes and DVDs in video stores across the country. Digital Playground said it is choosing the Blu-ray Disc for all of its \"interactive\" films because of its greater capacity.[21]\n The female demographic is considered to be the biggest catalyst for pornographic cultural crossover.[22] According to Adella O'Neal, a Digital Playground publicist, in 2000 roughly 9% of the company's consumers were women while four years later that figure has bloomed to 53%.\n American adult pay-per-view television is presently unregulated since it is not technically \"broadcasting\" as defined in the Federal Communications Act. Cable and satellite television networks host about six main adult-related channels. Most of them (particularly Playboy TV, Penthouse TV, and Hustler TV (there is also a \"Hustler Video\", a line of raunchy films created by Larry Flynt)) are maintained by three mainstream porn magazines. In 1999 Playboy Enterprises sold to Vivid Entertainment a small channel which was renamed to Hot Network. Since that Vivid launched two more channels\u2014the Hot Zone and Vivid TV. The viewers paid close to $400 million a year to tune into Vivid's hardcore content and the company soon overtook Playboy as operator of the world's largest adult-TV network. However, after passing the 2000 United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group case Playboy bought all three networks from Vivid in 2001 and folded them into \"Playboy's Spice\" brand. Operators then shunned \"Playboy's Spice Platinum\", a new group of channels with graphic hardcore fare.[23]\n Some subsidiaries of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like News Corporation's DirecTV. Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, once pulled in $50 million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as Playboy and Hustler were small by comparison.[24]\n Microsoft has long declined to license development software to game makers whose titles include sexual content. Wal-Mart, America's largest distributor of video games, maintains the policy of selling no games with an AO rating.[25] However, in recent years the pornographic content in video games has been promoted particularly by Playboy. Playboy: The Mansion became the first game built around the \"Playboy\" license.[26]\n A downloadable mod\u2014\"Hot Coffee\" for the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas brought attention to the need to discuss the challenges faced in creating games with pornographic content. Meanwhile, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was pulled from shelves by Rockstar Games after it became public knowledge that, with the use of a Gameshark cheating device, the scene could be unlocked portraying the protagonist having sex with another character, although in the scene both characters have their clothes on. The game was later sold without the unlockable scene.[27]\n PlayStation 2 video game God of War (2005), based on Greek mythology, features an event in the first part of the game where protagonist Kratos can have sex with two topless prostitutes, who reside in a bedroom on his boat. Although no sexual acts are depicted (they occur off-screen and are indicated by sound effects), the women are shown topless. The player interacts by performing button and joystick commands that appear on screen which results in an experience reward for the player. This type of sex mini-game became a prominent feature for the God of War series, being included in its sequels God of War II (2007), God of War: Chains of Olympus (2008), God of War III (2010), and God of War: Ghost of Sparta (2010), with the latter being the final game to feature it.[28]\n The adult sections of American comic book stores frequently carry a large number of translations of Japanese hardcore comics, as well as an increasing number of home imitations.[29]\n One of the Japanese animation porn movies, which started the American adult video market, was Urotsukidoji. The adult animation market exists primarily through direct sales: mail-order to customers, and wholesale to specialty shops which cater to animation and to comic-book fans.[30] The legal framework in both countries regarding the regulation of obscene and pornographic material is overall rather similar.[31]\n The Internet maintains a significant part of American adult entertainment, also because the 1997 Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union case specified that the term \"indecent\" has no specific legal meaning in the context of the Internet. More recent federal efforts, such as the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 expressly addressed the Internet.[32] On May 1, 2000, American Express announced it would no longer cover transactions from adult sites.[33][34] According to the Committee to Study Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content, there are over 100,000 subscription sites with adult content in the United States, with each site having multiple web pages. On average, a paid subscription generates $20 to $40 per month in revenue, however, an in-depth analysis is complicated. If a visitor site connects to a pay site and signs up for content, it receives a conversion fee from the larger site. A successful large operation is often an umbrella company serving many markets with pay sites. Around this core and its affiliates is a system of ad-supported service sites.[35] The so-called portable porn market is in its initial stage in the U.S.[36]\n In 2000 the owners and operators of Playgirl.com and scores of other adult sites were charged by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with illegally billing thousands of consumers for services that were advertised as free, and for billing other consumers who never visited the web sites at all.[37] Nevadan Voice Media Incorporated, which ran several adult sites, was also charged by the Commission. Sites often suffer from unauthorized, non-paying surfers who use stolen passwords, which can use month's worth of bandwidth in a day, costing the site operator hundreds or thousands of dollars' worth of additional bandwidth fees, all for traffic that returns no money at all.[38] The 2002 Paragon Electric Co., Inc. v. Buy This Domain case ruled that linking domain names to pornographic sites is not per se conclusive of bad-faith registration and use, although it does raise that presumption.[39]\n A common occurrence was the use of domain names similar to known ones, such as whitehouse.com (unrelated to whitehouse.gov), which for some period featured explicit content.[40] The use of expired domains is also common, along with typosquatting, which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser.[41]\n In 1975, the total retail value of all the hardcore pornography in the U.S. was estimated at $5\u201310 million.[42] The 1979 Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that \"in Los Angeles alone, the pornography business does $100 million a year in gross retail volume\" while \"the average pornography magazine sells for between $6 and $10 each\". According to the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.[43] The total income of modern country's adult entertainment is often rated at $10\u201313 billion, of which $4\u20136 billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by Forrester Research and was lowered in 1998.[44] In 2007 The Observer newspaper also gave a figure of $13 billion.[45] Other sources, quoted by Forbes (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, and IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, web sites, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys, and magazines) mention the $2.6\u20133.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component). USA Today claimed in 2003 that websites such as Danni's Hard Drive and Cybererotica.com generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time.[46] The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by AVN Publications at $4.3 billion but how this figure was determined is unclear. According to the 2001 Forbes data the annual income distribution is like this:\n The Online Journalism Review, published by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California, weighed in with an analysis that favored Forbes' number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate\u2014hotels keep statistics to themselves or do not keep them at all.[48] A CBS News investigation in November 2003 claimed that 50% of guests at the Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, Sheraton, and Holiday Inn hotel chains purchased adult movies, contributing to 70% of in-room profits. The income of cellphone porn is low, when compared with other countries. The absence of V-chip-style parental controls largely has kept American consumers from using cellphones to access explicit content. Porn star Ron Jeremy licensed his name to \"RJ Mobile\", which offers adult content in Britain and the Netherlands.[47]\n The lawful definition of pornography in the U.S. evolved through decades, from the 1960s. In this period, recognizing ambiguities, the term \"sexually explicit content\" gained use as one of the pornography's euphemisms,[49] but later it was determined that a distinction between pornographic and sexually explicit content is completely artificial.[50][e] In Miller v. California the Supreme Court used the definition of pornography made by Webster's Third New International Dictionary of 1969 (\"a depiction (as in a writing or painting) of licentiousness or lewdness: a portrayal of erotic behavior designed to cause sexual excitement\").[51] Black's Law Dictionary followed the Miller test and defined pornography as material that taken as a whole the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find appealing to the prurient interest. Heinle's Newbury House Dictionary of American English (2003) defined pornography as \"obscene writings, pictures, or films intended to arouse sexual desire\".\n The Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance defined pornography as the \"graphic sexually explicit subordination of women, whether in pictures or in words\". The ordinance was ruled unconstitutional by the Federal Appeals Court in American Booksellers v. Hudnut in Indianapolis (1985). Courts in California and New York have clearly rejected the argument that the making of pornography is prostitution.[52] (See California v. Freeman (1988) and People v. Paulino (2005).) The Oregon Supreme Court went even further in State v. Henry (1987) by abolishing the legal definition of obscenity in that state, ruling it violated freedom of speech as defined in the state constitution.\n Pornography as a legal term at the federal level, except the generic terms \"hardcore pornography\"[a] and \"child pornography\",[53][b] has not existed since the 1973 Miller v. California case.[54][55][c] The United States Supreme Court in Miller v. California[56] discussed pornography (which it referred to as \"sexually explicit material\") in terms of obscenity, which it held did not enjoy First Constitutional Amendment protection, and recognized that individual communities had different values and opinions on obscenity. The Court's definition of obscenity has come to be called the Miller test.[57][58] Since then several States have passed laws in terms of that test.[59][d] Relying on the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and under the terms \"obscene\" and \"immoral\", the U.S. Customs and Border Protection prohibits the importation of any pornographic material (19 U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01305a \"Immoral articles; importation prohibited\").[60]\n Attempts were made in the United States in the 1970s to close down the pornography industry by prosecuting those in the industry on prostitution charges. The prosecution started in the courts in California in the case of People v. Freeman. The California Supreme Court acquitted Freeman and distinguished between someone who takes part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone whose role is merely portraying a sexual relationship on-screen as part of their acting performance. The State did not appeal to the United States Supreme Court making the decision binding in California, where most pornographic films are made today.[8]\n The term \"pornography\" first appeared in an 1857 British medical dictionary, which defined it as \"a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene\",[61] therefore pornography by itself was not a widely used term in nineteenth-century America[62] and the term did not appear in any version of American Dictionary of the English Language in its early editions. The dictionary introduced the entry in 1864, defining it primarily as a \"treatment of, or a treatise on, the subject of prostitutes or prostitution\". Early charges used the term \"obscenity\" as well as after Miller v. California, though the term \"pornography\" remained as a reference entry:\n The upcoming censorship of pornographic materials in the United States became based on the First, and partially Ninth[63] and Fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. It also includes the so-called harm principle, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom.[64] The absolutist interpretation of the First Amendment as applied to pornography has never been sustained by the Supreme Court.[65] In the Investigation of Literature Allegedly Containing Objectionable Material, issued by the U.S. Congress Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1953, it was noted that \"perhaps the greatest impediments to the prompt and effective enforcement of existing laws intended to control pornographic materials are the difficulties of establishing a precise interpretation of the word\". During the Warren Court (1953\u20131969), the first notable court to face the cases of such kind, justices Potter Stewart, Byron White, and Arthur Goldberg shared the opinion that only hardcore pornography was not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.[66] This position was contested notably by U.S. Solicitor General James Lee Rankin (in office 1956\u20131961),[67] but in Jacobellis v. Ohio Stewart concluded that criminal obscenity laws are constitutionally limited under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to hardcore pornography.[68] Concurring in the 1957 Roth v. United States Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that \"even assuming that pornography cannot be deemed ever to cause, in an immediate sense, criminal sexual conduct, other interests within the proper cognizance of the States may be protected by the prohibition placed on such materials.\"\n The 1967 Public Law 90-100 found the traffic in pornography to be \"a matter of national concern\", as well as in obscenity.[69] In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 Ginzburg v. United States case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice Hugo Black in the 1966 Mishkin v. New York: \"I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read.\"[70] In the 1974 Hamling v. United States decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials are for sale and purchased around the country, \"Mere availability of similar materials by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities.\"[71] The 1976 American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defined that pornography consists of \"written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings\". Since determining what is pornography and what is \"soft core\" and \"hard core\" are subjective questions to judges, juries, and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow.[72] The Rehnquist Court further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography.[73] Current Chief Justice John Roberts told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: \"Well, Senator, it's my understanding under the Supreme Court's doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not\".[74]\n The famous Indianapolis definition of pornography by Dworkin and MacKinnon paralleled their Minneapolis ordinance. The first was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for several reasons. The ordinance did not use any of the accepted terms that the Supreme Court had developed over time for determining when material is obscene, including \"prurient interest\", \"offensiveness\", or \"local community standards\".[75] Another concern was the way the women were depicted in the work. If women were referred to in the approved fashion stressing equality, the activity involved would be regardless of how sexually explicit it was.[75] The Court also indicated that if women were referred to in a disapproving way depicting them as subversive or as enjoying humiliation, the activity would be unlawful regardless of the \"literary, artistic or political qualities of the work taken as a whole\".[75] Judge Frank Easterbrook said: \"We accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and injury at home, battery and rape on the streets.... Yet this simply demonstrates the power of pornography as speech.\"[76] Conceptions of Democracy in American Constitutional Argument: The Case of Pornography Regulation by Frank Michelman, issued by Tennessee Law Review (vol. 56, no. 291, 1989) partially consented that \"pornography is political expression in that it promulgates a certain view of women's natures and thus of women's appropriate relations and treatment in society\", but also concluded that the Indianopolis ordinance was precisely designed to suppress that particular view by censoring pornography. Minneapolis ordinance was struck down on the grounds that it was ambiguous and vague, however, despite of its failure the proposal influenced other communities across the United States.[75]\n In May 2005 U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales established an Obscenity Prosecution Task Force.[77] The task force, according to a Department of Justice news release on May 5, was \"dedicated to the investigation and prosecution of the distributors of hard-core pornography that meets the test for obscenity, as defined by the United States Supreme Court.\" Under President Bush's and Gonzales' rationales the FBI Adult Obscenity Squad[78] was recruited in August 2005 to gather evidence against \"manufacturers and purveyors\" of adult pornography.[79]\n The 1970 Lockhart Commission recommended eliminating all criminal penalties for pornography except for pornographic depictions of minors, or sale of pornography to minors.[80] However, prior to 1977, only two states had laws which prohibited the use of children in the production or distribution of pornographic materials or performances.[81] In 1977, the Department of Justice strongly endorsed legislation which banned the production and dissemination of child pornography.[82] These efforts have been unsuccessfully challenged in the 1982 New York v. Ferber case (\"The States are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children...\").[83] Although the states have a different age of consent, in accordance with the Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law all models featured in pornographic content should be at least 18 years of age. This kind of material is often labeled as \"adult\" and the appropriate disclaimers are common. They are based on what \"depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs\".[84]\n It is a federal crime to possess, distribute, or produce non-fictional child pornography and carries large fines and prison sentences of up to 30 years upon conviction and requirement to register as a sex offender.[85]\n An anti-pornography movement has existed in the United States since before the 1969 Supreme Court decision of Stanley v. Georgia, which held that people could view whatever they wished in the privacy of their own homes, by establishing an implied \"right to privacy\" in U.S. law.[86] This led President Lyndon B. Johnson, with the backing of Congress, to appoint a commission to study pornography.[87] The anti-pornography movement seeks to maintain or restore restrictions and to increase or create restrictions on the production, sale or dissemination of pornography.\n Jesuit priest Father Morton A. Hill (1917-1985) was a leader of the campaign against pornography in the United States in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He was one of the founders of Morality in Media, which was created in 1962 to fight pornography. Morality in Media was launched by an interfaith group of clergy and Hill was president until his death in 1985. Morality in Media continues with Patrick A. Trueman, a registered federal lobbyist,[88][89] as president.[90]\n So prominent was Hill on the issue, that in 1969 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Father Hill and another clergyman on the Commission, Dr. Winfrey C. Link, believed that the Commission was stacked with supporters of loosening laws on pornography, and issued the Hill-Link Minority Report rebutting the conclusions of the majority report, which held that pornography should be decriminalized as there were no links between it and criminal behavior. The majority report was widely criticized and rejected by Congress.[87] The Senate rejected the Commission's findings and recommendations by a 60\u20135 vote, with 34 abstentions.[91] President Nixon, who had succeeded Johnson in 1969, also emphatically rejected the majority report.[92] The Hill-Link Minority Report, on the other hand, which recommended maintaining anti-obscenity statutes, was read into the record of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It was cited by the Burger Court in its 1973 obscenity decisions, including Miller v. California.[93]\n a ^  In the 1969 Stanley v. Georgia case (later followed by the 1971 United States v. Reidel), the Supreme Court ruled that private possession of pornography (except child pornography as determined in 1990 by a 6 to 3 decision[80][94]) in the home was not a crime, nor was it subject to government regulation. Technically why people have a constitutional right to watch hardcore pornography privately has never been explained,[95] but in the 1973 Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton Chief Justice Burger wrote: \"We categorically disapprove the theory, apparently adopted by the trial judge, that obscene, pornographic films acquire constitutional immunity from state regulation simply because they are exhibited for consenting adults only. This holding was properly rejected by the Georgia Supreme Court.\"[96] Miller v. California held 5\u20134 that the state may outlaw the showing of hardcore pornographic films, even if the \"adult theatre\" is clearly labeled and warns.\n b. ^ Sex tourism involving persons under 18 outside the U.S. is also illegal.[97]\n c. ^  The term \"dial-a-porn\" was used at the federal level e.g. by the Telecommunications Act of 1996,[98] but it was partially voided by federal courts over subsequent years.[99] Another term usage includes the 1996 Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. Federal Communications Commission certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[100]\n d ^  The transportation of pornography in interstate commerce was banned in the 1973 case of United States v. Orito. The Supreme Court upheld zoning restrictions that either quarantine or disperse pornography merchants, leaving it to local officials to determine whether local interests are best served by restricting all porn merchants to a single district. Though the Court has also upheld zoning that prohibits pornographic entertainment within a certain distance of a school, the legitimate primary purpose excludes the preventing of access by minors which can be achieved much more directly by simple restrictions.[101] On May 13, 2002, writing for the majority in Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that using community standards to identify material that could be harmful to minors does not make the law overly broad and therefore unconstitutional under the First Amendment.[102]\n e ^ Utah uses the legal term \"pornography\" for the same illegal sexually explicit material.[103]\n f ^  See also the 1977 Splawn v. California and 1978 Pinkus v. United States.\n", " Tamchen is an ancient Maya city, located in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico. It was discovered in August 2014, along with Lagunita, by Ivan Sprajc, associate professor at the Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and his team, after they reviewed aerial photographs of the area.[1]\n", " Misthi or  Misti, was a Greek city in the region of Cappadocia, in what is now Turkey. It was situated 82 kilometres southwest of the regional capital of Caesarea (Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), nowadays Kayseri, Turkey, and belonged administratively to the nearby city of Nigde, 26 kilometres north-northwest and at an altitude of 1380 metres above sea level.\n  \u00ab\u2019\u0391\u03c0\u2019 \u039c\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af \u2019\u03bc\u03b9, \u03bd\u03ac \u03c0\u03ac\u03bc\u2019 \u03c3\u2019 \u039c\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u00bb\n (From Misthi I am, let's go to Misthi)\n There exist multiple explanations as to the origins and establishment of the city as well as to the etymology of its name. For instance, according to Koimisoglou (2005:434) some sources trace the origin of Misthi to 401 BC when Greek mercenaries came to work for the Persian king Cyrus in the battle against his brother Artaxerxes II. A group of Greek soldiers was given the order to search for food and water. Some of them found an uninhabited area and settled down. Allegedly, they built a city there that became Misthi. This version of the city\u2019s creation, although interesting, has not yet become scientifically verified. Another version is that of Anastasiades (1995:16) who argues that the city was built by Greek mercenaries that were part of Alexander the Great\u2019s army. Rizos (1856:99-100), on the other hand, claims that the inhabitants of Misthi were originally from the Greek islands of Delos, Lemnos and Naxos while Carolides argues that the inhabitants of Misthi were simply Greeks from the lower port cities that came to Misthi to work as paid labour farmers. Kimisoglou (2005) also provides an explanation as to the etymology of the city's name. The ancient Greek word for mercenary is \u039c\u03af\u03c3\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (M\u00edsthios) (sing.) and in plural \u039c\u03af\u03c3\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 (M\u00edsthii) and in Modern Greek \u039c\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (Misthof\u00f3ri) or \u039c\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03af (Misthot\u00ed). Thus the name of the city he argues was a reflection of the inhabitants' original occupation. However, this is also a non-verified explanation. As it happens, the connotation of the word \u2018Misthii\u2019, although originally meaning mercenary, transformed during Byzantine times to denote labour-work, i.e. paid labour. Thus some authors have been inclined to suggest that the name refers to the skilled church builders of the city who often travelled far and took part in the constructing of churches.\n The city was inhabited purely by Greeks practicing the orthodox religion and wrongfully described as being turcophonic (speakers of the Turkish language). At closer scrutiny however, the Greek dialect spoken, also referred to as Misthiotica, is a dialect based on ancient Greek drawing heavily on Byzantine Greek and with major influx of Turkish loan words. Misthiotica (still spoken today) is a unique dialect (language) linguistically belonging to the Greek Cappadocian group of languages. Misthiotica was a consequence of the isolation the inhabitants suffered from that of other Greek cities and villages. Misthiotica was, however, also spoken by inhabitants of the nearby villages of Tsaricli, Dila (Dilion), Tseltek and Cavaclou because these villages were founded by Misthiotes.\n In reality Misthi ceased to exist after the exodus of the Misthiotes from Misthi which occurred following the population exchange according to the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 signed by Greece and Turkey. Many of the Misthiotes would simply not believe that they would be forced to leave their homeland and continued to conduct their daily duties as traders, farmers and handicraftsmen after the news had arrived. However, when Turkish authority officials entered the village and forced them to leave they had no choice. In just two days, between Tuesday, 24 June and Wednesday, 25 June 1924, the population of Misthi comprising then of approximately 4400 people left Misthi and Cappadocia for Greece never to return again. They went by foot to the seaport of Mersina and embarked on the dangerous journey by sea to the port of Piraeus, Athens, Greece. They left Turkey as Greeks and were received in Greece as Turks. The Mistiotes were among the last identified Greeks to leave Turkey, their exodus ended permanently a period of over 2500 consecutive years of Hellenic presence in Asia Minor. The Misthiotes settled down on the below following places in Greece but as their descendants have reached the fourth, and in some cases the fifth and sixth generation, they are to be found predominantly in the larger cities of Greece such as Thessaloniki and Athens.\n List of settling places of the first generation Misthiotes in Greece:\n \u00b2 The name \"G\u00f6rdana\" applied by the Misthiotes in their local dialect on current Xerochori seems most likely to be derived from the Bulgarian female name \"Gordana\". This name is in turn derived from \"Gordiana\", the feminine form of the Latin \"Gordianus\" (cf. Gordian). If true then the Misthiotes arriving by foot in the 1920s probably adopted the name from the village's previous inhabitants which are known to have been of Slavic origin and forced to move north due to the various wars the region was faced with resulting in the territory becoming annexed by Greece.\n \u00b3 The name \"Tomai\" applied by the Misthiotes on current Mandra seems most likely to be derived from the Serbian and Bulgarian form of the name \"Thomas\". As with the original name on Xerochori, if true it may indicate the ethnicity of the village's previous inhabitants.\n The city of Misthi is today inhabited by about 4000 Turkish citizens originating from the population exchange of 1924 between Greece and Turkey. The inhabitants are mostly descendants of Turks born in Thessaloniki, Greece (Tr. Selanik) and in the Kozani region at the turn of the 20th century. Descendants of the current inhabitants of the city came to Misthi while the Misthiotes had not yet left the city. When the Greeks population left the city the name changed from Misthi to Misly. Today, the city is known as Konakl\u0131.\n By the end of the 1990s the organizing committees of the descendants from the cities of Misthi and the towns of Tsaricli, Dela (Dilion), Tseltek and Cavaclou agreed to a first Annual Panhellenic Meeting in Mandra, Larissa (Greece). These meetings have since then been arranged at different locations in Greece where Misthiotes (and those related to them) settled down. In reality, the Annual Panhellenic Meeting is a cultural festival with activities ranging from art, music and dance exhibitions, academic lectures (often concerning history), gastronomical tours as well as book exposition. This event has proven highly successful in many respects and has attracted more than 3000 participants every year. In many cases, families have found relatives they did not know exist which has resulted in the illumination of their ancestry. The Gavoustema has also meant the resurrection of the Misthiotic culture which to many, especially to the youngest generations, has been completely unknown. As a result, the Gavoustema has spurred several individuals to engage in layman investigations or professional academic research about the history, culture and language of the Misthiotes.\n The Gavoustema has been hosted by the following cities:\n The Misthiotica dialect belongs to the Cappadocian branch of Greek and is thought to be based on Byzantine Greek with archaic features preserved as well as attached with a plethora of loanwords from Turkish. Some examples of this dialect are:\n Misthiotic male names\n Misthiotic\n Transcription\n English\n Modern Greek\n Compare with Greek-Cappadocian names from the Old Testament\n GREEK\n TURKISH\n ENGLISH\n Surnames were seldom used in the sense we know of today. Misthiotes referred to one another on a first name basis (a very common procedure during the Ottoman era for all Ottoman population). To separate between persons with similar or equal names they used patronymes or toponyms, i.e. names from places of origin. For instance \"Daniil dou Yaserli\" [\u0394\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ae\u03bb d\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c1\u03bb\u03b7], Daniel the Caesarian's / Daniel Caesarian's son. Such surnames became through transformation unrecognizable to the holders. The Yaserli surname for instance was originally in Greek (and Latin) Caesarius/Kaisarios [\u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or plural \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9], denoting a person from Caesaria (Kayseri). With the influx of Turkish, the name went through a transformation process that rendered it adaptable to the Turkish equivalent Kaiserli (from Kayseri and the suffix 'li' denoting belonging). Usually an initial 'K' in Byzantine Greek was transformed in the Misthiotica dialect either as \"ch\" or \"Y\". In this case it was transformed as \"Y\". When the bearers of the name entered the port of Mersina from where they were taken by boat to Piraeus, Athens, their name were written in Turkish as \"Kaiserli\". Entering Piraeus the Greek authorities \"re-Hellenised\" their name by adding a common Greek surname suffix \"-(i)dis\" and once again transformed the surname into its current form \"Kaiserlidis\". Some members continued however to pronounce the name \"Yaserli\", and due to the civil war that broke out in Greece following WWII with the loss of the village archives, they were recorded as \"Gaserli\" or \"Gaserlidis\" [\u0393\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c1\u03bb\u03b7, \u0393\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03c1\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2] during their entrance to Greek army service.\n", " Safari Helicopter is an American kit aircraft manufacturer located in Marianna, Florida.\n The company was originally known as Canadian Home Rotors and then Safari Helicopter and was founded in Ear Falls, Ontario, Canada.

Completed in 1823, the canal connected Shefford with the North Sea allowing barges of coal to be brought to the town. The canal fell into decline over the following decades and in 1876 a dam was installed on the Ivel at Sandy, closing the Shefford section for good.[4] Today, sections of the canal near Shefford are dry or have been filled in.[5]\n Coordinates: 52\u00b002\u203219\u2033N 0\u00b020\u203250\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff52.03855\u00b0N 0.34727\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.03855; -0.34727\n \n", " \n Ian Freeman is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer for the Western Suburbs Magpies. He played 65 first grade games in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership with the Magpies, and then spent a season playing with Barrow in England. He was described as a \"hard man\" known for his \"rugged play\".[2] He was also known for being bald and bearded.[3]\n A Cooma junior, Freeman made his first-grade debut with the Western Suburbs Magpies in the first game of the 1983 season. He was a regular in the side that year, playing at either prop or second row. The next year he made just 4 appearances, all losses.\n With the threat of Wests being kicked out of the competition, Freeman spent the 1985 season playing with Cooma in the country Group 16 league.[4] Returning to Wests, he was often the starting prop in 1986, and again in 1987 when he made 22 appearances for the season. In 1986 he captained the Magpies when they had a surprise 30-20 victory over Manly[5]\n Freeman missed the first 4 games of the 1988 season due to a suspension imposed after a head-high tackle in a pre-season National-Panasonic Cup match. Freeman denied the charge, saying, \"He went down fairly easily and when I slung him to the ground his head hit hard. I thought my tackle was hard but it was fair.\" On-ground officials disagreed, saying the opposing player had been unconscious before he hit the ground. Freeman received a reduced sentence because of his previously clean record.[6]\n Freeman spent two more years with Wests, before playing for Barrow in the 1989/90 English season.\n After retiring, Freeman spent a season coaching Junee.[7]\n Freeman was honoured as a bench player in the Western Suburbs Magpies' Team of the Eighties.[8]\n", "  Pennsylvania Route 965 (PA 965) is an 11.6-mile-long (18.7\u00a0km) state highway located in Mercer County and Venango County, Pennsylvania.

Her term was primarily focused on improving healthcare. In the 2004 provincial elections\u00a0[es], Llori was elected prefect of Orellana Province, representing the alliance of Pachakutik, Christian Democratic Union, and Social Christian Party.[1]\n On 8 December 2007, she was arrested on charges of sabotage and terrorism for allegedly organizing a strike in Dayuma, Ecuador.[2] During her detention, she reported experiencing humiliation and mistreatment, compelling the Human Rights Foundation to send a complaint to the Ecuadorian government.[3] On 25 January 2008, a judge of the Superior Court of Nueva Loja ordered her release, but the order was annulled just days later after the judge was accused of perverting the course of justice after stating his opinion on the matter to a local TV station.[4]\n In early March 2008, the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly granted amnesty to everyone involved in the Dayuma strike, but Llori renamed incarcerated. There were allegations against her of embezzlement of public funds intended for the construction of roads in Orellana Province.

The list also includes fatal accidents in the International Championship for Manufacturers (IMC), the predecessor to the World Rally Championship, which was contested from 1970 to 1972. Well-known fatalities involving officials, spectators and team members are also mentioned.\n The fatal accidents of the Group B era resulted in its demise. Only hours after Henri Toivonen's crash at the 1986 Tour de Corse, FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre announced that Group B cars were banned for the 1987 season. However, driver fatalities peaked in 1989, when five competitors died in the first three rallies of the season (two during reconnaissance, two who were spectating having only done reconnaissance for the event, and only one as an active competitor). Markko M\u00e4rtin's co-driver Michael Park's death at the 2005 Wales Rally GB was the WRC's first fatality in over eleven years.\n At the 1975 Safari Rally, a service car with four mechanics crashed into a truck near Mombasa. Carlino Dacista, Brian Fernandez and Willie Uis died instantly. The driver David Joshi sustained serious injuries.[1] At the 1978 Monte Carlo Rally, two mechanics, Bernard Balmer and Georges Reinier, died when their van collided with a truck near Gap, Hautes-Alpes.[2] On the second day of the 1987 Rallye C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Toyota Team Europe's Cessna 340 crashed and exploded, killing all four inside; manager and former co-driver Henry Liddon, his assistant Nigel Harris, the pilot and the navigator. Team manager Ove Andersson withdrew Toyota from the event. Prior to the accident, Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd and Fred Gallagher had been running second in their Toyota Supra Turbo.[3] At the 1996 Safari Rally, competed in bad weather and rain, three British mechanics drowned while attempting to cross a river with their Land Rover.[4]\n At the end of the fourth stage of the 1981 1000 Lakes Rally, Audi Sport driver Franz Wittmann and his co-driver Kurt Nestinger did not notice the flying finish which marks the end of the stage. They continued at race speed with their Quattro and crashed into a group of people standing in front of a van. Raul Falin, chairman of AKK, Finland's sporting authority for motorsport and the country's representative in the FIA, was quickly taken to a hospital but died from his injuries soon after. Boris Rung, co-founder and chairman of the European Rallycross Association and member of FIA's Off-Road Commission, survived the accident along with Greek FIA observer Costas Glossotis.[5]\n At the 1978 Safari Rally, five passers-by and four spectators were killed in unrelated accidents, both involving non-competitive drivers crashing into competitors.[6]\n On the first stage of the 1986 Rally Portugal, Joaquim Santos lost control of his Ford RS200 while trying to avoid spectators on the road, crashing into a crowd of spectators, killing three and injuring over thirty.[7] All the factory teams \u2013 Audi, Austin Rover, Ford, Lancia, Peugeot and Volkswagen \u2013 withdrew from the event.[8]\n At the 1996 1000 Lakes Rally, at a special stage that took place in the centre of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, one spectator died and 36 were injured when Danish driver Karsten Richardt lost control of his Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.

It debuted on Chicago's WGN in 1930, then moved to the NBC radio network Blue Network on April 6, 1931. It aired until April 26, 1942.[2][3]\n Together with Skippy (1932\u20131935) it is seen as the oldest US children's radio program.[1][4][5] Radio historian Jim Harmon attributes the show's popularity in The Great Radio Heroes to the fact that it was the only radio show to deal with and appeal to young children.[6]\n \"Little Orphan Annie\" was based on Harold Gray's eponymous and equally popular comic strip series Little Orphan Annie. The show debuted on WGN/Chicago in 1930, but only became a national hit when it moved to NBC radio's Blue Network in 1931. It was broadcast in the late afternoon and ran for twelve successful years.\n In 1931, when the show debuted, radio had yet to establish coast-to-coast networks so two separate casts performed\u2014one in San Francisco starring Floy Margaret Hughes and the other in Chicago starring Shirley Bell as Annie, Stanley Andrews as \"Daddy\", and Allan Baruck (and later Mel Torm\u00e9) as Joe Corntassel. When coast to coast networking was established in 1933, the Chicago cast became the permanent one.[6][7]\n The show was initially sponsored by Ovaltine, a flavored milk supplement, and its scripts were written by Ovaltine's Chicago ad agency staff. They shunned the overt political themes of Gray's newspaper strips and concentrated instead on pitching Ovaltine, using almost seven minutes of each broadcast to do so. Fans could redeem Ovaltine proofs of purchase for a secret decoder badge that decoded brief messages airing in the last moments of the show. Contrary to Jean Shepherd's assertions, the messages were never advertisements for Ovaltine, but were usually related to the following episode. In 1940, Quaker Puffed Wheat Sparkies became the show's sponsor and brought fictional aviator Captain Sparks to the show. Sparks eventually became the star, relegating Annie to secondary player.[6][7]\n The product placement and exploitation of premiums to retain and attract new listeners was notable.[4] Among those items were secret decoders, shake-up mugs for drinking Ovaltine (the show's sponsor product) and secret decoder rings for the Little Orphan Annie secret society.[8] The 1934 fan club's member's handbook included a simple substitution cipher with a resulting numeric cipher text. This was followed the next year with a membership badge or pin that included a cipher disk - enciphering the letters A-Z to numbers 1-26. Announcer Pierre Andre often talked about the virtues of the shows' products, sometimes stretching towards three minutes in length.[2]\n The theme song was sung by announcer Pierre Andre, as \"Uncle Andy\". Leonard Salvo was the show's organist.[10]\n Who's that little chatter box?\n The one with pretty auburn locks?\n Whom do you see?\n It's Little Orphan Annie.\n She and Sandy make a pair,\n They never seem to have a care!\n Cute little she,\n It's Little Orphan Annie.\n Bright eyes cheeks a healthy glow,\n There's a store of healthiness handy.\n Mite-size, always on the go,\n If you want to know - \"Arf\", goes Sandy.\n Always wears a sunny smile,\n Now, wouldn't it be worth a while,\n If you could be,\n Like Little Orphan Annie?\n Jean Shepherd used the show as the basis for his short story \"The Counterfeit Secret Circle Member Gets the Message, or The Asp Strikes Again.\" In the story, first-person narrator Ralphie Parker is an avid listener of the program and eagerly awaits the arrival of his decoder ring to find out the secret messages in each episode. When the ring arrives, he anxiously decodes the secret message in that day's episode, only to be disappointed when the resulting secret message was an Ovaltine commercial.\n The short story was included in Shepherd's compilation book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, and the story was also included as one of the scenes in Shepherd's 1983 film A Christmas Story.[1]\n As with most daily radio serials, very few recordings of the series' thousands of episodes survive. The Internet Archive has 38 15-minute recordings in its Old-Time Radio collection.\n In 1990 the show was inducted in the National Radio Hall of Fame.[3]\n In 1995, Shirley Bell Cole was heard in a reenactment of Little Orphan Annie on Chuck Schaden's Those Were the Days radio show.\n", " \nPeer-to-Patent Australia is an initiative designed to improve the patent examination process and the quality of issued patents by connecting the review of pending patents to an open network of experts online.\n Peer-to-Patent Australia is focused on helping patent offices perform high-quality examinations of pending patent applications by enlisting the public to help find and explain prior art. The objective of Peer-to-Patent Australia is to improve the patent examination process and the quality of issued patents by inviting members of the public to identify and nominate prior art relevant to the assessment of novelty and inventiveness of participating patent applications.[citation needed] This initiative allows the patent office to harness the expertise of qualified people within the community when assessing patent applications by inviting members of the public to identify and nominate prior art relevant to the assessment of novelty and inventiveness of participating patent applications. In doing so, it connects with the broader initiative to use Web 2.0 technologies to enhance and invigorate government administration through citizen engagement.\n To justify the award of a patent in Australia, the invention claimed must be novel and involve an inventive step when compared with the prior art base. The prior art base is the state of the art, or the technology in existence, immediately before the priority date, which is usually the date that the patent application is filed. In other words, to justify the grant of a patent, an invention must not have been seen before and must be inventive in the eyes of someone skilled in the relevant art when compared with the existing technology.\n Prior art can include earlier patents, academic papers, magazine articles, web pages, and even physical examples. Patent examiners compare a claimed invention with the prior art to determine if a given invention is both novel and not obvious to a person of ordinary skill and creativity of the invention.\n Currently in Australia, patent examiners have the sole responsibility for searching for prior art. They have a time budget of a few hours. Peer-to-Patent attempts to improve the patent process by markedly expanding the prior art search. The reasoning behind the proposal is that if prior art exists for an invention, particularly non-patent prior art, someone in the world knows about it. This knowledgeable person may be competitors in the same field, students or professors, or owners of an earlier embodiment of the invention. Peer-to-Patent Australia encourages such people to submit examples of prior art and creates communities of people worldwide who are interested in discovering prior art.\n Peer-to-Patent uses social software features to facilitate discussion amongst groups of volunteer experts. Users can upload prior art references, participate in discussion forums, rate other user submissions, add research references, invite others, and more. This helps the examiners focus their attention on the submission(s) of prior art that have the highest relevance to an application.\n If successful, the project will promote the public interest by improving the quality of issued patents. The public only benefits when monopoly rights are granted for inventions that truly represent a novel and inventive advance over the existing state of the art.  The benefit to innovators is that improving the quality of issued patents leads to clearer patent landscapes and reduces the uncertainty surrounding freedom to operate.\n The benefit to participating applicants is that their applications will undergo a more rigorous examination against the strictures of novelty and inventiveness and are likely to be more robust as a consequence.\n The more robust a patent, the more valuable it is and the less likely it is to be challenged, which is a benefit that represents significant cost savings over time to consumers, patent holders and the public at large.  More robust patents are less likely to be litigated or disputed in licensing discussions.  As a consequence, the marketplace for such inventions will be more efficient, with time and money not being wasted on ill-conceived litigation.  In addition, the identification and elimination of weak claims early in the examination process ultimately saves the applicant money by avoiding the expensive process of pursuing or enforcing non-meritorious patent claims.  Finally, it is anticipated that open peer review will encourage applicants to file better constructed and clearer applications and lower the incentive for those who might seek to file low quality applications.\n The review process in no way abrogates the responsibility of the patent examiner to assess a patent application.  Prior art submitted by Peer-to-Patent Australia is solely designed to assist a patent examiner.  The patent examiner remains the arbiter of whether a patent is to be granted.\n Peer-to-Patent has generated considerable support internationally.  The recent pilot projects run in the United States had the backing of users of the patent system such as IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, General Electric, Intel and Yahoo!, who all recognised potential of the project and put forward applications to be peer reviewed.\n So far, Peer-to-Patent Australia has the backing of IBM, Hewlett-Packard, General Electric, Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd and Residex Pty Ltd.\n Peer-to-Patent Australia will initially run as a six-month pilot. The first pilot project is set to launch on 9 November 2009.\n Up to 40 business method patent, computer software and related patent applications which are open for public inspection will each be posted on the Peer-to-Patent Australia website for a 90-day period.  During that time, members of community will be invited to review those patent applications, submit prior art references and comment on the relevance of any prior art that has been put forward.\n Each patent application included in the project will be open to peer review for a three-month period. During that time, members of the public can identify prior art references and comment on the relevance of any prior art that has been put forward. At the end of the review period, Peer-to-Patent Australia will forward the top 10 prior art submissions, as selected by the community of reviewers, to IP Australia for consideration in the examination process.\n Only applications that have been laid open for public inspection and for which an examination request has been made by the applicant will be included in the pilot. All attempts will be made to include patent applications from a broad range of patent applicants. No more than 10 patent applications from a single patent applicant, inventor, assignee or their affiliates shall be selected for inclusion in the pilot.\n The project uses a consent based model.  Patent applicants will be asked to consent to having their applications included in the pilot. Patent applicants will be asked to consent to having their applications included in the pilot.  A patent application will not be included in the pilot without the express written consent of the applicant or applicants.\n The objective of the pilot is to test whether an open community of reviewers can effectively locate prior art that might not otherwise be located by patent examiners during a typical examination.  This is an initiative that builds upon the growing trend to use modern Web 2.0 technology to enhance and invigorate government administration through citizen engagement.\n After the pilot period has concluded, IP Australia and the Queensland University of Technology will evaluate the project\u2019s success.\n Peer-to-Patent Australia is a joint initiative of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), IP Australia (which houses the Australian patent office). It is also the result of collaboration between of the Queensland University of Technology and New York Law School.\n Peer-to-Patent Australia is based upon the successful Peer-to-Patent projects run by the New York Law School in collaboration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and is part of a push to make Peer-to-Patent an international phenomenon.\n Except where otherwise noted, content on the Peer-to-Patent Australia web site is available for noncommercial use through a Creative Commons license.\n", " Kounotori 3 (Japanese: \u3053\u3046\u306e\u3068\u308a3\u53f7\u6a5f; English: \"white stork\"[1]), also known as HTV-3, is the third Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle. It was launched on 21 July 2012 to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) aboard the H-IIB Launch Vehicle No. 3 (H-IIB F3) manufactured by MHI and JAXA.[2] Kounotori 3 arrived at the ISS on 27 July 2012, and Expedition 32 Flight Engineer and JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide used the International Space Station's Canadarm2 robotic arm to install Kounotori 3, to its docking port on the Earth-facing side of the Harmony module at 14:34 GMT.[3]\n After the supplies are unloaded, Kounotori 3 was loaded with waste material from ISS, including used experiment equipment and used clothes. Then Kounotori 3 was unberthed from the ISS on September 11 and burned up upon reentering the atmosphere on September 14, 2012.\n Major changes of Kounotori 3 from previous Kounotori are:[4]\n Ground operation was improved to allow more late access cargo.\n Kounotori 3 carries approximately 4.6 tonnes cargo, consisting of 3.5 tonnes in pressurized compartment and 1.1 tonnes in unpressurized compartment.[4]\n Pressurized cargo consists of system equipment (61%), science experiments (20%), food (15%), and crew commodities (4%).\nIt includes: Aquatic Habitat (AQH),[5] JEM Small-Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD), five CubeSats (RAIKO, FITSAT-1, WE WISH, F-1, TechEdSat), i-Ball and REBR reentry data recorders, ISS SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization System (ISERV).[6]  Additionally, loaded onto Kounotori 3's Resupply Racks was NASA's Water Pump Assembly (WPA) catalytic reactor to replace the former unit that broke in March 2012 in orbit and a cooling water circulation pump to replace the old unit in the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) that also broke at the end of March.\n The high-tech aquarium (AQH) can be used to house small fish for up to 90 days. \"As a result, aquatic breeding over three generations, from fish parents to grandkids, previously impossible in space shuttle experiments, has become a reality,\" NASA said in a press kit.[7] The AQH experimental device will allow scientists and researchers to observe the birth of space aquatic creatures that have never experienced Earth's gravity, enabling them to better understand how the space environment affects animals beyond generations in preparation for potential long-term space travel in future. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) will be bred and observed in the AQH experimental device.\n Two experiments, originally designed by the winners of the international YouTube Space Lab competition, would examine how Bacillus subtilis and the jumping spider would react to microgravity.[8]\n The J-SSOD and five CubeSats are part of a technology experiment to test the feasibility of whether small satellites can be released without spacewalks. Using this method, satellites contained in bags will be launched facilitating future satellite design.\n During the destructive re-entry at the end of the Kounotori 3 mission, i-Ball will attempt to collect re-entry data. The globular- shaped i-Ball, a Re-entry Data Recorder produced in Japan, will descend using a parachute after withstanding the high heat of re-entry using ablative shielding and will send data after splashdown via an Iridium satellite.\nAlthough i-Ball will stay afloat for a while for data transmission, it will sink in the water eventually and will not be recovered.\n Unpressurized cargo consists of Multi-Mission Consolidated Equipment (MCE) and SCaN Testbed.[9]\n Aquatic Habitat experimental device\n The ISERV camera\n Kounotori 3 was launched aboard H-IIB rocket from Tanegashima Space Center at 02:06:18 UTC (11:06:18 JST) on 21 July 2012. The rocket flew smoothly arching out over the Pacific Ocean on a southeasterly trajectory 51.6 degrees titled to the Equator. Two minutes after liftoff, the four strap-on solid rocket boosters separated from the launch vehicle and fell away in pairs as planned.[10] The second stage then ignited and continued the push Kounotori 3 to orbit. Four minutes into the flight the H-IIB jettisoned the payload fairing and the first stage. After igniting the second stage engine, the H-IIB inserted Kounotori 3 into its preferred initial orbit with separation confirmed at 14 minutes and 53 minutes after liftoff.[11] Following the successful separation of Kounotori 3, the second stage engines were re-ignited for another time to perform a controlled re-entry test.[12] The second stage dropped into the South Pacific Ocean shortly afterwards. There were no apparent launch problems during the entire flight of the H-IIB rocket.\n At the time of the H-IIB launch, the weather was rainy, a wind speed was 2.3\u00a0m/s from the west-northwest and the temperature was 27.1 \u00b0C.\n In orbit, Kounotori 3 began a week-long phasing period where its orbit was gradually adjusted.[13] Kounotori 3 rendezvous burns were performed using four newly designed Japanese engines, as the two previous HTVs used engines made by US company Aerojet. During the same period Kounotori 3 underwent a series of pre-docking tests to precisely align the spacecraft with the ISS.\n The capture and berthing operations of HTV-3 took place on 27 July 2012. Upon reaching the communications zone, the spacecraft began to use the Proximity Operations system located in the JEM module on the ISS, to communicate with the station. Once Kounotori 3 was within about 30 feet and began station-keeping, Mission Control in Houston issued the space station crew the \"GO\" for capture of the spacecraft with the robotic arm of the space station. That command was radioed up by CAPCOM Catherine Coleman, who had performed the capture of Kounotori 2 in 2011.\n Kounotori 3 was placed into free-drift and NASA astronaut Joseph Acaba, operating the station's robot arm, captured the HTV's grapple fixture at 12:23 GMT. Then Robotic operators on the ground in Mission Control Houston (ROBO team) completed the maneuver of the HTV to the pre-berthing position at the nadir port (Earth facing) of the space station's Harmony module. The JAXA astronaut and flight engineer of Expedition 32/33 Akihiko Hoshide then resumed berthing operations, moving the spacecraft into the interface for installation. This marked the first time that a Japanese astronaut assisted in the capture of a Japanese spacecraft.[14] Sixteen remotely controlled bolts were gradually electrically driven in the common berthing mechanism at 14:24 GMT to finish the attachment of Kounotori 3 to the ISS at 14:34 GMT.\n Expedition 32 crew members opened the hatch of Kounotori 3 at 08:23 UTC on July 28, 2012 and entered Kounotori 3's Pressurized Logistics Carrier (PLC) to begin removing cargo supplies from inside the PLC.\n The Exposed Pallet (EP), which carried MCE and SCaN Testbed, was extracted from Kounotori's Unpressurized Logistics Carrier by Robotic operators on the ground using the ISS's robotic arm. The EP was then handed off to the JEM Robotic arm, being operated by Akihiko Hoshide, and installed to the Kibo's Exposed Facility on August 6.[15]  After MCE and SCaN Testbed were removed from the palette and installed to their places on ISS, Exposed Palette was returned to Kounotori on August 10.[16]\n JAXA astronaut Hoshide in the Cupola during the rendezvous operations\n Canadarm2 moves towards the HTV-3 for capture\n HTV-3 is grappled by the Canadarm2\n HTV-3 is gradually being moved towards its berthing location at the ISS\n Interior of HTV-3 photographed by an Expedition 32 crewmember\n Kounotori 3 was scheduled to be detached on September 6, but was postponed due to the scheduling of ISS activity.\n In preparation for unberthing, REBR and i-Ball reentry data recorders were installed and activated, and the hatch was closed on September 11.[17]\n Kounotori 3 was unberthed by SSRMS at 11:50 UTC, 11 September,[18] and released at 15:50 UTC, 12 September.[19]\nA few minutes after release when leaving from ISS, Kounotori 3 entered abort sequence, quickly leaving to fore of ISS orbit instead of the nominal gradual lower-fore trajectory.  SpaceFlightNow reported that it was triggered by a failure of In/Out Computer 2, citing daily space station status report posted on a NASA website.[20]  NASA's ISS On-Orbit Status does not mention any non-nominal event.[21]  At the press briefing, HTV Flight Director Takashi Uchiyama said that it was activated due to the residual motion of HTV after the release by SSRMS, which was considered to exceed the free fall bounding box before nominal activation of departure manoeuvre.[22] Later, Aviation Week reported that it was caused by the friction between Kounotori's grapple fixture and the station's robotic arm.[23]\n After de-orbit burns, Kounotori 3 entered atmosphere and was destroyed around 05:27 UTC on 14 September.[24]\ni-Ball and REBR reentry data recorders' data were retrieved successfully.[25][26]\n", " Bernard Howard Lavenda (born September 18, 1945) is a retired professor of chemical physics at the University of Camerino and expert on irreversible thermodynamics. He has contributed to many areas of physics, including that of Brownian motion, and in the establishment of the statistical basis of thermodynamics, and non-Euclidean geometrical theories of relativity. He was the scientific coordinator of the \"European Thermodynamics Network\" in the European Commission Program of Human Capital and Mobility. He was also a proponent for the establishment of, and scientific director of, a National (Italian) Centre for Thermodynamics, and has acted as scientific consultant to companies such as the ENI Group, where he helped to found TEMA, a consulting firm for SNAM Progetti, ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment), and the Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colorado. He has had over 130 scientific papers published in international journals, some critical of the new fashions and modes in theoretical physics.\n Professor Lavenda currently lives in Trevignano Romano near Rome, is married with two adult children and two grandchildren, for whom his textbook \"A New Perspective on Thermodynamics\" is dedicated.\n Bernard H. Lavenda was born in New York City. After completing secondary school in North Adams, Massachusetts, he attended Clark University where he graduated cum laude in 1966 with a B.Sc in chemistry. Having passed the entrance examination for the doctoral program at the Weizmann Institute of Science, he began experimental work on enzymes under the direction of Ephraim Katzir, who was later to become the President of Israel. Realizing that he was not made out for experimental work, he came under the influence of Ephraim's brother, Aaron, after reading his book Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics, coauthored with Peter Curran.\n After the Six Days War, Aaron Katchalsky helped him secure a studentship for a doctoral degree in Ilya Prigogine's group in Brussels.\n His doctoral thesis, \"Kinetic analysis and thermodynamic interpretation of nonequilibrium unstable transitions in open systems\", showed that when homogeneous nonlinear chemical reactions far from equilibrium on the thermodynamic branch, which is an extension of the law of mass action at equilibrium, become unstable they make transitions to kinetic branches with lower entropy production than the thermodynamic branch.\n This result was initially contested by Prigogine who reasoned from hydrodynamic instabilities, like the Rayleigh-Benard instability, which show a larger entropy production beyond the critical point in order to maintain spatial structures.  Prigogine later considered these spatial structures to be produced by unstable chemically diffusing systems, based on Alan Turing's morphological models, calling them 'dissipative structures' and for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977.\n Prigogine later acknowledged that such transitions to lower states of entropy reduction were possible since no  spatial structural changes were involved, and later incorporated Lavenda's work into a chapter  of his new book Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability, and Fluctuations, co-authored with Paul Glansdorff. \nAfter receiving his doctorate from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, with la plus grande distinction, he returned to Israel in 1970 to work as a post-doctoral student in the Physical Chemistry Department of the Hebrew University.\nDuring that period he published a short note in the Italian physics journal, Lettere Al Nuovo Cimento [3 (1972) 385-390] criticizing the Glansdorff-Prigogine universal criteria of evolution which attributes an inequality to a potential which is a function only of intensive   variables, the forces. He pointed out that no such thermodynamic potential could exist for it would be devoid of all information regarding how large the system is,  or how many particles it contains.  The inequality would be a criterion of stability, but, on account of the assumption of local (stable) equilibrium of the components that the system is broken up into, the sum of stable components can hardly become unstable. The note would probably have gone unnoticed were it not for Peter Landsberg's citation of  it in his Nature review of the Glansdorff-Prigogine book  [P. T. Landsberg, \"The fourth law of thermodynamics\"[1]], where he predicted \"the occasional lack of lucidity in the book which may give rise to some discussion within the next few years\".\n After the murder of Aharon Katzir in Lod Airport massacre in May 1972, Lavenda accepted a position of consultant at Nuovo Pignone in Florence Italy together with a teaching position at the University of Pisa.\nThrough  the vice President of Nuovo Pignone,  he came into contact with Vicenzo Gervasio who was later to become President of ENI Data, and the idea crystallized of setting up a company dedicated to the analysis and dynamic modeling of fouling processes in refineries and reactors. He established relations between ENI and Northwest Research, Boeing, and SERI (Solar Energy Research Institute). \nHe helped form a new company within the ENI group, TEMA, which was supported by SNAM Progetti. While retaining an unpaid lectureship in Thermodynamics at the University of Naples, Lavenda published his critical appraisal of the then current theories of irreversible thermodynamics, Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, in 1978. It was originally published by the Macmillan Press and later became a Dover Classic of Science and Mathematics.\n In 1980 he won a chair in Physical Chemistry. Transferring to Camerino, he was to spend more than three decades there.  \nHis first book during this period, \"Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics\", published by Wiley in 1985, developed the nonlinear generalization of the Onsager-Machlup formulation of nonequilibrium fluctuations which was restricted to linear (Gaussian) processes.  \nJust as equilibrium is characterized by the state of maximum entropy, corresponding to maximum probability,  nonequlibrium states are characterized by the principle of least dissipation of energy, corresponding to the maximum probability of a transition between nonequilibrium states that are not well-separated in time. \nThis principle can be generalized to non-Gaussian fluctuations in the limit of small thermal noise and constitutes a kinetic analog to Boltzmann's principle.\n During a sabbatical year in 1986 in Porto Alegre, Lavenda had ample time to browse through the well-furnished library at the Universidade Federale di Rio Grande del Sud. \nHe was impressed by the parallelism between statistical inference and statistical thermodynamics: two distinct and separate branches that are essentially working on the same problems but with no apparent connection. \nHis work, summarized in Statistical Physics: A Probabilistic Approach, published by Wiley-Interscience in 1991, completes Boltzmann's principle, which expresses the entropy as the logarithm of a combinatorial factor, by showing that the entropy is the potential that determines Gauss\u2019 law of error for which the average value is the most probable value.\nJust as there are frequency and degree- of-belief (Bayes' theorem) interpretations of statistical inference, the same should apply to statistical thermodynamics.  The frequency interpretation applies to extensive variables, like energy and volume which can be sampled, while the degree-of-belief  interpretations applies to the intensive variables, like temperature and pressure, for which sampling has no meaning.  The connection between the two branches translates the Cramer-Rao inequality into thermodynamic uncertainty relations, analogous to quantum mechanical uncertainty relations, where the more knowledge we have about a thermodynamic variable the less we know about its conjugate. \nSince the lack of a probability distribution means the absence of its statistics, the possibility of an intermediate statistics, or what is referred to as parastatistics, between Bose\u2013Einstein statistics and Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics is nonexistent.\n Statistical thermodynamics is usually concerned with most probable behavior which becomes almost certainty if large enough samples are taken. \nBut sometimes surprises are in store where extreme behavior becomes the prevalent one.\nTurning his attention to such rare events Lavenda published Thermodynamics of Extremes in 1995, whose real interest lies in the formulation of a thermodynamics of earthquakes that was subsequently published in Annali di Geofisica (Extreme value statistics and thermodynamics of earthquakes: \"Large earthquakes\";[2] \"aftershock sequences\"[3]), and which is gaining increasing attention.\nBy properly defining entropy and energy, a temperature can be associated to an aftershock sequence giving it an additional means of characterization. \nA new magnitude-frequency relation is predicted which applies to clustered after-shocks in contrast to the [Gutenberg-Richter law] which treats them as independent and identically distributed random events.\n In the nineties, Lavenda saw thermodynamics as a cultural heritage that could have a place in Italian society, and would be pertinent to both industrial research and to the preservation of its artistic patrimony. \nHe was a proponent for the establishment of a National Centre of Thermodynamics for which financial funding was unavailable.  Capturing the interest of the ENEA, or the Italian agency for alternative energy resources, he applied for funding in the European Commission of Human Capital and Mobility Programme. \nHis project, \"Thermodynamics of Complex Systems\", came in sixth place in Chemistry section with maximum funding in 1992.\nThis led to the formation of a European Thermodynamics Network consisting of 16 partners in the EU and Switzerland.\nIt was later extended to the Eastern European Countries in the European Commission PECO Programme.  This eventually led to the establishment of a National Centre for Thermodynamics that was brought into existence by the ENEA, but lasted only several months, because European funds were absorbed by other projects[4]\n Often critical of new fashions and modes in thermodynamics, Lavenda wrote A New Perspective on Thermodynamics,[5] published in 2009, by returning to Carnot's original conception that work can only be done when there is a difference in temperature, and the necessity of closing the cycle before that work can be assessed.\nMore recently Lavenda has directed his interests to relativity by providing it with a new foundation based on non-Euclidean geometries. \nRather than measuring distances in terms of the usual Euclidean metric, distances are defined in terms of what is known as a cross-ratio, a perspective invariant of four points, which, for the space of velocities, just happens to be the compounding of longitudinal Doppler shifts.  Doppler shifts are fundamental to relativity: oblique Doppler shifts describe aberration, while second order ones describe length contraction, but rather than being in the direction of the motion are perpendicular to it.[6]\nThe uniformly rotating disc, which is considered by some to be the missing link in Einstein's formulation of general relativity, is exactly described by the hyperbolic metric in polar coordinates, named after the nineteenth century Italian geometer Eugenio Beltrami, which predicts the circumference of the disc to be greater when in motion than when it is at rest.\nThus a uniformly rotating disc belongs to hyperbolic, and not Euclidean, space and so, too, does relativity.\n", " \n View from the Top is a 2003 American romantic comedy film directed by Bruno Barreto and starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Christina Applegate, Candice Bergen, Joshua Malina, Mark Ruffalo, Rob Lowe, Mike Myers, and Kelly Preston. The film follows a young woman (Paltrow) from a small town who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant.\n Donna Jensen is a girl from a small town in Nevada who wishes to see the world in order to get away from her unhappy life of living in a trailer with her alcoholic mother, a former Las Vegas showgirl, and her abusive, alcoholic stepfather, where she feels miserable and lonely. After graduating from high school, Donna tries to make ends meet by working as a clerk in a Big Lots.\n After her boyfriend, Tommy, leaves her for another girl, she goes to a bar where she sees a talk show segment about Sally Weston, who has written a memoir called My Life in the Sky, and decides to follow her destiny by becoming a flight attendant. Her first position is at a small, seedy California commuter airline called Sierra, where she works with Sherry, a senior attendant, and also gets an intern herself, named Christine. After working for several months, this success builds up her confidence and encourages her to attend open interviews for Royalty Airlines. She convinces Sherry and Christine to join her at Royalty Airlines. While Christine and Donna get in, Sherry does not, and remains in Sierra Airlines.\n After getting the job, Donna puts her heart and soul into the training camp, and, after meeting Weston, she is determined to be assigned to the top route, \"Paris, First Class, International\". Alas, when the assignments are posted, Donna is shocked and disappointed to discover that, instead of the top route, she has been assigned to a commuter route in Cleveland. Christine, who had initially struggled with the material and procedures, has inexplicably been assigned the high-priority New York City route, much to the dismay of Donna.\n A few months later, by chance, Donna runs into Christine in Cleveland. Donna knows from previous experience that Christine has the airplane soap from Sally's house during their training sessions, but is still shocked when Christine empties her handbag to reveal all manner of Royalty Air items. Even the smallest theft is strictly prohibited by Royalty Airlines, and could mean termination. Still sure there was some sort of error in her route assignment, Donna turns to Weston for help. Through a course of events, Donna discovers that Christine had switched their test booklets when they were being handed up to their trainer.\n With that, Donna realizes that Christine has cheated her way to the top route, wanting success herself but knowing that Donna would do better. When Sally asks to have airline security spy on Christine's flight\u2014to see if she stole any property (a code blue)\u2014Christine gets caught and is fired. Donna gets the chance to re-take her exam and achieves a perfect score, resulting in being assigned a Paris, First Class, International route. However, following her \"destiny\" means deciding between a boyfriend, Ted, and her career. She chooses the latter.\n Though she gets all that she wants\u2014Paris, first class, etc.\u2014Donna realizes that she is still unhappy. She misses Ted terribly, and with Weston's encouragement, she returns to Cleveland to meet him. She does, and after a heartfelt speech to his deaf grandmother, which he overhears, the two reconcile. The film ends with Donna wishing her passengers well as they land in Cleveland, now moving her position from a flight attendant to a pilot.\n View from the Top opened on March 21, 2003 (it was originally scheduled for Christmas 2001, but in light of the September 11 attacks and due to the fact that the story revolves around a flight attendant on numerous planes, the release was pushed back) and grossed $7,009,513 in its opening weekend, ranking number four behind Bringing Down the House, Dreamcatcher, and Agent Cody Banks.[2] The film would eventually gross $15,614,000 domestically and $3,912,014 internationally, totaling $19,526,014 worldwide, below the production budget of $30 million.[3]\n On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 14% based on reviews from 123 critics, with the site's consensus \"Uneven in tone and badly edited, A View From the Top wastes the talents of its cast and condescends to its characters.\"[4] Paltrow herself later disparaged the film, calling it \"the worst movie ever\".[5]\n", " Sycze [\u02c8s\u0268t\u0361\u0282\u025b] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Nurzec-Stacja, within Siemiatycze County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland, close to the border with Belarus.[1] It lies approximately 7 kilometres (4\u00a0mi) south-west of Nurzec-Stacja, 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) east of Siemiatycze, and 77\u00a0km (48\u00a0mi) south of the regional capital Bia\u0142ystok.\n The village has a population of 160.\n \n Coordinates: 52\u00b025\u203247\u2033N 23\u00b00\u203214\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff52.42972\u00b0N 23.00389\u00b0E\ufeff / 52.42972; 23.00389\n", " Kumru is a khum (commune) of Thma Puok District in Banteay Meanchey Province in north-western Cambodia.[1]\n Coordinates: 13\u00b057\u2032N 103\u00b003\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff13.950\u00b0N 103.050\u00b0E\ufeff / 13.950; 103.050\n", " \n Sir Bruce Anthony John Ponder FMedSci FRS (born 25 April 1944) is an English geneticist and cancer researcher. He is Emeritus Professor of Oncology at the University of Cambridge and former director of the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute.\n Ponder was educated at Charterhouse School and Jesus College, Cambridge.[1] He carried out his PhD studies with Lionel Crawford in London working on chromatin organisation and DNA sequence specificity using polyoma virus.[4]\n Ponder became interested in cancer genetics in the 1970s, when he saw the potential to use new methods of linkage analysis (using restriction fragment length polymorphisms) to identify genes that predispose to cancer. His team pinpointed the RET gene as the cause of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.[5] During the 1990s, Ponder co-founded and chaired the International Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium, which led to the identification of breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA2 specifically was identified by a team including Ponder and led by Mike Stratton.[6][7][8][9]\n In 1996, Ponder became Cancer Research Campaign (now Cancer Research UK) Professor of Oncology in Cambridge (in 2007 the chair was re-endowed as the Li Ka Shing Professor of Oncology). He served as co-director of the Strangeways Research Laboratory for Genetic Epidemiology and co-director of the Hutchison/MRC Research Centre.[10]\n Ponder was the inaugural Director of the CRUK Cambridge Research Institute (now called the CRUK Cambridge Institute) when it opened in 2007. In this role he put an emphasis on building infrastructure across the research pathway, from basic science through translational research, ensuring that research has clinical impact. He was director of the Cambridge Cancer Centre, a collaboration between the Institute, the University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Hospital, guiding the centre to OECI Comprehensive Cancer Centre status in 2013.[11]\n In 1997 Ponder delivered the Croonian Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians on the subject of the RET gene.[12] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001,[13] he was knighted for Services to Medicine in the 2008 New Year Honours list,[14] and was awarded the 2013 Cancer Research UK Lifetime Achievement Prize.[15] His nomination for the Royal Society reads: \n", " Tyler Portis Hicks (born July 9, 1969) is a Pulitzer Prize winning [1] photojournalist who works as a staff photographer for The New York Times.

Bipolar cells are  specialized sensory neurons for the transmission of special senses. As such, they are part of the sensory pathways for smell, sight, taste, hearing and vestibular functions.\n Common examples are the bipolar cell of the retina, the ganglia of the vestibulocochlear nerve,[1] and the extensive use of bipolar cells to transmit efferent (motor) signals to control muscles.\n Oftentimes found in the retina, bipolar cells are crucial as they serve as both direct and indirect cell pathways. The specific location of the bipolar cells allow them to facilitate the pathway of signals both where they start in the receptors as well as where they arrive at the ganglion cells. Bipolar cells in the retina are also unique as they do not fire impulses like the other cells found within the retina. Rather, bipolar cells have a receptive-field that surrounds them. Therefore, bipolar cells may exist as off-center or on-center. The off-center bipolar cells possess excitatory relationships with the synapses and are hyperpolarized by light. On-center bipolar cells have inhibitory synapses and therefore are suppressed in the dark.[2]\n Bipolar neurons exist within the vestibular nerve as it is responsible for special sensory sensations including hearing, equilibrium and motion detection. The majority of the bipolar neurons belonging to the vestibular nerve exist within the vestibular ganglion with axons extending into the maculae of utricle and saccule as well as into the ampullae of the semicircular canals.[3]\n Bipolar cells are also found in the spinal ganglia, when the cells are in an embryonic condition.\n Sometimes the extensions, also called processes, come off from opposite poles of the cell, and the cell then assumes a spindle shape; in other cells both processes emerge at the same point.\n In some cases where two fibers are apparently connected with a cell, one of the fibers is really derived from an adjoining nerve cell and is passing to end in a ramification around the ganglion cell, or, again, it may be coiled helically around the nerve process which is issuing from the cell.\n Retinal Bipolar Cell\n This article incorporates text in the public domain from page 722 of\u00a0the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n", " January\u00a05, 2019; 5 months ago\u00a0(2019-01-05)[2]\n SketchUp, formerly Google Sketchup, is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications such as architectural, interior design, landscape architecture, civil and mechanical engineering, film and video game design.

A new site was provided, Extension Warehouse, hosting plugins and extensions for Sketchup.[20]\n SketchUp comes in multiple editions; all are proprietary software.\n SketchUp Pro includes the functionality of SketchUp Make plus importers and exporters to common 2D and 3D formats, access to LayOut (2D documentation software) and Style Builder (create custom edge styles for SketchUp models).[21] SketchUp Pro 2016 has native integration with Trimble Connect, treat 3D Warehouse models as references, a totally rebuilt Generate Report and now LayOut offers web-friendly reference objects as well as a new LayOut API.[22]\n SketchUp Pro licensing is cross-platform and works on both Windows and Mac machines.\n SketchUp Shop is a version of SketchUp specifically for DIY designers, makers, and woodworkers. It has a feature set designed to meet their needs (e.g. interface with 3D printers, CNC routers and other shop machines).  A major difference between Shop and Pro is that SketchUp Shop is a web application that you run in a browser while connected to the Internet whereas SketchUp Pro is a downloadable application that you can use offline.[23]\n In November 2017, SketchUp Free was released as a web-based application which replaces SketchUp Make.[24] Drawings can be saved to cloud, saved locally as native SKP file or exported as a STL file. Compared to Make, SketchUp Free does not support extensions and creation and editing of materials.\n Sketchup Make (formerly SketchUp for Home and Personal Use), introduced in May 2013, is a free-of-charge version for home, personal and educational use.[25] It begins with a 30-day trial of SketchUp Pro. After that time, users can agree to the Terms of Service and continue to use SketchUp Make for free. There will be no further releases of Make after November 2017; users are expected to migrate to SketchUp Free, though the installer remains available for download.\n 3D Warehouse is an open library in which SketchUp users may upload and download 3D models to share. The models can be downloaded right into the program without anything having to be saved onto your computer's storage. File sizes of the models can be up to 50 MB. Anyone can make, modify and re-upload content to and from the 3D warehouse free of charge.[26] All the models in 3D Warehouse are free, so anyone can download files for use in SketchUp or even other software such as AutoCAD, Revit and ArchiCAD - all of which have apps allowing the retrieval of models from 3D Warehouse. Since 2014 Trimble has launched a new version of 3D Warehouse where companies may have an official page with their own 3D catalog of products. Trimble is currently investing in creating 3D developer partners in order to have more professionally modeled products available in 3D Warehouse. According to the Trimble, 3D Warehouse is the most popular 3D content site on the web. SketchUp designers may visit 3D Warehouse to discover new products or for inspiration when designing their own.\n SketchUp holds U.S. Patent 6,628,279, granted in September 2003, on its \"Push/Pull\" technology.\n SketchUp 4 and later support software extensions written in the Ruby programming language, which add specialized functionality. Many such extensions are available to others on the Trimble Extension Warehouse[27] and many other 3rd party websites as well. SketchUp has a Ruby console, an environment which allows experimentation with Ruby.[28]\n SketchUp Free, the web-based version, does not support extensions which severely limits the functionality of the tool.\n SketchUp Viewer is a paid app released by Trimble.[29] It is available on iOS, Android, and Microsoft HoloLens.\n Cubits for iPad and iOS is a 3D interactive model viewer/renderer.[30] It can view .kmz files from SketchUp either as attachments through e-mail or via Dropbox.\n IrisVR Prospect software allows users to view SketchUp files in virtual reality with the use of head mounted displays such as the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift.[31]\n Kubity \u2014 the first mixed reality multiplex, is a system to instantly visualize 3D models on multiple devices: desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, augmented reality gear and virtual reality glasses.

Its last was assigned to the 9th Weather Reconnaissance Wing at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, where it was inactivated in 1974.\n Activated as the 400th Fighter Squadron in early 1943 under Fourth Air Force; spent World War II in the United States as an Operational Training Unit (OTU), initially equipped with P-39 Airacobras for advanced fighter training. Reassigned to Third Air Force in 1944, becoming a Replacement Training Unit (RTU) for A-36 Apache fighter-dive bomber ground attack aircraft.\n Reassigned to Stuttgart AAB, Arkansas in 1945 and redesignated as the 58th Reconnaissance Squadron (Weather), a long-range strategic weather reconnaissance squadron, training with B-25 Mitchells and long-ranger P-61C Black Widow Night Fighters modified for weather reconnaissance missions. Reassigned to Rapid City AAB, South Dakota in late 1945, using P-61Cs as part of a NACA/Air Weather Service Thunderstorm Project to learn more about thunderstorms and to use this knowledge to better protect civil and military airplanes that operated in their vicinity. The P-61's radar and particular flight characteristics enabled it to find and penetrate the most turbulent regions of a storm, and return crew and instruments intact for detailed study. Inactivated in 1946 as part of the general demobilization of the AAF.\n Reactivated as part of Strategic Air Command in 1951 in Alaska, Equipped with very long range WB-29 Superfortresses 1951, upgrading to extended long-range WB-50D Superfortresses in 1956. Conducted long-range weather flights over the Arctic and along the northern periphery of the Soviet Union; the aircraft being equipped with sensors for detecting radioactive debris to gather evidence when the Soviets tested nuclear devices. Inactivated in 1958 as part of the phaseout of the WB-50s from SAC and development of faster jet aircraft for the long-range intelligence mission.\n The squadron was reactivated in 1963 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, assuming the assets of the discontinued 1211th Test Squadron.[3] The squadron was equipped with twelve RB-57F Canberra (later WB-57F) reconnaissance aircraft. Most of the RB-57Fs were converted B-57Ds (a few were B-57Bs) equipped with two TF33 engines in place of the B-57B's J65, plus a pair of auxiliary J60s for high altitude and long range reconnaissance.[4] Part of their duties involved high-altitude atmospheric sampling and radiation detection work in support of nuclear test monitoring. Over the next decade the RB-57Fs were flown on a worldwide basis at very high altitudes at high speeds. Stress cracks began appearing in the wing spars and ribs of the RB-57Fs after a few years of service. Some were sent to General Dynamics for repairs. Due to the excessive cost of repairing all the aircraft, nine were placed in storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in 1972.\n The 58th WRS, the last squadron in the Air Force to use the WB-57F Canberra, was inactivated on July 1, 1974, after placing its planes in storage at Davis-Monthan.\n \u00a0This article incorporates\u00a0public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.\n Further reading\n", "  U.S. Route\u00a0411 (US\u00a0411) is an alternate parallel-highway associated with US\u00a011. US\u00a0411 extends for about 313 miles (504\u00a0km) from US\u00a078 in Leeds, Alabama, to US\u00a025W/US\u00a070 in Newport, Tennessee. US\u00a0411 travels through northeastern Alabama, northwestern Georgia, and southeastern Tennessee. Notable towns and cities along its route include Gadsden, Alabama; Rome, Georgia; Cartersville, Georgia; Maryville, Tennessee; Sevierville, Tennessee, and Newport, Tennessee.\n US\u00a0411 and US\u00a011 never intersect with one another, though they come very close in Leeds, Alabama, Gadsden, Alabama, and Maryville, Tennessee. US\u00a0411 also spends much of its route close to the Interstate Highway System: Interstate 40 (I-40), I-75, and I-59, though it never has an interchange with I-59.\n Most of the terrain through which US\u00a0411 passes is rural countryside, with no major metropolitan areas directly along its route. However, it does pass relatively near the major cities of Birmingham, Alabama, Chattanooga, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee. In Sevier County, Tennessee, south of Knoxville, US\u00a0411 is used by many tourists as a route to the northern side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. US\u00a0411 passes approximately 20 miles (32\u00a0km) north of the national park, but intersects with US\u00a0441, which actually goes through this park. Although US\u00a0411 has a south\u2013north designation, it contains long stretches that are west\u2013east, and its overall direction is actually southwest\u2013northeast.\n US\u00a0411 is generally a two-lane highway through the countryside. However, it has long been a four-lane, divided highway connecting Rome and Cartersville, Georgia, and it is a multi-lane highway connecting Cartersville with I-75. Also, for part of its route in the Cartersville area, US\u00a0411 shares a four-lane, divided highway with US\u00a041. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Transportation completed a project to widen the highway to four lanes between Maryville and Ocoee, Tennessee.\n US 411 begins at US 78 (Parkway Drive) in the city of Leeds in far eastern Jefferson County. SR 25, the U.S. Highway's companion route, continues south as a signed highway that briefly follows US 78 east before splitting south toward Harpersville. US 411 heads north along two-lane 9th Street, which has a pair of at-grade crossings of Norfolk Southern Railway rail lines. The street's name changes to Whitmire Street, which the U.S. Highway follows to Ashville Road. US 411 follows Ashville Road, a two-lane road with center turn lane, northeast into St. Clair County, where the highway expands to four lanes. The U.S. Highway meets I-20 at a partial cloverleaf interchange as it leaves the city of Leeds. US 411 continues as two-lane Moody Parkway northeast through the Cahaba Valley formed by the Little Cahaba River between Pine Ridge to the west and Oak Ridge to the east. The highway has a brief concurrency with SR 174 through Odenville, where the highways pass under a CSX rail line.\n US 411 continues northeast through the Beaver Creek Valley between Pine Ridge and the Beaver Creek Mountains. The highway leaves the valley after it joins US 231 (Heart of Dixie Highway) to pass through Pine Ridge to the city of Ashville. The U.S. Highways enter town along 5th Street and proceed to the county courthouse, where they meet the eastern end of SR 23 (6th Avenue). Both highways turn east onto 6th Avenue, then US-231 turns north onto Court Street East. US 411 leaves Ashville along Rainbow Drive, which heads northeast between Big Canoe Creek and Canoe Creek Mountain to the south. The U.S. Highway crosses the mountain and enters Etowah County where it crosses the Big Canoe Creek branch of Neely Henry Lake. US 411 follows the western flank of Dunaway mountain to Rainbow City, where the route intersects SR 77 (Grand Avenue).\n US 411 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it enters the city of Gadsden. The highway crosses the Big Wills Creek branch of Neely Henry Lake and meets the eastern end of I-759 at a partial cloverleaf interchange; that freeway continues east as SR 759. US 411 veers onto Albert Rains Boulevard, which follows the right bank of the Coosa River through downtown Gadsden. The highway passes by the Spirit of American Citizenship Monument and under Broad Street, a CSX rail line, and US 278 and US 431 (Meighan Boulevard), which access US 411 via a partial cloverleaf interchange. US 411 leaves (or will soon exit) Gadsden along a newly constructed four-lane divided highway that passes between Shinbone Ridge to the west and several loops of the Coosa River. The U.S. Highway drops to two lanes before it enters Cherokee County, then expands again to a four-lane divided highway, Weiss Lake Boulevard.\n US 411 curves east along the northern edge of Weiss Lake and intersects SR 68 (Industrial Boulevard) in the town of Leesburg, east of which US 411 and SR 68 cross the lake, an impoundment of the Coosa River. Shortly after entering the city of Centre, the U.S. Highway and state highway turn onto the Clarence E. Chestnut Jr. Bypass, a four-lane road with center turn lane; US 411 Business and SR 25 continue along Main Street into the center of town. SR 68 diverges from the U.S. Highway at Cedar Bluff Road, which carries SR 283 southwest toward downtown. SR 283 becomes US 411's companion route on the bypass, which next intersects SR 9 (Armory Road), which intersects SR 68 immediately to the north. US 411 drops to two lanes east of SR 9 and curves south to collect the east end of US 411 Business (Main Street) and SR 25 on the eastern edge of Centre. US 411 continues east and crosses Cowan Creek before reaching the Alabama\u2013Georgia state line and the northern terminus of SR 25 east of the hamlet of Forney.\n US 411 enters Georgia at the western terminus of its companion SR 53 in the southwestern corner of Floyd County. The two-lane highway, which is named Gadsden Road, has a brief concurrency with SR 100, which heads north as Fosters Mill Road and south as Mill Street, on the west side of the town of Cave Spring. US 411 enters town along Alabama Street and leaves to the northeast along Rome Street. The U.S. Highway continues as Cave Spring Road, which crosses Cedar Creek and passes through Vans Valley. US 411 passes under the West Rome Bypass and intersects US 27 and SR 1 (Cedartown Highway), which US 411 joins heading north. The four-lane road with center turn lane passes along the west side of Lindale and between Walker Mountain and Booze Mountain on the west and east, respectively.\n US 411 and US 27 expand to a divided highway as they enter the city of Rome and then a four-lane freeway as they cross over a Norfolk Southern rail line. The freeway has a diamond interchange with Darlington Drive and Old Lindale Road and a half-diamond interchange with Maple Road. Immediately to the east of the second interchange, US 411 passes through a directional T interchange; US 27, SR 1, SR 20, and SR 53 head north toward downtown Rome and US 411 and SR 20 head east. Immediately to the east of the split, the U.S. Highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 101 (Dean Avenue); there is no ramp from SR 101 to westbound US 411. The freeway ends east of SR 101. US 411 has an intersection with the southern end of SR 1 Loop (East Rome Bypass) before leaving the city limits.\n US 411 heads east along Cartersville Highway into Bartow County. The four-lane divided highway parallels and then crosses the Etowah River. US 411 crosses over an east\u2013west CSX rail line immediately before its trumpet interchange with US 41 and SR 3 (Joe Frank Harris Parkway). The two U.S. Highways head southeast into the city of Cartersville then diverge immediately to the east of a north\u2013south CSX rail line at the boulevard's partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 61 (Tennessee Street). Immediately to the north of the interchange, SR 20 (Canton Highway) splits east and SR 61 becomes US 411's companion highway toward Tennessee. The U.S. Highway heads north as a four-lane undivided highway that becomes divided temporarily through the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-75 (Larry McDonald Memorial Highway).\n US 411 drops to two lanes south of the town of White, where the highway begins to closely parallel the north\u2013south CSX rail line. The U.S. Highway intersects SR 140 (Henry Mack Hill Road) in the hamlet of Rydal before entering Gordon County. US 411 passes through the town of Fairmount as Salacoa Street; the U.S. Highway runs concurrently with SR 53 between Calhoun Street and Fairmount Highway. North of the town of Ranger, through which the route is named Tennessee Highway, the highway meets the eastern end of SR 156 (Red Bud Road). US 411 passes through the town of Oakman, then diverges from a road called Old Highway 411, crosses to the west side of the railroad, intersects SR 136 (Nicklesville Road), and enters Murray County. The U.S. Highway passes to the west of Reregulation Reservoir and Carters Lake, both impoundments of the Coosawattee River, which the highway crosses to the west of the lakes.\n US 411 intersects US 76 and SR 282, which follow part of Old Highway 411 before heading east through the Cohutta Mountains, and the U.S. Highways begin to run concurrently as a four-lane undivided highway along the west flank of Fort Mountain. US 411 and US 76 continue as 3rd Avenue through the city of Chatsworth. In the center of town, the highways intersect Fort Street, which carries SR 2 and SR 52 east toward Fort Mountain and State Route 52 Alternate to the west. At the north end of town, US 76 and SR 52 leave US 411 along G.I. Maddox Boulevard. The U.S. Highway passes along the west flank of Camp Ground Mountain and is named Hill Street through the town of Eton, where the route meets the eastern end of SR 286 (Coffey Road) and drops to two lanes. US 411 passes through the town of Crandall, crosses to the east side of the railroad, and follows the Fairy Valley to the hamlet of Cisco, where SR 2 splits to the west. US 411 crosses over to the west side of the rail line in the hamlet of Tennga immediately before reaching the Georgia\u2013Tennessee state line, where SR 61 has its northern terminus.\n US 411 enters Tennessee at the southern terminus of its companion SR 33 in the southwestern corner of Polk County. The highway crosses the Conasauga River in the hamlet of Conasauga and meets the eastern end of SR 313 (Ladd Springs Road) in Oldfort. US 411 parallels the CSX rail line through the hamlet of Ocoee, where the highway expands to four lanes plus a center turn lane and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 64 and US 74 (SR 40). North of Ocoee, US 411 crosses over the railroad and the Ocoee River and passes through the town of Benton, where the route meets the northern end of SR 314 (Parksville Road). The U.S. Highway expands to a divided highway north of the town. US 411 intersects and begins to run concurrently with SR 30, crosses the Hiwassee River, and meets the eastern end of SR 163 in the village of Delano.\n US 411 becomes undivided and crosses over the CSX rail line shortly after entering McMinn County. In the town of Etowah, the highway follows Tennessee Avenue, meets the western end of SR 310 (Mecca Pike), and SR 30 splits west along David M. Lilliard Memorial Highway. The highway becomes divided once again north of town and continues through farmland and countryside before becoming undivided once again before entering the town of Englewood and goes through town passing just east of the downtown area and intersecting and having a short concurrency with SR 39 (Athens Pike; Tellico Street). US 411 then becomes a divided highway again as it leaves Englewood and enters countryside once again before crossing into Monroe County.\n US 411 continues through countryside before entering the city of Madisonville and becomes undivided for a short distance before having an intersection with its former alignment, which travels through downtown (Old US Highway 411), before becoming divided and having a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 68 (New Highway 68), which provides access to Sweetwater, The Lost Sea, Tellico Plains, Cherohala Skyway and the Cherokee National Forest, before going along a bypass of downtown as a divided highway passing through a major business district. US 411 then has an grade-separated interchange with its former alignment (Warren Street) before becoming undivided before leaving Madisonville and continuing north as a 4-lane divided highway through farmland and countryside. US 411 then comes to an intersection and becomes concurrent with SR 72 (Loudon Highway) just before entering the town of Vonore and becoming undivided once again as this time it passes straight through downtown instead of bypassing it. It has an intersection SR 360, which provides access to Fort Loudoun and Fort Loudoun State Park, before leaving Vonore via crossing a bridge over the Little Tennessee River/Tellico Lake before SR 72 splits off and goes east following the banks of the lake before becoming divided once again before crossing into Loudon County. \n It then becomes undivided shortly afterwards though it doesn't pass by any businesses or towns as it stays in farmland as it becomes known as Greenback Road. It then passes just south of the community of Greenback and meeting the southern end of SR 95, which provides access to the community. US 411 then continues through countryside and farmland to cross into Blount County. \n US 411 countinues through farmland as an undivided 4-lane highway and has an intersection with SR 336 northeast of the community of Lanier. It then continues through farmland before entering the city of Maryville and becoming concurrent with US 129 (SR 115) (Calderwood Highway; provides access to Calderwood, Tallassee, and the Tail of the Dragon) and pass by a few businesses before really entering the business district at the intersection with SR 335 (William Blount Drive). They continue through a major business district before coming to grade-separated interchange where US 411 and US 129 split with US 129 bypassing downtown to enter Alcoa and provide access to McGhee Tyson Airport and Knoxville and US 411 continues north into downtown next to Foothills Mall. US 411 continues into downtown, as Broadway Avenue, and comes to an intersection with US 321 (SR 73) (Lamar Alexander Parkway; provides access to Walland, Townsend, Wears Valley, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park). It then has another intersection with SR 336 before traveling through the center and most historic part of the city before coming to an intersection with SR 35 (Hall Road/Washington Street), with SR 33 continuing north to Knoxville and US 411 turning right to become concurrent with SR 35 (its new companion route). It follows Washington Street for a short distance before turning left onto Sevierville Road, at an intersection with SR 447 (Washington Street), and leaves downtown. It then passes by Blount Memorial Hospital before going through some neighborhoods before leaving Maryville and continues as a narrow 2-lane highway through countryside and farmland and crosses the Little River in the community of Wildwood. It then continues through countryside and farmland, passing by 411 Speedway, before crossing into Sevier County.\n US 411 immediately enters the community, through large enough to be a medium-sized city, of Seymour and goes through some neighborhoods before coming to an intersection with US 441 (SR 71; Chapman Highway; provides access to Knoxville) and SR 338 (Boyds Creek Highway; provides access to Kodak and Douglas Dam), with US 411/SR 35 turning right to become concurrent with US 441/SR 71 and continue as an undivided 4-lane highway through the heart of Seymour before leaving Seymour and some mountains and becoming narrow and curvy, though it maintains 4-lanes throughout. After several miles it then widens out to a 4-lane divided highway and stays that until it enters the city of Sevierville where it becomes undivided once again. They intersect with Old Knoxville Highway before crossing the Pigeon River and entering downtown at the intersection with SR 66 (Winfield Dunn Parkway; provides access to I-40), which is where US 441/SR 71 splits off, as Forks of the River Parkway, to go to Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and US 411/SR 35 continue straight into downtown. It goes through downtown as Main Street and has an intersection with SR 448 (North Parkway/Parkway) before leaving downtown at the crossing of Middle Creek, where it transitions to Dolly Parton Parkway. It continues through a major business district and has an intersection with SR 449 (Veterans Boulevard; provides access to Dollywood and Pigeon Forge). It then passes by some more businesses before leaving Sevierville and entering the community of Cherokee Hills, near the intersection with SR 416 (Pittman Center Road; provides access to Pittman Center and Gatlinburg). It then has an intersection with SR 339 (Long Springs Road; provides access to Cosby) before leaving Cherokee Hills and narrowing to an improved 2-lane Highway. It then passes through the community of New Center before having a sharp switchback and becoming narrow before crossing into Jefferson County.\n After crossing the county line, US 411 immediately enters the community of Chestnut Hill and has an intersection with SR 92 next to the Bush Bean Museum, which also right across the road from the Bush Brothers and Company Cannery plant and corporate headquarters. US 411 then enters some mountains and becomes curvy for a short distance before widening to a new 4-lane divided highway just before crossing into Cocke County.\n It continues along the new 4-lane highway into  the city of Newport and ends at its national northern terminus at an intersection with US 25W/US 70 (SR 9) just a short distance away from that route's interchange with I-40 (Exit 432 A-B; though exit 432 A is only signed as US 411 on the interstate in both directions), with SR 35 turning right to become concurrent with, though unsigned, that route towards downtown.\n", " Zabol County (Persian: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0632\u0627\u0628\u0644\u200e) is a county in Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Iran.

As a result of character attacks, individuals may be rejected by their professional community or members of their social or cultural environment. The process of CA may resemble an annihilation of human life as the damage sustained can last a lifetime. For some historical figures, that damage endures for centuries.\n CA may involve exaggeration, misleading half-truths, or manipulation of facts to present an untrue picture of the targeted person. It is a form of defamation and can be a form of ad hominem argument.\n The phrase \"character assassination\" became popular from around 1930.[2] This concept, as a subject of scholarly study, was originally introduced by Davis (1950)[3] in his collection of essays revealing the dangers of political smear campaigns. Six decades later Icks and Shiraev (2014)[4] rejuvenated the term and revived academic interest by addressing and comparing a variety of historical character assassination events.\n Character attacks are by definition intentional: they are launched to damage an individual's reputation in the eyes of others. If a person's reputation is damaged accidentally, for instance through a thoughtless remark, that does not constitute a character attack. Since character attacks are concerned with reputation, they are also by definition of a public nature. Insulting someone in private does not lead to character assassination.\n Each character attack invariably involves five aspects or pillars: the attacker, the target, the medium or media, the audience and the context. This last category can refer to the political system in which the attacks occur, the cultural environment, the level of technology, or any other factors that shape and determine character attacks.\n Many character attacks take place in the political sphere, for instance in election campaigns. However, prominent figures from other spheres can also become the targets of character attacks, such as religious leaders, scientists, athletes and movie stars.\n Moreover, character assassination appears to be a near-universal, cross-cultural phenomenon that can be found in many, if not most, countries and historical periods.\n Icks and Shiraev (2014)[4] address several political science models to explain CA reasons from the attacker's point of view. They believe that the attacker's motivation is often based on the intent to destroy the target psychologically or reduce his/her public support and/or chances to succeed in a political competition. For example, during elections, attacks are often used to sway undecided voters, create uncertainty with tentative voters, or prevent defections of supporters. These attacks therefore become an effective means of manipulating voters toward a desirable action. They also facilitate the repositioning of originally favorable supporters to the ranks of the \u201cundecided\u201d or \u201cuncommitted\u201d voters.\n Fundamentally, an attack on one's image, reputation, or brand is dependent on relevant audiences\u2019 perceptions.  For instance, studies in the field of motivated reasoning show that consumers are highly selective of what they deem is \u201cbelievable\u201d information, preferring to accept what is most congruent with existing attitudes, expectations, or actions, such as a candidate's voting record. The \u201chybrid\u201d processing model suggests that voters structure their candidate impressions or respond to candidate CA using two types of information: updated or ad-hoc.  Anxiety, or an emotional state of uncertainty and tension, can influence consumer's attitudinal shifts. \n CA should also be addressed in relation to image studies. When organizations and leaders find themselves in crises, they are particularly vulnerable to attack via scrutiny and criticism that challenge their legitimacy or social responsibility. Their reputation is then judged in the court of public opinion, which focuses on a mix of publicly positioned principles, including ethics, social and political values, or cultural or religious beliefs.  Acceptance or rejection of a candidate requires the candidate to be compatible with existing image components.  Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT)[5] is particularly applicable here in both organizational and political contexts. The theory suggests that the level of reputation threat is determined by whether the public believes the organization caused the crisis, the organization's crisis history, and the organization's prior relational reputation with the public (such as voters, stakeholders, etc.)\n Character attacks can be categorized according to various criteria. When we consider them in terms of hierarchy, we can distinguish between horizontal and vertical attacks. The former refer to a situation in which the attacker and the target have roughly the same amount of power and resources at their disposal (e.g. one presidential candidate smearing another), the latter to a situation in which there is a vast disparity in power and resources between attacker and target (e.g. political rebels smearing a dictator).\n When we consider the timing of character attacks, we can distinguish between live and post-mortem attacks, depending on whether or not the target is still alive at the time of the attack. Post-mortem attacks are often conducted to discredit the cause or ideology of the deceased. For instance, the biographies of Stalin, Reagan and Gandhi are continually scrutinized for legacy-discrediting purposes.\n During a political campaign, instantaneous or drive-by character attacks often occur. Such quick character attacks are usually opportunistic. On the other hand, the slow pace of character-poisoning is based on long-term hopes. Since the 1960s, the famous Russian author and dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn was accused of being a Jew, a traitor, a Nazi collaborator, a prison snitch, and a paid foreign intelligence agent.[6]\n According to Thomas, character assassination is an intentional attempt, usually by a narcissist and/or his or her codependents, to influence the portrayal or reputation of someone in such a way as to cause others to develop an extremely negative or unappealing perception of him or her. It typically involves deliberate exaggeration or manipulation of facts, the spreading of rumours and deliberate misinformation to present an untrue picture of the targeted person, and unwarranted and excessive criticism.[7]\n The authors of the book Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power. In phase four (confrontation), the psychopath will use techniques of character assassination to maintain their agenda.[8]\n In politics, CA is usually a part of a political \"smear campaign\" that involves intentional, premeditated efforts to undermine an individual's or group's reputation and credibility. The purpose of such campaigns is to discourage or weaken the support base of the target. Another purpose is to force the target to respond in terms of time, energy, and resources.\n CA is also a form of negative campaigning. Opposition research is the practice of collecting information on someone that can be used to discredit them. A smear campaign is the use of falsehoods or distortions. Scandalmongering can be used to associate a person with a negative event in a false or exaggerated way.\n Smears often consist of ad hominem attacks in the form of unverifiable rumors and distortions, half-truths, or even outright lies; smear campaigns are often propagated by gossip magazines and websites. Even when the facts behind smears and campaigns have been demonstrated to lack proper foundation, the tactic is often effective because the target's reputation remains tarnished regardless of the truth. Smears are also effective in diverting attention away from the matter in question. The target of the smear has to address the additional issue of correcting the false information, rather than being able to focus on their response to the original issue.\n Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign. Negative campaigning, also known more colloquially as \"mudslinging\", is trying to win an advantage by referring to negative aspects of an opponent or of a policy rather than emphasizing one's own positive attributes or preferred policies.\n Charging an opponent with character assassination may have political benefits.  In the hearings for Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, supporters claimed that both Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were victims of character assassination.[9]\n The effect of a character assassination driven by an individual is not equal to that of a state-driven campaign.\nThe state-sponsored destruction of reputations, fostered by political propaganda and cultural mechanisms, can have more far-reaching consequences. One of the earliest signs of a society's compliance to loosening the reins on the perpetration of crimes (and even massacres) with total impunity is when a government favors or directly encourages a campaign aimed at destroying the dignity and reputation of its adversaries, and the public accepts its allegations without question. The mobilisation toward ruining the reputation of adversaries is the prelude to the mobilisation of violence in order to annihilate them. Generally, official dehumanisation has preceded the physical assault of the victims.[10]\n The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination (ISSCA) specializes in the academic study and research of how character attacks and assassinations have been executed in both history and during contemporary times.[11] In July 2011, scholars from nine countries gathered at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, to debate \"the art of smear and defamation in history and today\".[12] They formed a group to study character assassination throughout the ages. The group included historians, political scientists, and political psychologists.[13]\n Founded in 2016 in cooperation with the ISSCA, the CARP Lab includes scholars with disciplinary homes in psychology, history, communication and public relations.[14] With investigators from George Mason University, the University of Baltimore, and the University of Amsterdam, the CARP team focuses efforts along three main dimensions: research on historical and contemporary examples of character assassination; education for academic and public audiences about character assassination causes, impacts and prevention; and risk assessment to determine vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies for public figures concerned about their reputations. The Mason CARP website features materials about the lab and its activities. The CARP Lab additionally publishes a blog[15] and is affiliated[16] with the Global Informality Project, a leading online resource for the world's open secrets, unwritten rules and hidden practices, broadly defined as 'ways of getting things done.'[17] This global and growing collection of invisible, yet powerful informal practices is made possible by remarkable collaboration of scholars from five continents.\n In 2017 and 2019, CARP hosted two international conferences that welcomed numerous U.S. and international researchers and academics studying different aspects of CA. The proceedings and report of the CARP 2017 conference 'Character Assassination in Theory and Practice' can be found on the Mason website.[18][19]\n The CARP 2019 conference 'Character Assassination and Populism: Challenges and Responses' featured critical input from practitioners in crisis management, journalism, and public relations. The event attracted scholars from twenty countries around the world.[20]\n In 2019, the CARP Lab published its first handbook titled \"Routledge Handbook of Character Assassination and Reputation Management\".[21]\n", " Michel Dubois (born November 7, 1954) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the World Hockey Association (WHA).[1] Dubois played parts of two WHA seasons with the Indianapolis Racers and Quebec Nordiques.[1] He was drafted in the twelfth round of the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft by the Chicago Cougars.[2]\n \n", " \n The Taiwan yuhina (Yuhina brunneiceps), also known as Formosan yuhina, is a small songbird endemic to the island of Taiwan.[1][2]\n Like other yuhinas, it is closely related to the white-eyes and if these were considered a distinct family Zosteropidae, it would be placed there. Otherwise, it would belong together with the white-eyes into the Old World babbler family Timaliidae.[3] The closest living relative of this species appears to be the black-chinned yuhina, which occurs on the Asian mainland.[4]\n The Taiwan yuhina is 12\u201313\u00a0cm (4.7\u20135.1\u00a0in) in length with a chocolate brown crest and a black beard stripe descending from its beak. The bird's back, wings and tail are dark ash brown, and its lower breast is lighter in colour.[2] Agreeing with other typical yuhinas in habitus, its colouration pattern is rather uncommon among the genus.[4]\n This species is found in hill forests at elevations of 1,000\u20133,200\u00a0m (3,300\u201310,500\u00a0ft) above sea level, although it is the most common between 1,500\u20132,500\u00a0m (4,900\u20138,200\u00a0ft); it can descent to low altitudes in winter.[2] It is gregarious, active and quite tame. It keeps to lower forest and often joins other species, especially tits in mixed flocks. The flocks, while feeding, make a constant soft chatter. The call of the Taiwan yuhina is a sound somewhat like twi-MI-chiu, which resembles the phrase \"We MEET you\". The yuhina's diet consists of mainly nectar, berries, flowers and small insects. Taiwan yuhina may sometimes be observed hanging upside down on cherry trees. These songbirds are particularly fond of the flowers of the Chinese tulip tree and the fruits of trees of the family Elaeagnaceae and the genus Idesia (Salicaceae).\n Based on a population in Nantou County, diet during the breeding season mostly consists of nectar and fruits of Taiwan cherry (Prunus campanulata), fruits of eastern debregeasia (Debregeasia orientalis), and nectar of mistletoe Taxillus lonicerifolius.[5]\n Breeding season for the Taiwan yuhina is from May to June.\n", " SVISTA (Serenity Virtual Station) is a former commercial virtual machine software product marketed by Serenity Systems International. Windows, OS/2, Linux and FreeBSD hosted versions were available.[1]\n This product is no longer available nor supported.\n SVISTA was developed under contract with Parallels Software Studio and was based on its existing TwoOStwo software, although the OS/2 and FreeBSD hosted versions were specific to SVISTA.\n Providing a virtualization product was initially part of Serenity's strategy for marketing its eComStation operating system.  When the OS/2 port of Connectix VirtualPC was discontinued following the acquisition of its creator by Microsoft, Serenity contracted Parallels to develop SVISTA as an alternative. A beta program was launched in the spring of 2004,[1] with a general availability release in October of that year.[2]\n However, the product was discontinued shortly afterwards following the acquisition of Parallels by SWsoft.  According to Bob St. John of Serenity Systems, SWsoft was not interested in continuing the development of SVISTA, and withdrew from the OEM contract.[3]\n Although Serenity briefly expressed interest in finding another solution for an OS/2 hosted virtualization product, it was eventually deemed impractical due to increased competition in the consumer market from Microsoft and VMware.[4]\n The former product website currently indicates that SVISTA is no longer available, and suggests Virtual Bridges and VirtualBox as possible third-party alternatives.\n When using SVISTA instances in an environment where MAC addresses are used as unique identifiers (UID), it is advisable to manually configure the MAC address for each virtual machine to ensure each is actually unique. One example of such an environment is one in which MAC security is enabled on switches and another example is an environment in which Altiris products are used (if configured to use the MAC address as the UID). If you are in such a situation, simply disable all networks/adapters other than bridged and edit each virtual machine's configuration (.2os) file and change the 'MAC address' to be unique.\n The first and only GA release was SVISTA 2004, released on October 14, 2004.  The final release was SVISTA Feature Release 1, beta 3, which was made available to registered customers in May 2005.\n", " Thomas Gregory Michael Hnatiw (pronounced \"Na-chew\"; born December 13, 1958, died 30 July 2012 in Oakville, Ontario, Canada) was a Canadian motor journalist and live motor race announcer.\n Tom Hnatiw was best known as co-presenter of the TV show Dream Car Garage on Speed Channel alongside Peter Klutt from 2000 to 2008. There he was famous for the phrase \"Do you need a car like this? No. Do you want a car like this???\" Further he was involved with the programmes Hard Drive and Sports Car Revolution. He was the founder and owner of the Internal Combustion Group, a television production company based around automotive programming. Altogether he was involved in the production of over 500 shows related to the automotive world and co-owner of a 5000 square-foot race shop.\n He wrote several widely read automotive columns and was featured in newspapers such as the Toronto Star.\n He also was a well known live race announcer, e.g., for the SRT Viper Cup series of the North American Road Racing Association, for which he also was a spokesperson. Hnatiw himself, raced for 15 years and was Canadian GT3 co-champion in 1998.\n On 30 July 2012 he died in a hospital in Oakville, Ontario from kidney failure, aged 53. He left behind his wife of 23 years Debbie and his two sons Nick and Wyatt. \"His genuine passion for racing, concern for the well-being of drivers, and the way he made every competitor feel as welcome,\" said  NARRA President Tom Antonelli in a farewell note. \"His beaming smile, and that unmistakable voice, will be truly missed.\"\n", " The Taipingwan Dam (T'aep'y\u014fngman Dam) is a gravity dam on the lower Yalu River between China and North Korea. It is located about 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) northeast of Dandong, Liaoning Province and Sinuiju, North Pyongan Province. The dam was first designed in 1978 and construction began in October 1982. The river was diverted in September 1983 and the first generator was operational on 25 December 1986. The three remaining generators were commissioned in 1987, and the dam was complete in July of that year.[1] China built the dam and operates its 190 MW power station. Power from the dam is used by both China and North Korea.[2]\n", " The following is a list of state highways in the U.S. state of Louisiana designated in the 650\u2013699 range.\n  Louisiana Highway 650 (LA 650) ran 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) in a southeast to northwest direction between Gray and Schriever, Terrebonne Parish.[1]\n From the southeast, LA 650 began at an intersection with LA 316 (Bayou Blue Road) at a point just east of Gray.  It proceeded in a northerly direction along Bayou Blue Bypass Road.  LA 650 briefly jogged to the east then back to the north, separating from Bayou Blue Bypass Road.  It continued north along the Terrebonne \u2013 Lafourche Parish line to Martinez Road.  Here it turned west onto Waterplant Road, skirting the southern boundary of Schriever.  LA 650 entered Schriever then made a jog to the north and back to the west, proceeding to its terminus at LA 24.\n LA 650 was an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.\n The entire highway was in Terrebonne Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 651 (LA 651) ran 1.3 miles (2.1\u00a0km) in a north\u2013south direction along Bowie Road in Raceland, Lafourche Parish.\n The route began at LA 308, which runs along Bayou Lafourche, and proceeded to a point on the Texas & New Orleans Railroad line (now the BNSF/Union Pacific Railroad) where the community of Bowie was once located.  It was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.  Now a ghost town, Bowie once thrived around a lumber mill served by the rail line north of Raceland in the early 20th Century.[2]\n In the pre-1955 state highway system, LA 651 was designated as State Route 891.[3]  LA 651 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering[4] and deleted from the state highway system in 1975.\n The entire highway was in Lafourche Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 652 (LA 652) runs 3.72 miles (5.99\u00a0km) in a north\u2013south direction from a dead end at Bayou Cut Off to LA 182 in Raceland, Lafourche Parish.[6]\n The route initially heads west from a boat launch on Bayou Cut Off then turns north and crosses US 90 via an overpass.  The freeway is accessed indirectly by the north service road.  LA 652 zigzags west, then northwest along Bayou Folse, north across Bayou Cutoff, and finally northwest a short distance to an intersection with LA 182 just inside Raceland.  LA 652 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.[6][7][8]\n The entire highway is in Lafourche Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 653 (LA 653) runs 2.58 miles (4.15\u00a0km) in a north\u2013south direction from a local road south of Bayou Du Mar to LA 182 south of Raceland, Lafourche Parish.[9]\n The route heads north from an intersection with Eagle Island Road, a local road, and crosses Bayou Du Mar.  It then crosses US 90 via an overpass.  The freeway is accessed indirectly by the north service road.  LA 653 continues north to an intersection with LA 182 south of Raceland.  It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.[7][8][9]\n Until recently, LA 653 extended west from its current southern terminus along what is now a private road to a second intersection with LA 182, existing as a loop off of that highway.  In this form, LA 653 was part of the original route of the Old Spanish Trail, designated as State Route 2 in 1921 (in the pre-1955 Louisiana Highway system) and US 90 in 1926.  This route was bypassed in 1938 when US 90 was moved onto what is now LA 182.  LA 182 was then bypassed by the current route of US 90 in 1977 (north of Exit 210) and in 1999 (south of Exit 210).\n The entire route is in Lafourche Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 654 (LA 654) runs 5.51 miles (8.87\u00a0km) in an east\u2013west direction from LA 1 in Mathews to the Company Canal bridge northwest of Gheens, Lafourche Parish.[10]\n The route heads northeast from LA 1 and immediately crosses a vertical lift bridge over Bayou Lafourche.  It then intersects LA 308 which, like LA 1, follows alongside the bayou.  4.4 miles (7.1\u00a0km) later, LA 654 curves to the south and proceeds a short distance to a bridge at the Company Canal.  A private road crosses the canal and proceeds toward the Golden Ranch Plantation in Gheens.  LA 654 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.[7][8][10][11]\n The entire highway is in Lafourche Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 655 (LA\u00a0655) runs 0.62 miles (1.00\u00a0km) in an east\u2013west direction from a local road in Lockport to LA\u00a0308 in Rita, Lafourche Parish.[13]\n The route begins at the intersection of Main and Vacherie Streets in Lockport.  It immediately crosses a swing bridge across Bayou Lafourche into the unincorporated community of Rita.  It then turns east and follows East Main Street to a junction with LA\u00a0308, the primary highway along the east bank of the bayou.  LA\u00a0655 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.  A spur, 0.44 miles (0.71\u00a0km) in length and signed as the mainline route, follows Vacherie Street in Lockport from the bridge to LA\u00a01 (Crescent Avenue).[7][13]\n LA\u00a0655 was formerly a loop that encompassed Main Street in Lockport, connecting with LA\u00a01 on the east side of Lockport.  The route also had a spur, signed as the mainline route, that consisted of an alternate connection to LA\u00a01 along Vacherie Street in Lockport.  This mileage was all transferred to local control in 2019 as part of La\u00a0DOTD's Road Transfer Program.[14]\n The entire highway is in Lafourche Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 656 (LA 656) ran 1.5 miles (2.4\u00a0km) in a west\u2013east direction along Lake Long Drive near the Lafourche\u2013Terrebonne Parish line northeast of Houma.[15]\n The route proceeded eastward from an intersection with LA 316 (Bayou Blue Road) along the remains of Lake Long Bayou to a dead end west of the Company Canal and Lake Long.  It was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.[15]\n In the pre-1955 state highway system, LA 656 was designated as State Route C-1798.[3]  LA 656 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering[4] and deleted in 1993.\n The entire highway was in Lafourche Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 657 (LA 657) runs 2.51 miles (4.04\u00a0km) in a north\u2013south direction from LA 3235 in Larose to the end of state maintenance just north of Larose in Lafourche Parish.[16]\n The route heads northeast from LA 3235 and intersects LA 1, which follows the west bank of Bayou Lafourche.  It proceeds immediately across a vertical lift bridge over the bayou and intersects LA 308.  Here, LA 657 turns west alongside Bayou Lafourche while LA 308 continues straight ahead.  Reaching the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, LA 657 turns again to the northeast and crosses underneath LA 308.  State maintenance ends just beyond Pump Station 7 Road, a local road.  LA 657 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.[8][11][16]\n The entire highway is in Lafourche Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 658 (LA 658) ran 0.69 miles (1.11\u00a0km) in a west\u2013east direction between two points along LA 20 in Schriever, Terrebonne Parish.\n The route proceeded north from LA 20 along North Main Project Road (Parish Road 29), immediately crossing the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks (now the BNSF/Union Pacific Railroad).  LA 658 then turned east onto Broadway Avenue, running parallel with the rail line, and continued to a point on the bypassed portion of LA 20 now known as Old Schriever Highway.  It was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.\n In the pre-1955 state highway system, LA 658 was designated as State Route C-1982.[17]  LA 658 was created with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering[4] and deleted in 1973.  LA 20 had been realigned onto a new railroad overpass about five years earlier, eliminating the at-grade crossing with the rail line and the direct connection between the two highways.[18][19]\n The entire highway was in Schriever, Terrebonne Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 659 (LA 659) runs 4.42 miles (7.11\u00a0km) in an east\u2013west direction from LA 24 in Houma to a second junction with LA 24 at Presquille, Terrebonne Parish.[20]\n The route heads east from LA 24, which changes from a divided four-lane highway flanking Bayou Terrebonne to an undivided two-lane highway running along the west bank of the bayou.  LA 659 proceeds along the east bank and exits the city of Houma.  After curving to the southeast, it intersects LA 3087 (Prospect Boulevard).  The highway continues southeast to Presquille and a second intersection with LA 24, which crosses to the east bank of the bayou.  LA 659 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.[8][20][21]\n The entire highway is in Terrebonne Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 660 (LA 660) runs 8.32 miles (13.39\u00a0km) in an east\u2013west direction along Coteau Road from LA 24 in Gray to LA 316 northeast of Houma, Terrebonne Parish.[22]\n The route heads northeast from LA 24, which travels on either side of Bayou Terrebonne.  It then curves to the southeast, running parallel to the limits of Bayou Cane and Houma.  LA 660 intersects LA 182 and LA 3087, which connect Houma to eastbound US 90.  The route ends at an intersection with LA 316 on the Terrebonne\u2013Lafourche parish line.  It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.[8][21][22]\n \n  Louisiana Highway 661 (LA 661) runs 2.61 miles (4.20\u00a0km) in a north\u2013south direction from LA 315 south of Houma to LA 24 in Houma, Terrebonne Parish.[23]\n The route heads northeast from an interchange with LA 315 (Bayou Dularge Road) and immediately crosses a swing bridge over the Houma Navigation Canal.  It then crosses a vertical lift bridge over Bayou La Carpe and enters the city of Houma where it travels along South Van Avenue.  In Houma, LA 661 intersects LA 57 (Grand Caillou Road) and LA 3040 (Tunnel Boulevard).  Crossing LA 3040, the highway curves to the north as Howard Avenue and proceeds to LA 24 (Main Street) at Bayou Terrebonne.  A locally maintained vertical lift bridge crosses the bayou and connects to LA 659 (Park Avenue), which follows the opposite bank.  LA 661 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length.[8][21][23]\n The entire highway is in Terrebonne Parish.\n  Louisiana Highway 662 (LA 662) runs 11.2 miles (18.0\u00a0km) in a long loop off of US 90 and its former alignment, LA 182, with the western end extending down to the Intracoastal Waterway south of Boeuf.[24]\n LA 662 heads north on Oilfield Road through Boeuf and crosses underneath the Bayou Boeuf bridge on US 90 Bus./LA 182.  It immediately turns east, briefly running alongside US 90 Bus./LA 182 before resuming its northern course, now in a concurrency with US 90 Bus.  (LA 182 continues eastward into Terrebonne Parish alone.)  The concurrency ends at an interchange with Exit 182 on US 90, after which LA 662 proceeds north then curves northeast to Bayou L'Ourse, intersecting LA 663 and LA 398.  The latter heads north to Labadieville, connecting LA 662 with the rest of Assumption Parish.  LA 662 then curves back to the southeast, passing through a second interchange with US 90 at Exit 185 and terminating at LA 182 in an area known as Zacarter.\n LA 662 is generally an undivided two-lane highway but widens to a divided four-lane highway in the vicinity of the two interchanges with US 90.\n \n  Louisiana Highway 664 (LA 664) runs 0.82 miles (1.32\u00a0km) in a north\u2013south direction along St. Charles Street in Houma, Terrebonne Parish.[25]\n The route begins at LA 311 (Little Bayou Black Drive) and proceeds north along the Houma\u2013Bayou Cane line.  Almost midway through its route, LA 664 intersects LA 3040 (Tunnel Boulevard), a four-lane highway that runs southeast to northwest through Houma and Bayou Cane.  At the end of its route, LA 664 intersects eastbound LA 24 (Main Street), crosses a bridge over Bayou Terrebonne, and terminates at westbound LA 24 (Park Avenue).

This region is noted for its sweet wines[1] made from grapes affected by noble rot, a style of wine which has a long history in this region. The \"nectar\" coming from the grapes of Tokaj is also mentioned in the national anthem of Hungary.\n The Slovak wine region of Tokaj may use the Tokajsk\u00fd/-\u00e1/-\u00e9 label (\"of Tokaj\" in Slovak)[2] if they apply the Hungarian quality control regulation.[2] This area used to be part of the greater Tokaj-Hegyalja region within the Kingdom of Hungary, but was divided between Hungary and Czechoslovakia after the Treaty of Trianon.\n Six grape varieties are officially approved for Tokaji wine production:\n Furmint accounts for 60% of the area and is by far the most important grape in the production of Asz\u00fa wines. H\u00e1rslevel\u0171 stands for further 30%. Nevertheless, an impressive range of different types and styles of wines are produced in the region, ranging from dry whites to the Eszencia, the world's sweetest wine.[3]\n The area where Tokaji wine is traditionally grown is a small plateau, 457 metres (1,500\u00a0ft) above sea level, near the Carpathian Mountains. The soil is of volcanic origin, with high concentrations of iron and lime. The location of the region has a unique climate, beneficial to this particular viniculture, due to the protection of the nearby mountains. Winters are bitterly cold and windy; spring tends to be cool and dry, and summers are noticeably hot. Usually, autumn brings rain early on, followed by an extended Indian summer, allowing a very long ripening period.\n The Furmint grapes begin maturation with thick skins, but as they ripen the skins become thinner, and transparent. This allows the sun to penetrate the grape and evaporate much of the liquid inside, producing a higher concentration of sugar. Other types of grapes mature to the point of bursting, however, unlike most other grapes, Furmint will grow a second skin which seals it from rot. This also has the effect of concentrating the grape's natural sugars. The grapes are left on the vine long enough to develop the \"noble rot\" (Botrytis cinerea) mold. Grapes then are harvested, sometimes as late as December (and in the case of true Eszencia, occasionally into January).[4]\n Typical yearly production in the region runs to a relatively small 100,280 hectolitres (2,649,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal).[citation needed]\n These wines, once referred to as common, ordin\u00e1rium, are now named after their respective grape varieties: Tokaji Furmint, Tokaji H\u00e1rslevel\u0171, Tokaji S\u00e1rgamuskot\u00e1ly and Tokaji K\u00f6v\u00e9rsz\u0151l\u0151.\n In 1999, Chateau Pajzos became the first winery to produce a Tokaji ice wine.\n Prior to 1918 (the end of World War I and the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), the finest eszencia Tokaji was not sold but was reserved for the Imperial cellars of the Habsburg Monarchy.[8] By the mid 18th century these finest eszencia Tokaji originally held by the Habsburgs were called \"Imperial Tokay\". Cases, barrels, and bottles of it often passed between European monarchs as gifts. In 2008, a bottle of Imperial Tokay bearing the seal of the wine cellar of the Royal Saxon Court sold at auction at Christie's for \u00a31,955.[9]\n It is not known for how long vines have been grown on the volcanic soil of the fork of the rivers Bodrog and Hern\u00e1d. This predates the settlement of the Magyar tribes to the region.[6] According to legend, the first asz\u00fa was made by Laczk\u00f3 M\u00e1t\u00e9 Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from asz\u00fa grapes had already appeared in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Bal\u00e1zs Sziksai which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of asz\u00fa predates this reference by five years.\n Tokaji wine became the subject of the world's first appellation control, established several decades before Port wine, and over 120 years before the classification of Bordeaux. Vineyard classification began in 1730 with vineyards being classified into three categories depending on the soil, sun exposure and potential to develop noble rot, botrytis cinerea, first class, second class and third class wines. A royal decree in 1757 established a closed production district in Tokaj. The classification system was completed by the national censuses of 1765 and 1772.\n In 1920, following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a small part of the Tokaj wine region (approx. 1.75\u00a0km\u00b2) became part of Czechoslovakia due to the Treaty of Trianon, while the rest remained part of Hungary. After World War II, when Hungary became a Soviet-influenced state, Tokaji production continued with as many as 6,000 small producers, but the bottling and distribution were monopolized by the state-owned organization.\nSince the collapse of the communist regimes in 1990, a number of independent wineries have been established in the Tokaj wine region. A state-owned producer continues to exist and handles approximately 20% of the overall production.\n Voivode Stephen the Great of Moldavia was said to be a very big fan of Tokay wines. He introduced in Moldavia the K\u00f6v\u00e9rsz\u0151l\u0151 cultivar, that lead to the development of Gras\u0103 de Cotnari wine.[10]\n Tokaji has since the 18th century been known as \"Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum\" (\"Wine of Kings, King of Wines\"),[11] an epithet sometimes attributed to King Louis XIV of France. In 1703, Francis R\u00e1k\u00f3czi II, Prince of Transylvania, gave Louis XIV some Tokaji wine from his Tokaj estate as a gift. The Tokaji wine was served at the French Royal court at Versailles, where it became known as Tokay.\n Emperor Franz Josef (who was also King of Hungary) had a tradition of sending Queen Victoria Tokaji Asz\u00fa wine, as a gift, every year on her birthday, one bottle for every month she had lived, twelve for each year. On her eighty-first and final birthday (1900), this totaled an impressive 972 bottles.\n Tokaji wine has received accolades from numerous great writers and composers including Beethoven, Liszt, Schubert, Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich von Schiller, Bram Stoker, Johann Strauss II, and Voltaire.\nThe composer Joseph Haydn's favorite wine was Tokaji. Besides Louis XIV, several other European monarchs are known to have been keen consumers of the wine. Louis XV and Frederick the Great tried to outdo one another when they treated guests such as Voltaire with Tokaji. Napoleon III, the last Emperor of the French, ordered 30\u201340 barrels of Tokaji at the French Royal Court every year. Pope Pius IV. (1499\u20131565) at the Council of Trient in 1562, exclaimed: Summum pontificem talia vina decent! (This is the type of wine that should be on the papal table). Gustav III, King of Sweden, loved Tokaji \u2013 it has been said he never had any other wine to drink. In Russia, customers included Peter the Great and Empress Elizabeth of Russia. A newspaper account of the 1933 wedding of Polish president Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki notes that toasts were made with 250-year-old wines, and goes on to say \"The wine, if good, could only have been Essence of Tokay, and the centuries-old friendship between Poland and Hungary would seem to support this conclusion.\"[12]\n Tokaji wines have been famous for a long time, which has resulted in their name being \u201cadopted\u201d by other wines:\n", " \n Frank Hornby (15 May 1863\u00a0\u2013 21 September 1936) was an English inventor, businessman and politician. He was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, and although he had no formal engineering training, he was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys. He also founded the British toy company Meccano Ltd in 1908, and launched a monthly publication, Meccano Magazine in 1916.\n Hornby's inventions and initiatives made him a millionaire in the 1930s, and he entered politics in 1931 when he was elected as a Conservative MP for the Everton constituency. Hornby's legacy has persisted long after his death with enthusiasts all over the world still building Meccano models and collecting his toys. The 150th anniversary of Hornby's birth was celebrated in Liverpool and Brighton on 15 May 2013.\n Born on 15 May 1863 at 77 Copperas Hill, Liverpool, Lancashire, Hornby was the son of John Oswald Hornby, a provision merchant and his wife Martha Hornby (n\u00e9e Thomlinson), though this date has been questioned. It is the date on his birth certificate, but the entry in the family bible in his mother's handwriting gives the date as 2 May.[1] At the age of sixteen, Hornby left school and started working as a cashier in his father's business. On 15 January 1887 he married a schoolteacher Clara Walker Godefroy, the daughter of a customs officer and they had two sons, Roland and Douglas, and a daughter, Patricia. When his father died in 1899, his father's business was closed and Hornby became a bookkeeper for David Hugh Elliot who ran a meat importing business in Liverpool.\n After experimenting with new ideas in his home workshop, Hornby began making toys for his sons in 1899 with pieces he cut from sheet metal. He built models of bridges, trucks and cranes, although the pieces they were made from were not interchangeable. The breakthrough came when Hornby realised that if he could make separate, interchangeable parts that could be bolted together, any model could be built from the same components. The key inventive step was the realisation that regular perforations in the structural pieces could be used, not only to join them together with nuts and bolts, but also to journal\u00a0\u2013 act as a bearing for\u00a0\u2013 axles and shafts. This made the construction of complex mechanisms relatively simple. He started making metal strips by hand from copper sheets. The strips were half an inch wide with holes for bolts spaced at half inch intervals. Initially he made the nuts and bolts himself, but he soon found an alternate source of supply.\n By the end of 1900 Hornby had built a set of parts he considered worth marketing. On advice, he patented his invention in January 1901 as \"Improvements in Toy or Educational Devices for Children and Young People\", but not without first having to borrow \u00a35 from his employer, David Elliot, to cover the costs.\n During 1901 Hornby began looking for companies to manufacture his product, but it was poorly finished and did not attract much attention. Still having to support his family on the small wage he earned, Hornby did not have much time to market his invention. Fortunately, his employer saw potential in what Hornby was doing and offered him some vacant premises next to the office where he worked to pursue his ideas. With this move, Elliot and Hornby became partners.\n Hornby now called his construction toy \"Mechanics Made Easy\" and after receiving a positive endorsement from professor Henry Selby Hele-Shaw, then Head of the Engineering Department at Liverpool University, Hornby managed to secure contracts with outside manufacturers to supply the parts for his construction sets. With the financial assistance of his partner, \"Mechanics Made Easy\" sets went on sale in 1902.\n Each set had only 16 different parts with a leaflet detailing the construction of 12 models. In 1903, 1,500 sets were sold, although no profit was made. New parts were continually being introduced and in 1904, six sets, packed in tin boxes with instruction manuals in French and English, became available. In 1905 two new sets were introduced and in 1906, for the first time, a small profit was made.\n By 1907 Hornby's part suppliers could not meet the demand. This prompted Hornby to quit his job with Elliot and find suitable premises to begin manufacturing his own parts. He secured a three-year lease on a workshop in Duke Street, by Dukes Terrace in the Rope Walks area of Liverpool, and with the help of a loan granted to Hornby and Elliot for machinery and wages, they were manufacturing their own parts by June 1907.\n In September 1907, Hornby registered his famous \"Meccano\" trade mark and used this name on all new sets. In order to raise more capital to invest in a larger factory and plant, a company had to be created. This led to the formation of Meccano Ltd on 30 May 1908. Elliot had decided not to join the new company, leaving Hornby as the sole proprietor. The Meccano factory was relocated to West Derby Road in Liverpool, and in 1910 the famous \"MECCANO\" logo was commissioned. Meccano Ltd's turnover for the 1910 financial year was \u00a312,000.\n Meccano was exported to many countries and in 1912, Hornby and his son, Roland, formed Meccano (France) Ltd in Paris to manufacture Meccano. An office was also opened in Berlin, Germany and M\u00e4rklin began to manufacture Meccano under licence. Hornby also started importing clockwork motors from M\u00e4rklin.\n In order to keep pace with demand, a new factory was built in Binns Road, Liverpool. By September 1914 the Binns Road Factory was in full production and became the company headquarters for over 60 years.\n In addition to Meccano, Hornby developed and manufactured a number of other model kits and toys, including:\n In 1916, Hornby launched a monthly publication, Meccano Magazine, which remained in circulation for over sixty years, and in 1930 he formed the Meccano Guild, an amalgamation of Meccano clubs from all over the world.\n By the 1930s, Hornby had become a millionaire. He owned a mansion Quarry Brook in Maghull (his first house in Maghull was the Hollies in Station Road), and was chauffeured to Binns Road every day by limousine. In 1931 he entered politics when he was elected as a Conservative MP for the Everton constituency. He left the running of the company to his co-Directors and staff. But he did not stay in politics long\u00a0\u2013 he resigned his parliamentary seat before the 1935 General Election.\n Hornby died of a chronic heart condition complicated by diabetes in Maghull, near Liverpool, Lancashire,on 21 September 1936. He is buried in the grounds of St Andrew's Church, Maghull. His elder son Roland took over as Chairman of Meccano Ltd.\n Hornby's legacy lives on today with thousands of enthusiasts all over the world still building Meccano models, running Hornby Train sets and collecting Dinky Toys. In his homeplace of Maghull there is a local Wetherspoons pub named after him, The Frank Hornby.\n The 150th anniversary of Frank Hornby's birth fell on 15 May 2013,[2] and festivities were held by the National Museums Liverpool and the Frank Hornby Charitable Trust, Maghull, and by the Brighton Toy and Model Museum.[3][4][5]\n Google also celebrated the 150th Anniversary with a Google Doodle on their UK homepage on 15 May 2013.[6][7]\n", " The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gatineau (Latin: Archidioecesis Gatinensis) is situated in the province of Quebec. Its ecclesiastical province includes the suffragan dioceses of Amos, Mont-Laurier and Rouyn-Noranda.

The division was created in the United Kingdom on 17 June 1941 during World War II from elements of the Guards units, the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards. and Welsh Guards.\n The division remained in the United Kingdom, training, until 13 June 1944, when it landed several armoured command vehicles  at Arromanches and lagered its advanced tactical headquarters in communication with GHQ awaiting the bulk of the armour Normandy, France, during Operation Overlord as part of VIII Corps where its first major engagement was Operation Goodwood, the attack by three armoured divisions towards Bourguebus Ridge in an attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead. That was followed by Operation Bluecoat, the advance east of Caen as the Falaise pocket formed. Transferred to XXX Corps, the division liberated Brussels. It led the XXX Corps attack in Operation Market Garden, the ground forces' advance to relieve airborne troops aiming to seize the bridges up to Arnhem, capturing Nijmegen bridge in conjunction with American paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division. The Tac HQ reached Arnhem but was not able to seize the bridge because German anti tank guns were entrenched on the North side and the British airborne had surrendered or were too far away to help. During the Ardennes offensive, it was sent in bitterly cold weather, which forced the tanks to start their engines every hour to prevent the fuel and oil freezing, to the Meuse as a reserve in case the Germans broke through the American lines; some German tanks breaking through were stopped. It endured hard fighting in Operation Veritable, the advance towards the Rhine through the Reichswald, and again in the advance through Germany. The division existed until 12 June 1945, more than two months after Victory in Europe Day, when it was reorganised as an infantry division, the Guards Division, after almost exactly four years as an armoured division.\n Brainchild of General Sir Alan Brooke, Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, the Guards Armoured Division, commanded by Major General Oliver Leese, was formed in May 1941 as a result of the shortage of armoured troops in England to face a German invasion. There was opposition to this move, as it was felt by the establishment that the height of the Guards\u2014selected for height, amongst other criteria, as elite soldiers\u2014would make them poor tank crew. The division originally consisted of two armoured brigades, the 5th and the 6th. These consisted of three tank regiments of Covenanter V tanks and a motor infantry battalion. A certain level of common sense was applied to these changes, with the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards being assigned as the motor battalion, due to the presence of King's Company. This group of men were all at least 6 feet tall and were expected to struggle to fit into tanks. Uniquely the Guards Armoured Division also kept its infantry company structure, with the tanks organised into companies and battalions, rather than squadrons and regiments.[6]\n At the end of 1942, the division, now under the command of Major General Allan Adair, was split in line with all armoured divisions at this time, with one armoured brigade replaced with a brigade of lorried infantry. At this point the 6th and 5th Guards Armoured Brigades were separated. During this period the division re-equipped with Crusader III tanks, which were again replaced with Sherman Vs by 1944.\n The Guards Armoured Division landed in Normandy at the end of June, and went into battle around Carpiquet Airfield soon after, with the infantry of the 32nd Guards Brigade skirmishing with the 12th SS Hitlerjugend. However this was only to last a couple of weeks before the armour arrived and the division was deployed further south to participate in Operation Goodwood.\n The aim of this attack has been debated many times, but whether an attempt at a breakout or a more limited effort, it had the effect of drawing most of the German reserves towards Caen, aiding the Cobra offensive. Originally intended as a combined attack, it was changed to an armoured assault as the British Army in France had suffered heavy infantry casualties and were struggling to find replacements. As a result, the attack was changed to one largely of armoured divisions, as lost tanks would be easier to replace.\n The Guards Armoured Division joined with the 7th and 11th Armoured Divisions for this attack. The aim was to strike south out of the Orne bridgehead on 18 July. The Guards Armoured Division was to advance south-east to capture Vimont and Argences. Prior to this attack the German defences were heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force. Unfortunately this was less effective than hoped against the dug-in defenders, both in the south of Caen and in Cagny and Emieville. All three of these areas were in the path of the Guards advance. The attack quickly bogged down and losses became heavy, the guards losing 60 tanks to a single battery of four Luftwaffe 88mm AA guns. In addition to this, a group of Tiger I tanks of the 503, which had been completely knocked out in the bombardment, recovered enough over the course of the morning to stiffen the resistance against the Guards. In addition, the Guards were checked by a Schwere Panzerabteilung and a counterattack by the 12 SS Hilterjugend. Novel tactics had to be employed to deal with the more heavily gunned and armoured Tiger, with one being rammed by a Sherman of the Irish Guards.\n Whilst taking part in Operation Goodwood east of Cagny, Lt John Gorman who was a Troop Commander in the 2nd Armoured Battalion was probing forward in his Sherman tank Ballyragget when suddenly he found himself broadside to a German Tiger II, the German heavy tank that no-one had yet seen. He fired his 75mm gun but the shot bounced off German tank. He was unable to fire again as the Sherman's gun was jammed. By now, the Tiger Tank was traversing its gun towards Gorman's Sherman so he ordered his driver L/Cpl James Brown to ram the German Tank. The collision disabled the Tiger and caused its crew to bail out. After seeing his own crew to safety, Lt Gorman commandeered a Firefly, Ballymena, whose commander had been killed and continued to fire at the Tiger tank with the Firefly's 17-pounder gun until the Tiger's destruction was complete. For this action Lt John Gorman was awarded the Military Cross and his driver L/Cpl James Brown was awarded the Military Medal, being the first of the Allied Expeditionary Forces to knock out a Tiger II.[7]. However, the German account is rather different. The Tiger II gunner, Hans-Joachim Thaysen, insisted he never even saw Gorman's Sherman and was instead concentrating on firing ahead of him. Thaysen also said that it was a German anti tank gun friendly fire incident which was likely trying to fire at Gorman's Sherman that destroyed his Tiger II,  which caused the crew to bail out. The 75mm PaK hit the Tiger II on the left side between the track and running gear. Thaysen said the round penetrated and just missed him under his backside. \n The next day enough progress was made to allow the Guards to reach Bourgebus Ridge and support the 7th and 11th Armoured Divisions, however German reinforcements started to arrive and the attack ground to a halt. Fighting continued until 20 July, when the gains were consolidated by infantry and the attack died off. The battle, while not a success from the operational point of view, was a battle in which the Guards acquitted themselves satisfactorily. The operation also drew off most of the German mechanised reserves, being convinced that the allies planned to breakout from Caen. This left little for reinforcements, when the Americans unleashed Operation Cobra on 25 July.\n After Goodwood the Guards Armoured Division was reorganized into unofficial battlegroups. Goodwood had shown the undesirable effects of not having supporting infantry with the tanks. Consequently, the two Grenadier battalions were formed into a battlegroup, with the Coldstream infantry attached to the Irish Guards Tanks and the Coldstream Guards tanks split into two groups and used to support the Irish and Welsh Guards battalions. The units were not organized in any formal way at this point, but rather by who happened to be closest at the time. This organisation was not unique to the Guards, the 11th Armoured also adapted the formation for Bluecoat, apparently on Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor's orders. After this reorganisation, the Guards Armoured Division took part in Operation Bluecoat.[8]\n Operation Bluecoat was launched on 30 July in support of the Americans taking part in Operation Cobra. Rather than continue to try to push past Caen where the majority of the German armour had redeployed after Goodwood, this attack switched back towards Villers-Bocage to support the Americans and to capture the road junction at Vire and the high ground at Mont Pincon. While the opposition was initially two weak infantry divisions (326th and 276th), they were well dug in, having prepared minefield and other defences. The terrain was bocage which also slowed down the speed of the attack. Initially the Guards supported the 11th Armoured Division who were the spearhead of the attack by protecting their flank, however they took over the spearhead duties themselves on 1 August, fighting in the bocage until 15 August against elements of the 326th and 276th Infantry, 21st Panzer and 1st, 9th and 10th SS-Panzer Divisions. This was to prove challenging to the Guards who complained that they \"had been brought up indirect shooting at two miles, none of this fifteen yard business\". The Germans ended up committing their tanks piecemeal, and as a result there was no defensive line as such. Instead common opposition would consist of a small mobile group of infantry supported by a few tanks or self-propelled guns. Snipers and mortars were a particular problem in this terrain, with field modifications added to the tank to try to reduce the damage. Due to the difficulty of completely clearing the enemy from a particular area and of supplying sub-units, the attack ground to a halt on 4 August. On one occasion German tanks nearly overran a field battery but were beaten back by the Division's Achilles self-propelled 17 pounder guns, one shooting through both walls of a barn to knock out a Panther.\n On 7 August the Guards had a short break as the Germans concentrated their forces on a counter-offensive against the Americans at Mortain. On that day the Guards were given the 11th Armoured Divisions area to defend as well, freeing up the 11th Armoured. While not actually trying to launch a major advance, attacks in the local area were fierce, particularly around Chenedolle. Support from other arms was also provided, with the Welsh infantry regiment supported by Churchill tanks of the 6th Guards Tank Brigade and the Household Cavalry deploying as infantry in the line for a brief period.\n On the 15th the Germans started to withdraw but were caught in the Falaise pocket, allowing the Guards to recover for a refit. Bluecoat had been a success and the combined arms of the battlegroup concept had been proven. This would be the way the Guards Armoured Division would operate from now on. The division took heavy losses in the operation, though the Allies had enough replacements that they could lose six tanks for every German tank destroyed. Crew were a different matter, however, and a consequence of the operation was the removal of the Crusader AA tanks, possible due to the lack of air opposition; their crews were used to man the replacement Shermans provided to the division.\n The Guards were not committed to the fighting in the Falaise Pocket, but instead got a chance to rest and regroup. On the 27th they were transferred to XXX Corps under Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks and advanced on the River Seine. Due to the near total collapse of the German Army in France they reached and crossed the river on the 29th. Here some more changes were made to the Guards organization. The use of an Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment had not proved successful, while armoured cars had prove more adapt at the role, despite the disadvantage of being more tied to the road network. Consequently, the 2nd Household Cavalry were formally attached as the official division reconnaissance element. This freed up the Welsh Guards tank crews for other duties, and formal battlegroups were formed. These were far more organized than the previous ad-hoc affair, with each regiment's battalions being merged to form a battlegroup. The Grenadier battlegroup consisted of the tanks of the 2nd Battalion and the motor infantry of the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards. The 1st Grenadier were a special case, as they traded in half their anti-tank guns to form extra infantry from the crews to give themselves the manpower to achieve this task. This required some rearranging of the division: although occasionally altered, the Grenadier and Irish groups formed the 5th Brigade, and the Coldstream and Welsh groups made the 32nd Brigade. Machine-gun support was provided by the Grenadier Guards for the 5th Brigade and the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers in the 32nd. The heavy 4.2-inch mortars were kept at divisional level and allocated where required.\n Having broken out from Normandy, the terrain change and the countryside became much more open and flowing. The advance was now generally along a road, with the lead elements and Typhoon air support brushing aside most opposition before it could delay the column. The population was grateful for their liberation; the 2nd Household Cavalry, who were generally first into the town, had to keep a sharp eye on stowage and aerials on the exterior of the vehicle lest it be taken as a souvenir. In one town, only the intervention of the police prevented a scout car having its wheels removed. The population were starving, having been deprived of food by the Germans, and supplies and chocolate were dished out to the grateful population. On 3 September Brussels was liberated by the Guards Armoured Division after a high-speed run, the division advancing 75 miles in one day. The division could not rest long however, pushing further into north-east Belgium against stiffening German opposition. After gaining support from the 11th Armoured Division, the Guards reached the border with the Netherlands, the Irish Guards under JOE Vandeleur seizing \"Joe's Bridge\", a bridge over the Meuse-Escault canal in a surprise assault.\n The Guards Armoured Division was then withdrawn from the line to prepare for Operation Market Garden. They formed the spearhead of the attacks into the Netherlands, with the Grenadier Guards managing to seize the Nijmegen Bridge with the help of the US 82nd Airborne Division.[9] Following this they spent the winter in the Netherlands and Germany, before being moved into Belgium as a reserve against the Battle of the Bulge. The infantry of the Welsh Guards were also replaced by the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards, due to a severe lack of replacements in the British Army at the time. Following this the division participated in Operation Veritable, the operation to clear the Reichswald forest. Due to the weather and the Germans flooding the area, only the infantry ended up playing an active part. After this the towed batteries of the Royal Artillery anti-tank guns were converted to infantry for the lack of targets. The division then supported the push over the Rhine before breaking into Germany and fighting up towards the Netherlands and along the German coast. Two Victoria Crosses were awarded to the division for the fighting during this period; neither recipient survived the war. They were Guardsman Edward Charlton of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards and Captain Ian Liddell of the 5th Battalion, Coldstream Guards.\n After the German surrender the Guards were mostly involved in mopping up operations and occupation duties. A small detachment was used to test the new Centurion universal tank, six of which had arrived in Germany, too late to be used in the conflict. Eventually the division was selected for conversion back to infantry, and held a \"goodbye to armour\" parade on 9 June; Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery took the final salute.\n Although its paper organization remained one armoured brigade and one mechanized infantry brigade, after Normandy the division generally fought as four combined-arms battlegroups, two under each brigade headquarters.\n Division Headquarters and Staff\nGeneral Staff Officer 1st grade (GSO1)\n 5th Guards Armoured Brigade\n 32nd Guards Brigade\n Field Security\n The Guards Armoured Division only had three General Officer Commanding, during its existence:\n", " Frederick Herman Korth (September 9, 1909 \u2013 September 14, 1998) served as the 56th U.S. Secretary of the Navy during 1962-63; he was also an Assistant Secretary of the Army in 1952-53.\n Appointed as Navy Secretary by President John F. Kennedy on January 4, 1962, Korth resigned October 14, 1963 effective November 1, 1963. Various sources cite different reasons for Secretary Korth's departure.[1]\n Korth was born in September 1909 in Yorktown, Texas, the son of Eleanor Maria (Stark) and Fritz R. J. Korth, who was a banker and rancher.[2] In later life, he lived in Coronado Country Club Estates, El Paso, Texas and Foxhall, Washington, D.C.\n He was president of the Continental National Bank of Fort Worth, Texas. Continental National Bank was one of a number of banks which participated in a line of credit for the TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental), which later emerged as the more well-known F-111 Aardvark. When asked about this alleged conflict of interest at a press conference, President Kennedy responded, \"...I have no evidence that Mr. Korth acted in any way improperly in the TFX matter....I have no evidence that Mr. Korth benefited improperly during his term of office in the Navy, and I have no evidence, and you have not, as I understand the press has not produced any, nor the McClellan Committee, which would indicate that in any way he acted improperly in the TFX. I have always believed that innuendoes should be justified before they are made, either by me and the Congress, or even in the press.\"[3] A commentary in the May, 1985 edition of Proceedings magazine exonerates Korth for any improprieties relating to the awarding of TFX.\n When he was not serving in the above public or private sector capacities, Fred Korth was a lawyer in private practice. One of his better known cases[4] was a small one heard June 24, 1948 in the County of Tarrant, Texas, when his client, Edwin A. Ekdahl, was officially divorced from Marguerite Frances Claverie Ekdahl (also known as Marguerite Oswald), whose son from a previous marriage was Lee Harvey Oswald.[5] Following the end of Korth's first marriage in 1964, he began a romantic relationship with heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, daughter of breakfast-cereal magnate C. W. Post, twenty years his senior. He was a co-executor of Post's will. Part of her estate was her mansion on Palm Beach Island, Mar-a-Lago, purchased in 1980 by Donald Trump.\n On August 23, 1980 at Immaculate Conception Church in Washington, D.C., he wed widowed Charlotte Brooks Williams.[6][7] Korth died in September 1998 in El Paso, Texas and buried under a three century old Texas Live Oak tree on his ranch in Karnes County, Texas.[8]\n His stepdaughter, Melissa Williams O'Rourke, is the mother of former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke.[9]\n", " The 2012 UCI World Tour was the fourth edition of the ranking system launched by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 2009.

Katzir previously worked as a consultant and as the Managing Director of the Broad Foundation.[12]\n Former LAUSD principal Howard Lappin was hired for school year 2004-05 to run College-Ready Academy High School.

She is a two-time Olympic medalist (silver in 1998, bronze in 2002), a five-time World champion (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003) and a nine-time U.S. champion (1996, 1998\u20132005). She is tied with Maribel Vinson for the all-time National Championship record.\n She competed at the senior level for over a decade and is the most decorated figure skater in U.S. history.[3] Known for her consistency and expressive artistry on ice, she is widely considered one of the greatest figure skaters of all time.[4]\n For well over a decade, Kwan maintained her status not only as America's most popular figure skater but as one of America's most popular female athletes.[5] During her reign Kwan landed numerous major endorsement deals, starred in multiple TV specials and was the subject of extensive media coverage.[6] From 1997 to 2005, she was the U.S. Figure Skating Association's top-paid skater in appearance fees and prize money,[7] as well as one of the highest paid Winter Olympic athletes in endorsements.[8][9] Kwan was also the highest paid skater on the Champions on Ice tours.[10]\n Born in Torrance, California, Michelle is the third child of Danny Kwan and Estella Kwan, immigrants from Hong Kong.[11] As a child, Kwan grew up speaking a mixture of Cantonese and English at home.[12] Kwan's interest in figure skating began at the age of five when she followed her two older siblings (ice hockey player Ron and figure skater Karen) onto the ice.[13] Karen and Michelle began serious training when Michelle was about eight years old. They practiced three to four hours a day, waking up at 4:30am and arriving at the rink at 5:00am to skate before school, and then going back to the rink right after school to skate again. Paying for their increased skating-rink time led to financial hardship for Kwan's working-class family. When Kwan was ten years old, her family could no longer afford a coach, but they were offered financial assistance by a fellow member of the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club[14]- Michelle Kwan, Heart of a Champion, .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN\u00a00-590-76340-7</ref> that allowed them to train at the Ice Castle International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead, California.\n Kwan attended Soleado Elementary School in Palos Verdes, California, but left public school to be homeschooled in 1994, when she was in the 8th grade.[15] After graduation from Rim of the World High School in 1998, Kwan attended UCLA for one year. In the fall of 2006, she transferred to the University of Denver.[16] In June 2009, she graduated from Denver's Josef Korbel School of International Studies with a bachelor's degree in international studies and a minor in political science.[17] In 2009, she began graduate studies in international relations at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University[18] and graduated in 2011.[19][20] On May 8, 2010, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Southern Vermont College.[21]\n Kwan won five World Championships (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003), tying her with Carol Heiss (1956\u20131960) for the most world titles by an American. Kwan's nine world medals overall is the all-time record for an American skater in any discipline. The only ladies' singles skater with more world titles or medals is Sonia Henie of Norway. Kwan won nine U.S. Championships (1996, 1998\u20132005), tying the record for most wins set by Maribel Vinson-Owen (1928\u20131933, 1935\u20131937). She holds the record for the most consecutive U.S. titles (eight) and most consecutive U.S. Championship medals (twelve). She also earned the silver medal at the 1998 Nagano Olympics and the bronze medal in the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. Kwan has received a combined total of 57 perfect marks (6.0s) at major competitions, the singles record under the former 6.0 judging system.[3]\n In 1991, Michelle Kwan and her sister Karen began training with Frank Carroll in Lake Arrowhead, California. After one year of coaching by Carroll, 11-year-old Michelle placed 9th at the junior level at the United States Figure Skating Championships. At the age of 12 in 1992, Michelle passed the gold test to become a senior-level figure skater despite the disapproval of her coach. In 1993, Kwan finished sixth at her first senior U.S. championships. The next season, she won the 1994 World Junior Championships.\n In 1994, Kwan finished second to Tonya Harding at the U.S. Championships, which ordinarily would have placed her on the U.S. team to the 1994 Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. That place was instead given to 1993 national champion Nancy Kerrigan, who had been sidelined by an assault and battery (eventually connected to Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly) after a practice session at those championships. The 13-year-old Kwan went to Norway as an alternate but did not compete. Kerrigan and Harding both dropped out of eligible competition before the 1994 World Championships. Because of this (and teammate Nicole Bobek not making out of the qualifying round), Kwan had the sole responsibility to ensure two entries for the U.S. at the 1994 World Championships by placing in the top ten. Kwan had an unusual mistake in the short program and placed eleventh in that portion of the competition, but skated a strong freestyle program and finished eighth overall.\n At the 1995 U.S. Championships, Nicole Bobek won the gold medal, while Kwan again placed second after struggling with her lutz jump in both the short program and free skate. At the 1995 World Championships, she placed fifth in the short program portion of the competition with a clean performance. She landed seven triple jumps in her free skating performance and placed third in that portion of the competition. She finished fourth overall.\n Michelle began to develop a more mature style in 1996. Her new, more artistically expressive programs were \"Romanza\" (short program) and \"Salome\" (free skate). She also improved her extension, speed and jump technique, and performed to more difficult choreography.  She won both the U.S. Championships and the World Championships in 1996. In the later event, she edged out defending champion Chen Lu in a very close competition in which both competitors garnered two perfect 6.0s for Presentation in the free skate.\n In the 1996\u201397 season, Kwan skated to \"Dream of Desdemona\" (short program) and \"Taj Mahal\" (free skate). During this season, Kwan struggled with her jumps because of a growth spurt and problems with new skating boots which she wore for an endorsement contract with the manufacturer.[22] She fell twice and stumbled once in her free skate at 1997 U.S. Nationals, losing the title to Tara Lipinski. She lost the Champion Series Final to Lipinski a month later. At the World Championships, Kwan stepped out of her triple lutz combination and placed 4th in the Short Program portion of the competition behind Lipinski, France's Vanessa Gusmeroli, and Russia's Maria Butyrskaya.  Kwan skated a six triple, mistake-free performance to win the freestyle portion of the competition, but placed second to Lipinski overall.\n Kwan started out the 1997\u20131998 Olympic season by winning Skate America (where she defeated Tara Lipinski) and then Skate Canada. However, she suffered a stress fracture on her foot and was forced to withdraw from her third Champions Series Final. Kwan regained her U.S. title from Lipinski at the 1998 National Championships, despite her fractured toe. Many people consider her performances of her Rachmaninoff short program and free skate set to William Alwyn's \"Lyra Angelica\" at the 1998 U.S. Championships to be the high point of her career from both a technical and artistic standpoint.[23] The performances earned her fifteen perfect 6.0s and left two judges in tears.[24]\n Kwan and Lipinski were co-favorites to win the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. Kwan placed first in the Short Program portion of the competition, winning eight first place votes out of nine judges. In the free skate, Kwan skated a clean 7-triple performance but placed behind Lipinski, who also did 7 triples including a triple loop/triple loop combination and a triple toe-loop/half-loop/Triple Salchow. Kwan ended up winning the silver medal, with the gold medal going to Tara Lipinski and the bronze medal to Chen Lu.[25]\n Lipinski and Chen both retired from competitive skating shortly after the Olympics, while Kwan went on to win the 1998 World Championships in Minneapolis.\n Kwan continued to compete as an eligible skater in the 1998\u201399 season, although she bypassed the fall Grand Prix season and instead chose to skate in a series of made-for-television pro-am events. Her \"regular\" competitive programs that season were \"Fate of Carmen\" (short program) and \"Lamento D'Ariane\" (free skate). Kwan won her third national title at the 1999 U.S. Championships, competing against a weak field. At the 1999 World Championships, Kwan did not skate her best,[26] and placed second behind Russian competitor Maria Butyrskaya.[27]\n Kwan's win at the 2000 U.S. Nationals was controversial to some.[28] She was criticized for planning an easier solo jump in her short program than some of her competitors (a triple toe loop rather than a triple flip), and fell on this element in the competition. The judges nevertheless placed her third in that segment behind younger challengers Sasha Cohen and Sarah Hughes;[29] however, the placement still kept her in contention for the title. Ultimately, she won the free skate with the best performance of the night, capturing 8 of the 9 first-place ordinals.[30] At the 2000 World Championships, Kwan was again in third place after the short program, behind Maria Butyrskaya and Irina Slutskaya. In her free skate, Kwan landed seven triple jumps, including a triple toe loop/triple toe loop combination, and won that segment of the competition. Butyrskaya lost her commanding lead by finishing third behind Slutskaya in the free skate, allowing Kwan to win the overall title as well.[31]\n During the 2000\u20132001 season, Kwan began working with the famed designer (and former figure skater) Vera Wang, who designed most of her competition and exhibition costumes for the next six years. Kwan was only the second figure skater Wang designed for, following Nancy Kerrigan.[32] At that year's national championships, Kwan again won the title, receiving first-place ordinals from all 9 judges in both the short program and free skate. At the 2001 World Championships, Kwan was second behind Slutskaya in the short program. Kwan won the title with her \"Song of the Black Swan\" free skate, executing 7 triples, including a triple toe loop/triple toe loop combination.[33]\n Kwan and Carroll decided to end their coaching relationship two days before the start of the 2001 Skate America competition.[13] In interviews, Kwan said she needed to \"take responsibility\" for her skating.[34] Coachless, Kwan arrived at the 2002 U.S. Championships in Los Angeles amid the media's scrutiny over her separation with Carroll and her season's inconsistencies. Kwan won the competition with a revived \"Rachmaninoff\" short program and a new \"Scheherazade\" program for her free skate, securing a place on the 2002 Olympic team. Joining her on the team were Sasha Cohen (second) and Sarah Hughes (third).[35] The 21-year-old Kwan and Russia's Irina Slutskaya were favorites to win the gold. Kwan led after the short program, followed by Slutskaya, Cohen, and Hughes. In the free skate, Kwan two-footed her triple toe loop combination and fell on her triple flip, while Sarah Hughes skated a clean program. Kwan won the bronze medal behind Hughes and Slutskaya.[36] Kwan's final event of the season was the 2002 Worlds, where she won the silver medal behind Slutskaya.\n Kwan began working with coach Scott Williams in the summer of 2002.[13] She continued to compete on the Olympic-eligible circuit, although in a more limited way. During the fall seasons of 2002 to 2004, Kwan competed in only one Grand Prix event, Skate America in the fall of 2002, which she entered as a last-minute replacement. She won the event and qualified for the Grand Prix Final but chose not to compete in it. Kwan chose to not compete in Grand Prix events in the 2003 and 2004 seasons where the new judging system was being used. Kwan won all phases of every competition she entered in the 2002\u20132003 competitive season with her programs: Peter Gabriel's \"The Feeling Begins\" from The Last Temptation of Christ (short program) and \"Concierto de Aranjuez\" (free skate). She won the U.S. Championships again and regained her World title.\n In autumn 2003, she hired the noted technician Rafael Arutyunyan as her coach,[13] with whom she attempted to increase the technical difficulty of her programs and hone her jump technique. In the 2003\u20132004 competitive season, she skated again to \"The Feeling Begins\" for her short program, and Puccini's \"Tosca\" for her long program. Again, Kwan won the U.S. Championships, earning seven more 6.0s for presentation during the free skating. At the 2004 World Championships, after a difficult qualifying round, Kwan was penalized in her short program for going two seconds over the time limit. This caused her to place fourth going into the long program, behind American Sasha Cohen, Japan's Shizuka Arakawa, and Miki Ando.[37] Kwan skated a clean performance with five triples and received the last 6.0 marks given at the World Championships. She placed second in the free skating portion (she was one judge short from winning the free skating) and placed third overall, behind Arakawa (who performed seven triples, including two triple-triple combinations) and Cohen.\n For the 2004\u20132005 competitive season, Kwan skated her long program to \"Bol\u00e9ro\", choreographed by British ice dancer Christopher Dean who had famously skated to the music with Jayne Torvill two decades before, and debuted a new short program, \"Adagio\" from Aram Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus. At the U.S. Championships, she won her 9th title, tying the all-time record previously set by Maribel Vinson-Owen. Vinson-Owen had coached Frank Carroll, who in turn coached Kwan. At the 2005 World Championship, Kwan competed for the first time under the new judging system. She had a rough qualifying round and placed third in the short program. In the free skate, Kwan fell on her triple salchow and two-footed a triple lutz. Although she finished third in both the short and long program portion of the competition, Kwan was edged by Carolina Kostner for the bronze medal and finished fourth overall, missing third place by 0.37 points. It was the first time since 1995 that Kwan had failed to medal at any international competition, and would be her final competitive event.\n Kwan looked at the 2005 Worlds as a learning experience in the ISU Judging System. She continued to train and stated that she would attempt to qualify for the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, Italy.[38] However, following a hip injury, she was forced to withdraw from her three planned competitions in the fall of 2005. Kwan skated her new short program (\"Totentanz\") at a made-for-TV event in December 2005, but her performance was well below her usual standard. On January 4, 2006, Kwan withdrew from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships with an abdominal injury incurred in December 2005. One week later, she filed a petition with the USFSA for a medical waiver to be placed on the 2006 Olympic figure skating team.[38] On January 14, 2006, after the United States ladies' figure skating event, the USFSA's International Committee met and in a 20 to 3 vote approved Kwan's petition under the stipulation that she show her physical and competitive readiness to a five-member monitoring panel by January 27.\n Kwan performed her long and short programs for the panel on the stipulated day, and her spot on the Olympic team was established, as the panel felt she was fit to compete. However, on February 12, 2006, the United States Olympic Committee announced that Kwan had withdrawn from the Games after suffering a new groin injury in her first practice in Turin. Kwan remarked that she \"respected the Olympics too much to compete\".[39] The Turin organizing committee accepted the USOC's application for Emily Hughes (who had finished third at the U.S. Championships) to compete as Kwan's replacement.\n After her withdrawal from the Olympic team, Kwan turned down an offer to stay in Turin as a figure skating commentator for NBC Sports.[40] During an interview with Bob Costas and Scott Hamilton, Kwan said she was not retiring yet.\n Kwan underwent elective arthroscopic surgery in August 2006 to repair a torn labrum in her right hip, an old injury which she traces back to 2002.[16] According to Kwan, the surgery allowed her to skate pain-free for the first time in four years.[41]\n Kwan did not compete during the 2006\u20132007 figure skating season.[42]\n Kwan told the Associated Press in October 2007 that she would decide in 2009 if she planned to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics,[41] but she ultimately decided not to do so, focusing instead on graduate school.[43] She has said \"Representing the United States as an American Public Diplomacy Envoy the past three years has been very rewarding, and I want to do more.\" After graduating from the University of Denver in 2009, Kwan said \"Furthering my education will bring me closer to that goal, and I don't want to wait any longer to continue the journey.\"[43]\n On February 17, 2010, Kwan told ABC News in an interview that she was continuing her studies as a graduate student at the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, as well as continuing her work as a Public Diplomacy Envoy. Kwan also said she would be commentating for Good Morning America at the 2010 Winter Olympics.[44]\n In August 2009, Kwan made her first on-ice appearance in several years, performing at Ice All Stars, a show headlined by South Korean world champion Yuna Kim in Seoul, South Korea. Kim considered Kwan her idol growing up.[45] Kwan also later appeared in Kim's All That Skate shows in South Korea and Los Angeles.[46]\n She was chosen as the guest of honor to help open a new synthetic skating rink at the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore in December 2010, where she performed a modified routine to \"Winter Song\", a program she self-choreographed with her sister.[47] She returned to Singapore a month later as a Public Diplomacy Envoy[48] to meet local students and to promote ice skating in the tropical country.[49]\n As of 2008, Kwan is a member of the Chinese-American organization Committee of 100.[50] In 2014, Kwan joined Fox Sports 1 for its Winter Olympics broadcast.[51]\n Kwan was known for her unrivaled consistency in delivering clean programs,[52] as well as her strong skating skills and deep, quiet edges that have been described as \"silent blades\"[53] that \"barely whispered\".[54]\n Although not of the greatest height nor explosive spring nor sustained landing, Kwan, for most of her career, included all of the triples (except for the axel) in her programs, including two lutzes (the most difficult jump after the axel). She landed the triple toe-triple toe combination cleanly eleven times in competition, including at her 2000 and 2001 world championship victories.[55] During the 2004\u20132005 season, she debuted a triple flip-double toe-double loop combination.[56]\n Beginning in the 1996\u20131997 season, Kwan debuted a change of edge spiral that soon became her signature move.[57] Kwan's spiral was famed by commentators not only for its great extension and line, but also its speed, the strength and security of the edge, the deep lean and the easy smoothness of the change of edge.[58] In the 1998\u20131999 season, Kwan revived a variation of the Charlotte spiral, a move innovated by German skater Charlotte Oelschl\u00e4gel which had not been performed in decades.[59]\n Kwan's split falling leaf was praised by skating legends Dick Button and Peggy Fleming during competitions for its effortlessness and perfect split position in the air. Kwan has done multiple split falling leaves in immediate succession (without any turns or steps in between) while maintaining a split position on both.[60]\n Another of her trademark moves is a Y-spin done consecutively on both feet.  Kwan is also one of the few skaters who can spin in both directions.[61]\n Kwan is a recipient of the prestigious James E. Sullivan Award (2001), which is given to America's best amateur athlete; she was the first figure skater to win the award since Dick Button in 1949. In 2003, she was named the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) \"Sportswoman of the Year\", and is the 5th figure skater in history to receive this honor. She has also been named USOC \"Athlete of the Month\" fourteen times, which is more than any other athlete, male or female, as well as being named \"Female Figure Skating Athlete of the Year\" by the USOC multiple times. She is also the recipient of the USOC's \"Citizenship Through Sports Alliance Award\" (2004).[3]\n Kwan is one of only two multiple winners of the \"Readers' Choice Figure Skater of the Year\" award given by Skating magazine, winning it an unprecedented seven times (1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001\u20132003). In 2003, the United States Figure Skating Association, which publishes Skating, announced that the award would be renamed the \"Michelle Kwan Trophy.\" The USFSA stated that although Kwan may continue to skate competitively, she would no longer be eligible for the award. The only other skater to win the award multiple times, Johnny Weir, only won it twice in comparison.[3][62]\n On November 9, 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice named Michelle Kwan as a public diplomacy ambassador. In this non-salaried position, Kwan represented American values, especially to young people and sports enthusiasts, and traveled widely.[72] Kwan made her first overseas trip in the capacity of public diplomacy ambassador with a visit to China from January 17\u201325, 2007.[73]\n Her diplomatic position as an envoy continued in the Barack Obama administration where she worked with Vice President Joe Biden[74] and then Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.[75]\n Following her first trip to China as a public diplomacy envoy, Kwan continued her role in subsequent trips to Russia in June 2007,[76] Argentina in March 2008,[77] Ukraine in February 2009,[78] South Korea in January 2010,[79] and Singapore in January 2011.[48][80]\n On April 15, 2011, it was announced that Kwan would serve as an adviser to the U.S.-China Women's Leadership Exchange and Dialogue (Women-LEAD).[81] In December 2012, Kwan was appointed as a State Department senior adviser for public diplomacy and public affairs.[82]\n In June 2015, Michelle Kwan announced that she will support Hillary Clinton's campaign efforts by working on outreach efforts from Clinton's headquarters in Brooklyn.[83]\n Kwan has guest-starred as herself in \"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\", an episode of The Simpsons, and in the Family Guy episode \"A Hero Sits Next Door\". She has also made guest star appearances in Arthur, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, and various other television series. She provided the voice of a shopkeeper in Disney's direct-to-DVD sequel Mulan II, and she and fellow figure skater Brian Boitano appeared as announcers in the film Ice Princess.\n In 1998, Kwan struck a deal with Walt Disney Television that led to her starring in 3 prime-time skating specials on ABC: \"Reflections on Ice\" in 1998 (an ice skating adaptation of the Disney film Mulan, based on the Chinese legend), \"Michelle Kwan skates to Disney's Greatest Hits\" in 1999, and \"Princess on Ice\" in 2001, the last special featuring performances by pop bands O-Town and Shedaisy.[84] She also appeared in various other televised skating specials throughout her career.\n In 1999, she appeared in the Michelle Kwan Figure Skating computer game, released by Electronic Arts.[85]\n Scholastic published an autobiography by Kwan in 1998, titled Heart of a Champion, which is now in its sixth printing.[3]\n In 1999, Kwan signed with Disney Publishing Worldwide for an 8-book deal which included an inspirational book for children titled, The Winning Attitude: What it Takes to be a Champion, as well as a series of fictional skating books inspired by Kwan and written by Nola Thacker called \"Michelle Kwan presents Skating Dreams\".[86]\n In 2005, Kwan's family opened the EastWest Ice Palace in Artesia, California. The ice rink houses many of her skating medals and memorabilia.[87]\n In January 2009, Kwan was appointed a member of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports by George W. Bush, a role which she had continued into the Obama administration.[88]\n Kwan has been a longtime supporter of the Special Olympics, taking part in \"unified sports\" events, which bring together athletes with intellectual disabilities and without. In 2011, she was added to the board of directors for the Special Olympics.[89]\n Kwan has had many endorsement contracts throughout her career, including Aim Funds,[90] Campbell's,[91] Caress soap (Unilever),[92] Chevrolet,[93] Coca-Cola,[94] Disney,[10] East West Bank,[95] Got milk?,[96] Kraft,[97] Mattel,[98] Maxxis,[99] McDonald's,[100] Minute Maid,[94] Riedell Skates,[101] Royal Caribbean International,[102] Starbucks,[99] United Airlines,[90] Visa,[94] and Yoplait.[8]\n Kwan's multi-year deal with Chevrolet (starting in 2000) was estimated to be worth over $1 million.[93]  The Chevrolet/Michelle Kwan R.E.W.A.R.D.S. Scholarship program was established by the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors in cooperation with Kwan.[103]\n In 2002, Kwan was named a \"celebrity representative\" and spokeswoman for The Walt Disney Company in a three-year deal reported to be worth $1 million a year.[10] This deal was renewed and expanded in 2006.[104]\n In September 2012, Kwan announced her engagement to Clay Pell, an American lawyer, military officer and director for strategic planning on the National Security staff at the White House. In February 2014, he declared his candidacy for Governor of Rhode Island.[105] Pell is the grandson of the late Rhode Island Senator Claiborne Pell. The couple, who met in April 2011,[106] were married on January 19, 2013, in Providence, Rhode Island. Vera Wang designed Kwan's wedding gown.[107][108] Pell filed for divorce from Kwan in March 2017 in California.[109] A day later Kwan filed for divorce from Pell in Rhode Island;[110] Kwan's attempts to serve Pell directly in April 2017 were unsuccessful.[111]\n Kwan worked as a surrogate to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign as an outreach coordinator.[112]\n Major events for Olympic-eligible skaters include the World Figure Skating Championships, the Olympic Winter Games, the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating, and for American skaters, the U.S. Championships. Kwan's record in these events is listed by season in the tables below.\n", " Father Time is a fictional character, a supervillain in publications from DC Comics. The character first appeared in Seven Soldiers: Frankenstein #3 (April 2006), and was created by Grant Morrison and Doug Mahnke.[1]\n Father Time is the commander of the Super Human Advanced Defense Executive (S.H.A.D.E.), a Patriot Act-funded covert operations group employing metahumans to fight terrorism. His own concerns appear to have at least as much to do with consolidating power as with national security. In Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters #1, he assassinates a presidential candidate applying too much scrutiny on S.H.A.D.E., and replaces him with a double, Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard.[1]\n Father Time first appeared in Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers of Victory: Frankenstein #3, temporarily pressing the undead assassin into S.H.A.D.E. service. During the event known as World War III, Time and S.H.A.D.E. try to stop the rampaging Black Adam, and Adam rips off Time's face.[1]\n Time, confined to a hospital bed, then metamorphoses into a new form. He next appeared in the Infinite Crisis tie-in The Battle for Bl\u00fcdhaven, and appears to be a major player in the new Freedom Fighters miniseries.\n Father Time is reborn in a new body on New Year's Day to accompany the new year. In Frankenstein, he appears as a young black man wearing a costume resembling The Spirit's, but wearing a bowler hat. This is his appearance when Black Adam rips his face off. The Father Time shown in Freedom Fighters, on the other hand, is an elderly white man with long hair and a Buffalo Bill beard, except for the seventh and eighth issues, in which he resembles an African-American Doctor Occult. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. Father Time still exists in this new timeline, first seen with the appearance of an elementary-age Japanese girl, complete with school uniform, wearing a domino mask.\n For most of the new Uncle Sam and The Freedom Fighters series, Father Time was depicted as a villain, but in issue eight he reveals that he knew the danger Gonzo posed all along, and created the new versions of Doll Man, Phantom Lady, etc., to bring Uncle Sam forth, make his new team heroes in the public eye, and defeat Gonzo's plan. When Gonzo is defeated, Time takes himself and his S.H.A.D.E. soldiers into the timestream.\n Father Time possesses enhanced strength, enough to engage the Atomic Knights in battle. At the beginning of each year, he regenerates and takes on a new appearance. In The New 52, Father Time has stated that he generates a new appearance every decade rather than every year.\n", " Isaac Johannes Lamotius (bapt. 29 May 1646 in Beverwijk \u2013 1718)[1] or (1653\u20131710)[2] was governor of Mauritius from 1677 to 1692. Lamotius was interested in arts and knowledge and became an ichthyologist; he made 250 drawings of fishes which are kept in Paris.[3]\n Isaac was the son of Johannes Lamotius, who played a main part in the capturing of Dutch Malacca (January 1641) and married in Batavia the widow of Matthijs Quast. As a sergeant major, Johannes was stationed in Dutch Formosa (September 1642\u2013?).[4][5][6] In 1653 Johannes Lamotius lived in Beverwijk, Netherlands. \n Isaac arrived on the island in September 1677. In 1682 Joan Huydecoper II strongly urged the colonial administrators to undertake botanical research and stimulated the production of drawings of plants on the spot. He gave him instructions how to start a herbarium. In 1685 Huydecoper requested subtropical plants. A cucumis arrived the year after in Amsterdam.[7] Lamotius became an expert on the fauna and fauna of Mauritius and published daily journals. In 1688 the last three dodos were captured.\n Some say his fifteen years of command saw the island descend into despotism, and immorality was rife. When people complained in 1692, Lamotius and his second man were shipped to Batavia and tried in 1695, sentenced for private trade. He was banished for six years to the island of Rosengain, being chained on the most eastern of the Banda Islands.\n", " \n Bursaspor Kul\u00fcb\u00fc Derne\u011fi (Turkish pronunciation:\u00a0[bu\u027esaspo\u027e kulyby d\u00e6\u027eneji]), commonly known as Bursaspor, is a professional Turkish sports club located in the city of Bursa, Turkey. Formed in 1963, the club colours are green and white, with home kits usually featuring both colours in a striped pattern.\n In the 2009\u201310 season the men's football department of Bursaspor won its first S\u00fcper Lig title after finishing with 75 points, one point ahead of the runners-up Fenerbah\u00e7e.[3][4] Bursaspor became the second club outside Istanbul to win a S\u00fcper Lig title, joining Trabzonspor who won the first of its six titles in 1975\u201376.[5] The club has also won the Turkish Cup once and the Prime Minister's Cup twice, as well as the First League twice.[6] The club's first, and most successful foray into European competition came in the 1974\u201375 European Cup Winners' Cup when it reached the quarter-finals. Bursaspor also took part in the 1986\u201387, losing in the first round, as well as the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup, where it lost in the quarter-finals.[7]\n The club was founded on 1 June 1963 after Acar \u0130dman Yurdu, Ak\u0131nspor, \u0130stiklal, P\u0131narspor and \u00c7elikspor were merged to form a single club; Bursaspor. Green and white were chosen as the club colours, and the club entered the 2. Lig in 1963\u201364.[2] Their first match took place on 21 September 1963 against \u0130zmir Demirspor in \u0130zmir.[8] Bursaspor were promoted to the S\u00fcper Lig after winning the 1966\u201367 2. Lig. They won 19 of their 30 matches, finishing with 45 points, eight ahead of second placed Samsunspor.[6] They were relegated to the 2. Lig in 1985\u201386 and were relegated again in 1986\u201387 season, but their relegations were revoked due to winning the Turkish Cup in 1986 and a Turkish Council of State verdict in 1987.[citation needed] Their most recent relegation came in 2004. They gained promotion back into the S\u00fcper Lig after winning the First League on 16 May 2006. Bursaspor won their first major cup in 1971, beating Fenerbah\u00e7e 1\u20130 after extra time in the now-defunct Prime Minister's Cup. Because Fenerbah\u00e7e had won the league and cup in 1973\u201374, Bursaspor, as 1974 Turkish Cup runners up, were given a place in the 1974-75 European Cup Winners' Cup. Bursaspor reached the quarter-finals, beating Finn Harps and Dundee United, before falling to eventual champions Dynamo Kyiv. The club's first Turkish Cup win came in 1986 when they defeated Altay 2\u20130 in the finals.[6] The club therefore qualified for the 1986\u201387 European Cup Winners' Cup, losing to eventual champions Ajax in the first round.[7]\n The 2009\u201310 season began successful and by the midpoint of the season, in December 2009; gameweek 17, the club were sitting in the top spot in the S\u00fcper Lig table. The first half of the season saw a 1\u20130 home victory against Istanbul giants Galatasaray, and also a 2\u20133 win away at Be\u015fikta\u015f. In late 2009, Sa\u011flam was linked with the vacant Turkey managerial position after Terim's resignation, but he refused to comment on the speculation. Guus Hiddink eventually took up the position. The latter part of the season saw a 6\u20130 win over mid\u2013table \u0130stanbul B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir Belediyespor, the largest win in the league to date this season, and also a 2\u20133 away win against Fenerbah\u00e7e after winning from two goals down. Bursaspor again reached the quarter-finals of the Turkish Cup and again they lost on aggregate to Fenerbah\u00e7e, this time crashing out 4\u20133 due to an injury time winner from Fener. In April 2010 Bursaspor sat at the top of the table after being in the top three for the past few months. With eight games left to play Bursaspor were five points clear at the top. Five weeks before the end of the season, Bursaspor fell to second place in the S\u00fcper Lig. They maintained pressure on Fenerbah\u00e7e who had overtaken them. Going into the final game of the season, Bursaspor were just one point behind Fener, and needed to better their results against defending champions Be\u015fikta\u015f. Knowing that the match against Be\u015fikta\u015f could prove decisive. With Fenerbah\u00e7e held to a 1\u20131 home draw against Trabzonspor, and Bursaspor beating Be\u015fikta\u015f 2\u20131, the Bursaspor were crowned champions, by just a single point. They are only the second club outside the \"Istanbul Big Three\" who have won the league. Trabzonspor were the other team, who last won in 1983\u201384. Before winning its first S\u00fcper Lig title in 2009\u201310, Bursaspor had never finished inside the top three. The club won its first title in Ertu\u011frul Sa\u011flam's first full season as manager of the club. Pablo Batalla and Ozan \u0130pek were the club's joint top scorers with eight goals apiece.[9] Bursaspor were drawn against Rangers, Valencia and Manchester United in the group stages of the 2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League.[10] In its away match against Rangers, Bursaspor decided not to don their home kit to avoid provoking Rangers' fans, as their kit heavily resembles that of Rangers' rivals, Celtic.[11] Bursaspor is the fourth football club in Turkey to start a dedicated television channel (Bursaspor TV).[12][not in citation given]\n Bursaspor's club badge includes the club name, foundation year, and the crescent moon and star from the Turkish flag. As a tribute to the club's origins, the badge also includes five stars, each a different colour\u00a0\u2013 black, red, yellow, green, and navy blue. This represents the colours used by the clubs that made up Bursaspor; Acar \u0130dman Yurdu\u2013black, Ak\u0131nspor\u2013red, \u0130stiklal\u2013yellow, P\u0131narspor\u2013green, \u00c7elikspor\u2013navy blue. Bursaspor's kit: Green shirts with white trim, green shorts, green socks. Away: Green and white hooped shirts, white shorts, green and white hooped socks. Alternate: Amber shirts with black trim, claret shorts, amber socks.\n Bursaspor plays its home matches at Timsah Arena. Built in 2015, the stadium currently seats 43,761 spectators.The field measures 68 by 105 meters, and is covered with natural grass.[13] Between 1979 and 2015 the club played at the Bursa Atat\u00fcrk Stadium.\n The club's main fan base is known as Teksas (Texas) and Legend Teksas.\n In the early 1990s Bursaspor's ultra group Teksas had a leader called Abdulkerim Bayraktar. He went to study in Ankara, and whilst in the city he started attending Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc games and started building ties between the two clubs. In 1993 however, his life was cut short during his military service when he was killed by terrorists. This tragic event bought Bursaspor and Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc even closer together. During the first game after his death, Bursaspor organised a tribute to him, and the events which happened next cemented the brotherhood between these two teams. A large group of Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc supporters made their way onto the pitch and unveiled a large banner reading 'Our brother Abdul will never die, he lives on in our hearts'. The two supporter groups united and hundreds of Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc ultras attended his funeral. From that day on, Bursaspor supporters would chant Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc's name in the 6th minute of every home game, 06 being significant due to 06 being Ankara's city code. Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc supporters in return chant Bursaspor's name during the 16th minute, 16 being Bursa's city code. When the two sides play, the supporters sit together; it is one of the rare occasions in which ultras from opposing teams watch a game together in a mixed environment. They bring BursAnkara scarfs (a merger of the two cities' names) to the games and create an atmosphere full of mutual respect.[14]\n 1 Karlsruhe progressed to the Semi-finals after winning a penalty shoot-out 6\u20135.\n2 Chikhura progressed to the third qualifying round after winning a penalty shoot-out 4\u20131.\n Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

These 5 bit words are pre-determined in a dictionary and they are chosen to ensure that there will be sufficient transitions in the line state to produce a self-clocking signal. A collateral effect of the code is that 25% more bits are needed to send the same information. \n An alternative to using 4B5B coding is to use a scrambler. Some systems use scramblers in conjunction with 4B5B coding to assure DC balance and improve electromagnetic compatibility.\n Depending on the standard or specification of interest, there may be several 5-bit output codes left unused.  The presence of any of the unused codes in the data stream can be used as an indication that there is a fault somewhere in the link.  Therefore, the unused codes can be used to detect errors in the data stream. \n 4B5B was popularized by fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) in the mid-1980s, and was later adopted by Fast Ethernet standard defined by IEEE 802.3u in 1995 and AES10-2003 Multichannel Audio Digital Interface (MADI).[1]\n The name 4B5B is generally taken to mean the FDDI version.  Other 4-to-5-bit codes have been used for magnetic recording and are known as group coded recording (GCR), but those are (0,2) run-length limited codes, with at most two consecutive zeros.  4B5B allows up to three consecutive zeros (a (0,3) RLL code), providing a greater variety of control codes.\n On optical fiber, the 4B5B output is NRZI-encoded.  FDDI over copper (CDDI) uses MLT-3 encoding instead, as does 100BASE-TX.\n The 4B5B encoding is also used for USB Power Delivery communication on CC pin, over BMC protocol.[citation needed]\n 4B5B codes are designed to produce at least two transitions per 5 bits of output code regardless of input data. When NRZI-encoded, the transitions provide necessary clock transitions for the receiver.  For example, a run of 4 bits such as 00002 contains no transitions and that causes clocking problems for the receiver. 4B5B solves this problem by assigning the 4-bit block a 5-bit code, in this case 111102. \n The following codes are sometimes referred to as command characters.\n (HDLC = High-Level Data Link Control)\n", " Julius from the kindred B\u00e1szt\u00e9ly (Hungarian: B\u00e1szt\u00e9ly nembeli Gyula; died between 1312 and 1315) was a Hungarian noble at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries.\n Julius was born into the gens (clan) B\u00e1szt\u00e9ly, which elevated into the social status of nobility due to military merits and successes of his father, Reynold II. His mother was Reynold's second wife, an unidentified sister of noble Nicholas Vecse de Putnok from the gens R\u00e1t\u00f3t. Julius had several siblings, including Ladislaus I, who was the first member of the late medieval powerful Rozgonyi family. Julius had a daughter Anne, who became a nun. His widow, Isalt Putnoki was still alive in 1325.[1]\n He was first mentioned by contemporary records in 1296. Presumably, he built the castle of Csicsva in Zempl\u00e9n County (present-day part of Sedlisk\u00e1 in Slovakia) in the early 1300s, but it is also possible that the fort was constructed already during his father's time.[2] Julius supported the claim of Charles of Anjou during the era of interregnum and war of succession in the first decade of the 14th century. His familiares \u2013 and certainly himself \u2013 participated in Charles' military campaign against the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1304. Belonging to his escort, Julius was present in Kassa (today Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia) on 5 September 1311, when the powerful oligarch and Charles' mainstay Amadeus Aba was assassinated. Julius managed to escape from the crime scene, when one of his servants handed him his horse.[3]\n Following the assassination, Charles I arbitrated an agreement between Amadeus' sons and the town, which also prescribed that the Abas withdraw from two counties and allow the noblemen inhabiting their domains to freely join Charles.[4] In accordance with the treaty, Julius was one of the those 47 lords, who offered hostages in order to preserve lasting peace. However, the Abas soon entered into an alliance with Matthew Cs\u00e1k against the king. Julius remained a loyal partisan of Charles during the conflict, as the king confirmed his donation letter to his servant on 14 June 1312, one day before the Battle of Rozgony.[3] Julius did not appear in contemporary documents thereafter. He died by 1315, as his nephews John and Peter confirmed one of his donations in January of that year.[3]\n", " Cookie Allez (born c. 1948) is a French novelist.\n Cookie Allez was born circa 1948.[1]\n She has written seven novels.[1]\n Her second novel, La Soupi\u00e8re, talked about a mother and her son, who works as a clinical assistant.[2]\n In her seventh novel, Dominique, published in 2015, Allez writes about a child whose parents do not tell him if he is a boy or a girl to go along with the theory of gender studies.[1][3]\n \n", " Pigol (Persian: \u067e\u064a \u06af\u0644\u200e, also Romanized as P\u012bgol)[1] is a village in Karvandar Rural District, in the Central District of Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

Against limited Spanish and Indian resistance, a network of missions was destroyed; most of the population either was killed or captured, fled to larger Spanish and French outposts, or voluntarily joined the English.\n The only major event of former Carolina Governor James Moore's expedition was the Battle of Ayubale, which marked the only large-scale resistance to the English raids.  Significant numbers of the Apalachee, unhappy with the conditions they lived in under the Spanish, simply abandoned their towns and joined Moore's expedition. They were resettled near the Savannah and Ocmulgee Rivers, where conditions were only slightly better.\n Moore's raiding expedition was preceded and followed by other raiding activity that was principally conducted by English-allied Creeks.  The cumulative effect of these raids, conducted between 1702 and 1709, was to depopulate Spanish Florida beyond the immediate confines of Saint Augustine and Pensacola.\n English and Spanish colonization efforts in southeastern North America began coming into conflict as early as the middle of the 17th century.  The founding in 1670 by the English of Charles Town (present-day Charleston, South Carolina) in the recently established (1663) Province of Carolina heightened tensions with the Spanish in Florida.[3] Traders, raiders, and slavers from the new province penetrated into Florida, leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides.[4] In 1700, Carolina's governor, Joseph Blake, threatened the Spanish with assertions that English claims to Pensacola, established by the Spanish in 1698, would be enforced.[5] Blake's death later that year interrupted these plans, and he was replaced in 1702 by James Moore.[5]\n The Spanish population of Florida at the time was fairly small compared to that of the nearby English colonies.  Since its founding in the 16th century, the Spanish had set up a network of missions whose primary purpose was to pacify the local Indian population and convert them to Roman Catholicism.  In the Apalachee Province (roughly present-day western Florida and southwestern Georgia) there were 14 mission communities with a total population in 1680 of about 8,000.  Many but not all of these communities were populated by the Apalachee; others were inhabited by other tribes that had migrated southward to the area.[6] By the early 18th century the Apalachee Province had become a major source of food for the principal towns of St. Augustine and Pensacola, which were situated near lands not well suited for agriculture.[7]\n The native populations of Florida were not entirely happy with Spanish rule; there had been several uprisings against the Spanish in the 17th century.[8] The Indians were often forced to do work for the Spanish military garrisons and plantation owners, including the labor of hauling goods to St. Augustine, about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away.  These policies, and mistreatment by overbearing Spanish masters, led some Apalachees to flee to the English in Carolina.[9] Spanish policy also forbade Indians the possession of muskets, which made them dependent on the Spanish for protection against the English-armed Creeks.[10]\n News that the War of the Spanish Succession (known in North America as Queen Anne's War) had widened to include England arrived in Carolina by September 1702, and Governor Moore convinced the provincial assembly in September 1702 to fund an expedition against St.\u00a0Augustine.[11] The expedition was a failure, and there was rioting in Charles Town over the expenses incurred.[12] One significant accomplishment of the St.\u00a0Augustine expedition was the destruction of coastal Spanish mission towns in Guale Province (present-day coastal Georgia).[13] After the expedition, Florida Governor Jos\u00e9 de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y la Cerda ordered the remaining Spanish missions in Apalachee and Timucua Province to be moved closer together for defensive purposes.[14][15] Missions in Mocama Province were consolidated south of the St. Johns River, and those in Timucua were consolidated at San Francisco de Potano.  In early 1703 Creeks attacked San Jos\u00e9 de Ocuya and San Francisco de Potano, also raiding either Patali or Piritiba; it is possible that as many as 500 Indians were enslaved as a result of these raids.[16]\n In 1703 ex-Governor Moore presented to the Carolina assembly and his replacement, Nathaniel Johnson, a plan for an expedition against the Spanish towns in Apalachee Province.[17] He promised that, unlike the St.\u00a0Augustine expedition, the colony would not have to pay for anything; he expected its costs to be recovered by the taking of loot and slaves.[18] On September 7, 1703, the Carolina assembly approved the plan, asking Moore to go \"to the Assistance of the Cowetaws and other our friendly Indians, and to attacque the Appalaches.\"[19] After recruiting 50 colonists, he traveled to the upper waters of the Ocmulgee River, where he recruited 1,000 Creek Indians to join the expedition against their traditional enemies.[18]\n On January 25, 1704, Moore's force arrived at Ayubale, one of the larger mission towns in Apalachee.  While most of the Creeks raided the surrounding villages, Moore took most of the whites and 15 Creek into Ayubale itself around 7:00\u00a0am.  The only resistance was organized by Father Angel Miranda, who retreated into the town's church compound, which was surrounded by a mud wall.  With 26 men he successfully held the English at bay for nine hours, and only surrendered himself, his men, and 58 women and children after they ran out of arrows.[18] According to one Spanish account, Miranda threw himself and his followers on Moore's mercy.  He was, according to this account (but apparently not others; see below) then summarily slain in cold blood by Moore's Indian allies, and some of his followers were then tortured and killed.[20]\n Word of the attack reached San Luis de Apalachee, eight leagues (about 24 miles (39\u00a0km)) south of Ayubale, where Captain Juan Ru\u00edz de Mex\u00eda raised a force of 400 Apalachee and 30 Spanish cavalry.[19][20] This force engaged Moore's at Ayubale, and was decisively defeated.  More than 200 Apalachees were killed or captured, three Spaniards were killed and eight were captured, with Mex\u00eda among the captured.  There is evidence that as many as 50 Apalachee joined with the English against the Spanish-led forces in this encounter.[2] Moore considered making an attack on the fort at San Luis, but his force had suffered a significant number of wounds, so he opted instead for an attempt at extortion.  Some of the Spanish prisoners managed to escape, so he released Miranda, Mex\u00eda and others to go to San Luis with the hope that the San Luis garrison commander would then pay a ransom for them.[21] However, the garrison commander refused to pay.[2]\n Following the battle at Ayubale, Moore continued his march through Apalachee.  One village, San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco, survived when its leader surrendered his church's gold ornaments and a train of supplies.[2] Moore moved slowly, since many of the Apalachee apparently wanted to leave with the English.  According to his report, most of the population of seven villages joined his march voluntarily.[22]\n In Moore's report of the expedition he claimed to have killed more than 1,100 men, women, and children.  He also stated that he \"removed into exile\" 300 and \"captured as slaves\" more than 4,300 people, mostly women and children.[23] The only major missions to survive in Apalachee were San Luis and San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco.  The Spanish at first attempted to fortify these places, but they were eventually judged to be indefensible and abandoned.  The survivors were consolidated at Abosaya, east of San Francisco de Potano.[24][25][26]\n James Moore did not identify by name the places his force destroyed.  Historian Mark Boyd has analyzed English and Spanish sources documenting the missions and the effects of Moore's raid.  According to his analysis,[27] the following missions were the ones most likely to have been destroyed:\n Spanish authorities in St. Augustine and Pensacola mobilized their meager forces, but did not return to Ayubale until after Moore's force had clearly left the area.  They buried the Christian dead, many of whom they reported as exhibiting evidence of torture.[21]  Despite the losses, they did not immediately abandon or consolidate the missions until further raiding took place, after which the demoralized surviving Apalachee insisted they would either retreat to Pensacola or go over to the English.[28]\n In the wake of Moore's raids, further raids were made into northern Florida, principally executed by the Creeks.  In August 1704, Creeks destroyed the Yustagan missions of San Pedro and San Mateo; a year later they attacked the Apalachee at Abosaya.  Further attacks against Abosaya the next month prompted the survivors to flee to St. Augustine.  In the spring of 1706, Creek raiders besieged San Francisco de Potano and attacked the La Chua ranch near Abosaya; both of these were abandoned, and Timucua was virtually depopulated by May 1706.[25] According to Apalachee scholar John Hann, between Moore's raids and these later ones, 2,000 Indians went into exile, and an unknown number were enslaved.[29] The French governor of Mobile, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, wrote that raiding the Florida area resulted in the killing of 2,000 Apalachees and the capture 32 Spaniards, 17 of whom were burned alive.[29] By the end of 1706 the Spanish presence in Florida had been reduced to St. Augustine and Pensacola.[30]\n \u2014 James Moore's report[31]\n Many survivors fled westward and settled near the French colonial outpost of Mobile, while others ended up near either St. Augustine or Pensacola;[22] Bienville reported that about 600 refugees were settled near Mobile.[29] The Apalachees taken by Moore were resettled either along the Savannah River, or among the Creek on the Ocmulgee River.[32] The free Apalachee refugees that settled these areas were frequently harassed by slavers; in some cases Indians taken as slaves were freed after protests were made to Carolina authorities.[33]\n The Spanish responded to the raids by encouraging privateering raids against Carolina coastal plantations.  In the following years, the English colonists continued to make inroads against Spanish and French interests in Florida and on the Gulf Coast, but they were never able to capture St. Augustine, Pensacola, or Mobile, the main Spanish and French settlements.  Pensacola was twice besieged by Creek forces in 1707, apparently with English colonial support.[34] English-supplied Indians also made incursions into French-dominated territories to the west, but English intentions to assault Mobile never got beyond the planning stages; there was a raid on an Indian village near Mobile in 1709.[35]\n Due in part to the somewhat fragmentary, unclear, and contradictory primary materials about these raids, historians have at times written widely varying accounts of the number of Indians that were enslaved.  Although Moore claimed in his report that a large number of Apalachee were enslaved, modern historians believe that a significant number of those resettled by Moore went voluntarily, and were not actually slaves. Vernon Crane, in The Southern Frontier, 1670\u20131732 (originally published in 1929), uncritically accepts Moore's numbers,[31] and 19th century South Carolina historian Edward McCrady only mentions 1,400 Apalachees being taken, of whom only 100 were slaves.[36] Historian Allan Gallay, in a modern analysis, opines that the raids in 1704 alone resulted in the enslavement of between 2,000 and 4,000 Indians.[30]\n Opinions also differ as to the long-term fate of the Indians that voluntarily went with Moore.  Since a 1715 census of the Savannah River settlements counted fewer than 650 Apalachees, Allan Gallay believes that the balance were probably sold into slavery.[30] James Covington believes that a combination of factors was to blame: in addition to active slaving against those settlements, disease, starvation, intermarriage with other tribes, and migration to other communities account for the difference.[37]\n \n", " The Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas is a Grade II Listed building in Toxteth, Liverpool, situated at the junction of Berkley Street and Princes Road.

The village is located along National Road Nr. 79, which goes from Warsaw to Bytom. Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 lies near the confluence of the Radomka and Vistula rivers at the border of Puszcza Stromecka wilderness.[1] The name of the village probably comes from two Polish words - ryczy (bellow) and w\u00f3\u0142 (ox), and comes from herds of cattle, which used to be moved through Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 on the way from Red Ruthenia towards the west.\n Jan D\u0142ugosz wrote that in the 13th century Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 already had St. Catherine parish church. In the 14th century, the village belonged to Polish kings, and a royal court was located here. In 1407 it was the seat of a starosta, located in Sandomierz Voivodeship, and two years later Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 was granted town rights by King W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o. The town, which in the 15th and 16th centuries belonged to several private owners, was famous in the region for a bridge on the Radomka river. Merchants had to pay a toll to cross it. In 1655 during the Swedish invasion of Poland, Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 was destroyed by the Swedes and never regained its importance. In the 18th centuries, Jews started to settle there, and in 1813 whole town was moved some 2,5 kilometers from its original location. This was due to frequent floods of the Radomka and the Vistula. In 1869 the government of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland stripped Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 of its town charter. On September 15, 1939, a battle between the Wehrmacht and Polish units of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army took place here. Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 was completely destroyed in 1944, during Soviet - German fighting at Warka- Magnuszew bridgehead (see Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive). In 1968-1979, the Kozienice Power Station was built nearby.\n At the beginning of World War II, most of the village was burned down by the invading German army, forcing the inhabitants to scatter throughout neighboring villages. In June 1940 there was an outbreak of typhus. The Jewish community of Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 consisted of 160 people. In early 1942 a small ghetto was set up there within the ghettoization process of the entire Radom-Land ordered by Kreishauptmann Friedrich Egen. In August of that year, 160 Jews were sent to Kozienice ghetto and in September, to Treblinka extermination camp, while 69 Jews went to Sobibor on August 4, 1942.[2]\n Radomka river near Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142\n Site of Jewish cemetery from before the war\n  Media related to Jewish cemetery in Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142 (Masovian Voivodeship) at Wikimedia Commons\n", " Lea Hernandez (born March 11, 1964) is an American comic book and webcomic creator, known primarily for working in a manga-influenced style,[1] and for doing lettering and touch-ups on manga imports.[2] She is the co-creator of Killer Princesses, written by Gail Simone and published by Oni Press; and the creator of Rumble Girls  from NBM Publishing.\n She did art for comics published by Marvel Comics and DC Comics: Marvel Mangaverse: Punisher (a one-shot), and Transmetropolitan  (two two-page shorts).

The film was released to Philippine theaters on August 22, 2007. It stars Isabel Granada, Paolo Ballesteros and Rafael Nanquil. The film gives a glimpse of the power struggle for the planet Xenoa. When the ruler of the triple-star system, Queen La\u2019ian (Clem Poblete) gives birth to the heirs of the Xenoan throne, she decides to protect them from the scheming General Norak (Ronnie Martinez) by sending the triplets \u2013 Eli, Zeus and Drix (played by Granada, Ballesteros and Nanquil respectively) \u2013 to faraway Earth.[1]\n The film was released under the tagline \"Three siblings. Two worlds. One empire.\"[2]\n The ruler of Xenoa, Queen La'ian, gives birth to the heirs of her throne: Eli, Zeus, and Drix. She decides to protect her triplets from the scheming leader of rival world Zephyr, General Norak, by sending her children to faraway Earth. Two decades later, the lives of the three estranged siblings intersect in the most unexpected way. Everything they know and love is suddenly threatened when General Norak zeroes in on them from light years away. The spiteful alien wants unconditional, uncontested power over Xenoa, but he is unable to achieve this as long as the true heirs to the throne are still alive. He is so hellbent on ruling Xenoa that he does not think twice about turning sibling against sibling in his quest for power.[3]\n [4]\n Sean Lim, director and writer of the film, admitted that Xenoa is his first film, although he has co-directed a Big Foot production shot in Hong Kong. He tells that the film is about hybrid human beings from another planet called \"Xenoa\". Lim admits to having a longtime crush on Isabel Granada. According to him, he specifically cast Isabel for the role because of her almond-shaped eyes, making her perfect for the role of a hybrid human named Eli. Her character is described as a na\u00efve yet undeniably gorgeous woman. She is trusting and generous to a fault. Eli grows up in an orphanage house managed by nuns.[5] Granada was supposed to play as the Queen. When director Lim saw her, he re-cast her as one of the triplets since she was too young to play the queen. Xenoa is considered to be Granada's comeback film, since her last movie was still in 2001 which was Halik ng Sirena.[6]\n Xenoa\u2019s world premiere happened on August 14, 2007 at 7 p.m. at SM Megamall Cinema 1, Ortigas Center. Regular showing dates were from August 22 up to 28, 2007 at all SM Cinemas nationwide.[7]\n \"Collide\" is the official soundtrack single for Xenoa. It was the only song used for the promotion of the film. The song was performed and recorded by Filipino singer Nina. In October 2007, the song was included on her re-issued album Nina Featuring the Hits of Barry Manilow. It was also nominated for Best Song Written for Movie/TV/Stage Play on the 2008 Awit Awards.[8]\n On October 22, 2007, the song was made available on digital download through iTunes.[9]\n The music video for \"Collide\" was also directed by the film's director, Sean Lim.

It was founded in 852 by Duke Liudolf of Saxony, progenitor of the Liudolfing or Ottonian dynasty, whose rich endowments ensured its stability and prosperity.\n The \"Imperial free secular foundation of Gandersheim\" (Kaiserlich freies weltliches Reichsstift Gandersheim), as it was officially known from the 13th century to its dissolution in 1810, was a community of the unmarried daughters of the high nobility, leading a godly life but not under monastic vows, which is the meaning of the word \"secular\" in the title.\n In the collegiate church the original Romanesque church building is still visible, with Gothic extensions. It is a cruciform basilica with two towers on the westwork, consisting of a flat-roofed nave  and two vaulted side-aisles. The transept has a square crossing with more or less square arms, with a square choir to the east. Beneath the crossing choir is a hall-crypt. The westwork consist of two towers and a connecting two-storey block; it originally had in addition a projecting entrance hall, also on two storeys, the \"paradise\". The present church building, which has been subject to restoration in the 19th and 20th centuries, was begun in about 1100 and dedicated in 1168. Remains of the previous building are incorporated into the present structure.\n Gandersheim Abbey was a proprietary foundation by Duke Liudolf of Saxony and his wife Oda, who during a pilgrimage to Rome in 846[citation needed] obtained the permission of Pope Sergius II for the new establishment and also the relics of the sainted former popes Anastasius and Innocent,[2] who are still the patron saints of the abbey church. The community settled first at Brunshausen (Brunistishusun[3]). The first abbess was Hathumod, a daughter of Liudolf, as were the two succeeding abbesses. In 856 construction began on the church at Gandersheim and in 881 Bishop Wigbert dedicated it to the Saints Anastasius, Innocent and John the Baptist, after which the community moved in.\n Already in 877 King Louis the Younger placed the abbey under the protection of the Empire, which gave it extensive independence. In 919 King Henry I granted it Imperial immediacy. The close connection to the Empire meant that the abbey was obliged to provide accommodation to the German kings on their travels, and numerous royal visits are recorded.\n The establishment of the abbey by the founder of the Liudolfingers gave it especial importance during the Ottonian period. Until the foundation of Quedlinburg Abbey in 936, Gandersheim was among the most important Ottonian family institutions, and its church was one of the Ottonian burial places.\n The canonesses, commonly known as Stiftsdamen, were allowed private property and, as they had taken no vows, were free at any time to leave the abbey. The Ottonian and Salian kings and their entourages often stayed in Gandersheim, and the canonesses were by no means remote from the world. Apart from the memorial Masses for the founding family, one of the main duties of the canonesses was the education of the daughters of the nobility (who were not obliged to become canonesses themselves).\n One of the abbey's best-known canonesses was Roswitha of Gandersheim, famous as the first female German language poet. During a period of approximately 20 years \u2013 from about 950 to 970 or so \u2013 she wrote historical poetry, spiritual pieces and dramas, and the Gesta Ottonis, expressing her veneration of Otto I.\n In the Great Gandersheim Conflict, as it is called, originating from the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries, the Bishop of Hildesheim asserted claims over the abbey and its estates, which were located in an area where the boundaries between the Bishopric of Hildesheim and the Archbishop of Mainz were unclear. The pressure from Hildesheim moved the abbey increasingly into the sphere of Mainz. The situation was only eventually resolved by a privilege of Pope Innocent III of 22 June 1206 freeing the abbey once and for all from all claims of Hildesheim, and granting the abbesses the title of Imperial princesses (Reichsf\u00fcrstinnen).\n With the death of the last Salian king in 1125 the importance of the abbey began to diminish and it came more and more under the influence of the local territorial rulers. The Welfs in particular attempted to gain control over the abbey, until its dissolution. The abbeys were not able to establish their own territorial lordship. No later than the mid-1270s, the Dukes of Brunswick succeeded in obtaining the Vogtei of the abbey and in the late 13th century built a castle in Gandersheim. Another way to gain influence over the abbey was to place relatives in the abbess's chair. This took the Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg rather longer to achieve, but they were at last successful in 1402 with the election of their first family abbess, Sophia III, Princess of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg.\n The Reformation was first introduced into the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel in 1542 when troops of the Schmalkaldic League occupied it. The Reformers ignored the abbey's Imperial immediacy and ordained the use of Lutheran church services, the introduction of which however the canonesses were able to postpone on account of the absence of the prioress (Dekanin) who was governing the abbey on behalf of the seven-year-old abbess. The townspeople of Gandersheim had received the Reformation enthusiastically and on 13 July 1543 undertook an iconoclastic attack on the abbey church, where they destroyed images and altars. Henry V changed his mind however and the principality changed back to Roman Catholicism. He made good at least some of the damages, and the church was re-dedicated.\n In 1568 the Reformation was finally implemented under Julius, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. The abbey and its dependencies at Brunshausen and Clus became Lutheran, and the Marienkloster and the Franciscan friaries were suppressed. A period now began of conflict between the abbess and the duke as both tried to extend their spheres of influence, a conflict which was not settled until 1593 when a treaty finally settled the points of disagreement.\n Under the abbesses Henriette Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel and Elisabeth Ernestine of Saxe-Meiningen there began a new golden age of the abbey. The abbesses promoted arts and sciences. Elisabeth Ernestine Antonie had the summer castle at Brunshausen[4] built, as well as the Baroque wing of the abbey with the Kaisers' Hall (Kaisersaal), and she refurbished the church.[5]\n In 1802, faced with imminent secularisation, the abbey surrendered its Imperial immediacy to the sovereignty of the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, thus ending the centuries-long struggle with the Welfs.\n During the French occupation Gandersheim belonged to the Kingdom of Westphalia. The abbess, who had fled, was permitted by Napoleon to return to the abbey and to live there until her death on 10 March 1810, after which there were no further elections for a successor. The abbey was dissolved and its assets were taken by the Westphalian crown, with the remaining occupants pensioned off.\n Even after the end of the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1813 the Duchy of Brunswick did not restore the abbey.\n The abbey is now used by the Evangelical-Lutheran parochial group of St. Anastasius and St. Innocent. During restoration works in 1997 there came to light some of the old church treasure: relics, textiles and reliquaries. These have been on display since March 2006.\n [7]\n Coordinates: 51\u00b052\u203213\u2033N 10\u00b001\u203234\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.870397\u00b0N 10.026097\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.870397; 10.026097\n", " \n Empis soror is a species of flies in the family Empididae.

Psychologists are interested in why we may fear spiders and physiologists may be interested in the input/output system of the amygdala. A psychophysiologist will attempt to link the two. Psychophysiologists generally study the psychological/physiological link in intact human subjects. While early psychophysiologists almost always examined the impact of psychological states on physiological system responses, since the 1970s, psychophysiologists also frequently study the impact of physiological states and systems on psychological states and processes. It is this perspective of studying the interface of mind and body that makes psychophysiologists most distinct.\n Historically, most psychophysiologists tended to examine the physiological responses and organ systems innervated by the autonomic nervous system. More recently, psychophysiologists have been equally, or potentially more, interested in the central nervous system, exploring cortical brain potentials such as the many types of event-related potentials (ERPs), brain waves, and utilizing advanced technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), MRI, PET, MEG, and other neuroimagery techniques.\n Continuing the comparison between a psychophysiologist and a physiological psychologist, a psychophysiologist may look at how exposure to a stressful situation will produce a result in the cardiovascular system such as a change in heart rate (HR), vasodilation/vasoconstriction, myocardial contractility, or stroke volume. A physiological psychologist may look at how one cardiovascular event may influence another cardiovascular or endocrine event, or how activation of one neural brain structure exerts excitatory activity in another neural structure which then induces an inhibitory effect in some other system. Often, physiological psychologists examine the effects that they study in infrahuman subjects using surgical or invasive techniques and processes.\n Psychophysiology is closely related to the field of neuroscience and social neuroscience, which primarily concerns itself with relationships between psychological events and brain responses. Psychophysiology is also related to the medical discipline known as psychosomatics.\n While psychophysiology was a discipline off the mainstream of psychological and medical science prior to roughly the 1960 and 1970s, more recently, psychophysiology has found itself positioned at the intersection of psychological and medical science, and its popularity and importance have expanded commensurately with the realization of the inter-relatedness of mind and body.\n Psychophysiology measures exist in three domains; reports, readings, and behavior.[2] Evaluative reports involve participant introspection and self-ratings of internal psychological states or physiological sensations, such as self-report of arousal levels on the self-assessment manikin,[3] or measures of interoceptive visceral awareness such as heartbeat detection.[4] Merits to self-report are an emphasis on accurately understand the participants' subjective experience and understanding their perception; however, its pitfalls include the possibility of participants misunderstanding a scale or incorrectly recalling events.[5] Physiological responses also can be measured via instruments that read bodily events such as heart rate change, electrodermal activity (EDA), muscle tension, and cardiac output. Many indices are part of modern psychophysiology, including brain waves (electroencephalography, EEG), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), electrodermal activity (a standardized term encompassing skin conductance response, SCR, and galvanic skin response, GSR), cardiovascular measures (heart rate, HR; beats per minute, BPM; heart rate variability, HRV; vasomotor activity), muscle activity (electromyography, EMG), electrogastrogram (EGG) changes in pupil diameter with thought and emotion (pupillometry),  eye movements, recorded via the electro-oculogram (EOG) and direction-of-gaze methods, and cardiodynamics, recorded via impedance cardiography. These measures are beneficial because they provide accurate and perceiver-independent objective data recorded by machinery.[2]  The downsides, however, are that any physical activity or motion can alter responses, and basal levels of arousal and responsiveness can differ among individuals and even between situations.[6]\n Finally, one can measure overt action or behavior, which involves the observation and recording actual actions, such as running, freezing, eye movement, and facial expression. These are good response measures and easy to record in animals, but they are not as frequently used in human studies.[2]\n Psychophysiological measures are often used to study emotion and attention responses to stimuli, during exertion, and increasingly, to better understand cognitive processes.\nPhysiological sensors have been used to detect emotions in schools[7] and intelligent tutoring systems.[8]\n It has long been recognized that emotional episodes are partly constituted by physiological responses.[9] Early work done linking emotions to psychophysiology started with research on mapping consistent autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to discrete emotional states. For example, anger might be constituted by a certain set of physiological responses, such as increased cardiac output and high diastolic blood pressure, which would allow us to better understand patterns and predict emotional responses. Some studies were able to detect consistent patterns of ANS responses that corresponded to specific emotions under certain contexts, like an early study by Paul Ekman and colleagues in 1983 \"Emotion-specific activity in the autonomic nervous system was generated by constructing facial prototypes of emotion muscle by muscle and by reliving past emotional experiences. The autonomic activity produced distinguished not only between positive and negative emotions, but also among negative emotions\".[10] \nHowever, as more studies were conducted, more variability was found in ANS responses to discrete emotion inductions, not only among individuals but also over time in the same individuals, and greatly between social groups.[11] Some of these differences can be attributed to variables like induction technique, context of the study, or classification of stimuli, which can alter a perceived scenario or emotional response. However it was also found that features of the participant could also alter ANS responses. Factors such as basal level of arousal at the time of experimentation or between test recovery, learned or conditioned responses to certain stimuli, range and maximal level of effect of ANS action, and individual attentiveness can all alter physiological responses in a lab setting.[12] Even supposedly discrete emotional states fail to show specificity. For example, some emotional typologists consider fear to have subtypes, which might involve fleeing or freezing, both of which can have distinct physiological patterns and potentially distinct neural circuitry.[13] As such no definitive correlation can be drawn linking specific autonomic patterns to discrete emotions, causing emotion theorists to rethink classical definitions of emotions.\n Physiological computing represents a category of affective computing that incorporates real-time software adaption to the psychophysiological activity of the user.  The main goal of this is to build a computer that responds to user emotion, cognition and motivation.  The approach is to enable implicit and symmetrical human-computer communication by granting the software access to a representation of the user's psychological status.\n There are several possible methods to represent the psychological state of the user (discussed in the affective computing page). The advantages of using psychophysiological indices are that their changes are continuous, measures are covert and implicit, and only available data source when the user interacts with the computer without any explicit communication or input device.  These systems rely upon an assumption that the psychophysiological measure is an accurate one-to-one representation of a relevant psychological dimension such as mental effort, task engagement and frustration.\n Physiological computing systems all contain an element that may be termed as an adaptive controller that may be used to represent the player.  This adaptive controller represents the decision-making process underlying software adaptation.  In their simplest form, adaptive controllers are expressed in Boolean statements.  Adaptive controllers encompass not only the decision-making rules, but also the psychophysiological inference that is implicit in the quantification of those trigger points used to activate the rules.  The representation of the player using an adaptive controller can become very complex and often only one-dimensional. The loop used to describe this process is known as the biocybernetic loop.  The biocybernetic loop describes the closed loop system that receives psychophysiological data from the player, transforms that data into a computerized response, which then shapes the future psychophysiological response from the player.  A positive control loop tends towards instability as player-software loop strives towards a higher standard of desirable performance.  The physiological computer game may wish to incorporate both positive and negative loops into the adaptive controller.[14]\n A. Weissman, M. Aranovitch, S. Blazer, and E. Z.

Their crew numbered 240 officers and enlisted men. The ships measured 118.5 meters (388\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) overall, with a beam of 10.8 meters (35\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) and a draft of 3.76 meters (12\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in).[1] They displaced 2,065 metric tons (2,032 long tons) at standard load and 2,529 metric tons (2,489 long tons) at deep load.[2] The ships had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of 52,000 shaft horsepower (39,000\u00a0kW) for a designed speed of 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph). The ships had a range of 5,000 nautical miles (9,300\u00a0km; 5,800\u00a0mi) at a speed of 18 knots (33\u00a0km/h; 21\u00a0mph).[3]\n The main armament of the Kager\u014d class consisted of six Type 3 127-millimeter (5.0\u00a0in) guns in three twin-gun turrets, one superfiring pair aft and one turret forward of the superstructure. They were built with four Type 96 25-millimeter (1.0\u00a0in) anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but more of these guns were added over the course of the war. The ships were also armed with eight 610-millimeter (24.0\u00a0in) torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 \"Long Lance\" torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube.[2] Their anti-submarine weapons comprised 16 depth charges.[3]\n Hamakaze was heavily involved in the fighting in 1943 in the Solomon Islands chain, including the battles of Kula Gulf, Kolombangara, and the 'Battle off Horaniu'.  On 7 April 1945, Hamakaze escorted the battleship Yamato from the Inland Sea on her Operation Ten-Go attack on the Allied forces on Okinawa.

The team signed two players prior to the official announcement of the team in Noora R\u00e4ty and forward Kelli Stack.[2] Red Star announced Digit Murphy, formerly of the Boston Blades as head coach.[3] The team also signed Rob Morgan from Yale as associate head coach[4] but soon after became the head coach of the second Chinese team, the Vanke Rays.\n With their first round pick in the 2017 CWHL Draft, the Red Star selected Noora R\u00e4ty.[5] The club proceeded to select Alexandra Carpenter in the second round,[6] while the third round saw the franchise select from NWHL All-Star Shiann Darkangelo.\n On October 21, 2017, the Red Star competed in their first game, facing the Markham Thunder. Kelli Stack and Baiwei Yu both earned assists on the first goal in Kunlun Red Star history scored by Zoe Hickel.[7] During the regular season, teams that traveled to China played a three-game series against the Red Star in an effort to reduce travel costs.\n By season's end, Noora R\u00e4ty was the CWHL's regular season goaltending champion, leading the league in goals against average. In addition, she tied for the league in shutouts with goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer of Les Canadiennes, with six. R\u00e4ty also won the CWHL Goaltender of the Year award, the first European-born goaltender to capture the honor, and Kelli Stack led the CWHL in scoring, the first American-born player to win the Angela James Bowl.\n R\u00e4ty was also the starting goaltender for the Red Star in the 2018 Clarkson Cup finals in Toronto. Facing the Markham Thunder, the final went into overtime, where Laura Stacey scored with 2:11 left in the 4-on-4 overtime as Markham prevailed by a 2\u20131 score for its first Clarkson Cup win.[8] R\u00e4ty recorded 37 saves in the game while Stack scored the only goal of the game for the Red Star.[9] Head coach Digit Murphy left the team in May and Kunlun Red Star named Bob Deraney, formerly the head coach of the Providence Friars women's ice hockey team, as the new head coach on June 12, 2018.[10]\n Prior to the 2018\u201319 season, the CWHL shut down the other Chinese team, the Vanke Rays. On August 3, 2018, Kunlun Red Star changed its name to Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays. Rob Morgan, who served as the head coach of the Vanke Rays during its only season was named as the general manager for the consolidated club. Kunlun Red Star brand was continued to be used by a separate hockey team for the Chinese national players as part of the national team's development in preparation for the 2022 Olympics.[11]\n In February 2019, the KRS Vanke Rays announced coach Deraney had stepped down and Mike LaZazzera would take over the rest of the season.[12] The team missed qualifying for the final playoff spot via tiebreaker with the Toronto Furies.\n The CWHL ceased operations at the end of the season and the status of the professional Chinese women's team has not been given.\n As of September 15, 2018[13]\n", " \n Leucanopsis potamia is a moth of the family Erebidae.

The spacecraft would be assembled in Earth orbit as part of a larger project preceded by interstellar probes and telescopic observation of target star systems. The rest of the spacecraft would be attached behind the ball as a seamless metallic fuel tank. The proposed method of tank construction would be to expand a plastic balloon in space and coat it with metal.\n The spacecraft would be modular, and the main living area would be three identical 300 feet (91\u00a0m) wide and long cylindrical modules.[3] The Enzmann could function as an interstellar ark, supporting a crew of 200 but with space for expansion.[1]\n The Enzmann starship was detailed in the October 1973 issue of Analog, with a cover by space artist Rick Sternbach.[4] The spacecraft described in that issue had some differences compared to the 1960s proposal, such as using a 12,000,000 ton (11,000,000 tonnes) ball of frozen deuterium. Enzmanns have been depicted by many space artists including Don Dixon, David A. Hardy, Syd Mead, Bob Eggleton, and Rick Sternbach.\n Sources conflict about the projected speed, perhaps 30% of the speed of light, c, but 9% may be more likely. At 30%, relativistic effects between people on Earth and on the spacecraft, such as time dilation would become more noticeable, such as the shipboard time being less than the Earth observed time.\n Overall specifications have varied somewhat, but the design has nuclear pulse engines at the rear, then cylinders for human habitation, then closer the front a large ball of fuel.[5] Early versions were said to have 8 engines and later 24 nuclear rocket engines, which would be powered by the fusing of deuterium into Helium three.[6]  A common feature was that the crew area was replicated 3 times for redundancy, and a common core pillar ran the length of the spacecraft and through the center of each habitation unit.[7]\n Balloon satellite under test.

The film was directed by Gerald Thomas, and stars Michael Craig, Anne Helm, Jeff Donnell and Alan Hale, Jr. There are minor roles for Carry On stalwarts Jim Dale and Joan Sims, and the veteran actor Sam Kydd also appears with his then six-year-old son Jonathan Kydd. The film was widely perceived as an attempt to repeat the success of the film Genevieve, with traction engines in place of vintage cars.\n Jack Hopkins (played by Michael Craig) is an aircraft designer with a passion for traction engines and he owns one called The Iron Maiden. His boss (played by Cecil Parker) is eager to sell a new supersonic jet aircraft (actually an RAF Handley Page Victor bomber) that Jack has designed to American millionaire Paul Fisher (Alan Hale, Jr.). The first encounter between Fisher and Jack goes badly, and tensions only heighten after Fisher's daughter Kathy (Anne Helm) damages The Iron Maiden, rendering it impossible to be driven solo. Jack is desperate to enter the annual Woburn Abbey steam rally with the machine, but his fireman is injured (Sam Kydd breaks his leg by falling over his son's roller skate) and unable to participate. When all seems lost, the millionaire himself is won over by Jack's plight and joins him in driving the engine, and the two soon become firm friends.\n After an eventful journey, Fisher and Jack reach Woburn Abbey and enter the rally, only for Fisher to injure his back at the last minute. When all seems lost, the sceptical Kathy appears and joins Jack in the engine. The two pilot The Iron Maiden from last place to first, winning the rally; at the finish line, Jack and Kathy embrace and kiss, while The Iron Maiden boils over and explodes. The engine is memorialised when Jack's new jet is named after it.\n A Handley Page Victor military bomber is featured in the film as Jack Hopkins' supersonic jetliner. A number of sequences show a Victor in close-up, taxiing, taking off, climbing, flying past and landing with drogue parachute deployed. These scenes were filmed at Radlett Aerodrome.\n The traction engine that featured as The Iron Maiden was a John Fowler & Co. 7\u00a0nhp showman's road locomotive (works no. 15657, reg no. FX\u00a06661). She was built in September 1920 as a class R3 road locomotive for heavy haulage work and saw many years' service on the Isle of Portland, hauling blocks of stone from the quarries to the harbour.[1]\n She returned to Fowler's works for conversion into a showman's engine, which entailed the addition of a dynamo bracket in front of the chimney, and a full-length canopy, among other things. Once converted she was based in Alfreton, Derbyshire, and undertook fairground work, until bought for preservation in 1952. From new she was named Kitchener \u2013 until the film was made, whereupon she was renamed The Iron Maiden.[2]\n The engine was first owned during restoration by John Crawley, the man behind its use in the production of the film. It was then sold to George Hawkins, before passing into the Dr Tony Marchington collection in Derbyshire, following its sale at the 1993 Great Dorset Steam Fair and became part of the same collection as Flying Scotsman. The Iron Maiden is today owned by Graeme Atkinson, who displays the engine alongside a collection of other engines and fair organs as part of the Scarborough Fair Collection, at his holiday park in Lebberston, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The engine was featured on the cover of the Official Programme for the 38th Great Dorset Steam Fair, in 2006, and continues to make regular appearances at that event.\n It has also made at least one appearance at the Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington near York to be photographed next to the Handley Page Victor belonging to Andre Tempest that is preserved there.\n", " Coordinates: 34\u00b021\u203231.27\u2033N 109\u00b012\u203237.75\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.3586861\u00b0N 109.2104861\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.3586861; 109.2104861\n Mount Li (simplified Chinese: \u9a8a\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u9a6a\u5c71; pinyin: L\u00ed Sh\u0101n) is a mountain located in the northeast of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province, China.[1] The mountain is part of the Qinling mountain range and rises to a height of 1302 metres above sea level. It is one of the eight scenic spots of the Guanzhong Plain and popularly said to \"shine like a beacon in the evening sunlight\".\n Some ancient tales say that the literal Chinese name \"Black Steed Mountain\" stems from its resemblance to a horse whilst others that the name arose during the Shang and Zhou Dynasties because the \"Black Steed Tribe\", lived in this area. Another legend cites the mountain as the place from where the Mount Li goddess Lishan Laomu and N\u00fcwa, creator of mankind, repaired the wall of heaven. The two goddess has long been worshipped on the same mountain.\n In 771 BCE, King You of Zhou was slain at its foothills alongside his loyal vassal Huan of Zheng. This marked the collapse of the mighty Western Zhou dynasty and began a very long age of endless conflict that devastated the Central Plains.\n At the foot of the mountain is the necropolis of the first Emperor Qin Shi Huang, comprising his mausoleum and the Terracotta Army.\n Huaqing Pool, a Tang Dynasty hot spring complex, stands at the foot of Mount Li.\n In 1936, Kuomintang (KMT) leader Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Shaanxi Province and stayed at Huaqingchi. His ostensible mission was to eradicate the local Communists and warlords but instead he was kidnapped whilst hiding in a crevice on Li Mountain in what became known as the Xi'an Incident. After the incident, the KMT government built the simple \"Minzu Fuxing Pavilion\" (\u6c11\u65cf\u590d\u5174\u4ead) at the foot of the crevice in commemoration.\n The building was reconstructed using steel and concrete in 1946 with the relevant funds subscribed by students of the Whampoa Military Academy in Guangdong. It was renamed the \"Zhengqi Pavilion\" (\u6b63\u6c14\u4ead) with inscriptions in the building eulogizing Chiang authored by senior KMT officers.\n After the 1949 Communist victory, the pavilion was for a time called the \"Seizing Chiang Pavilion\" (\u6349\u848b\u4ead), finally adopting its current name of \"Bingjian Pavilion\" (\u5175\u8c0f\u4ead; literally \"stern advice backed by force\") in 1986.

He was appointed Prebendary of Chichester Cathedral in 1959.[4] In 1961, he was consecrated a bishop and appointed Bishop of Whitby, a suffragan bishop in the Diocese of York.[4]\n Snow was a prolific author: amongst others he wrote A Guide to Prayer (1932), A School Service Book (1936), Into His Presence (1946), The Public School in the New Age (1959), and Forth in His Name (1964).[4] He continued in retirement to chair The National Society.\n He was the son of First World War General Sir Thomas D'Oyly Snow.

They are located in Kensington, Battersea, Clapham and Fulham, as well as a kindergarten in Battersea.[1] They are a family-run establishment, and have come to be seen as a feeder for major British public schools such as Alleyn's School, Harrow, Eton, Marlborough, Dulwich, City of London, Radley, King's College School, and Westminster.[2]\n Current:\n Former:\n Thomas's was founded in 1971 when Joanna Thomas, an actress and mother of three young children, started the Ranelagh Kindergarten in a Pimlico church hall (now Thomas's Kindergarten, Pimlico). Six years later, the success of the Kindergarten and the strong demand for London day schools of quality encouraged David Thomas, a former Gurkha Regiment Officer, to join his wife in founding a school for older children. Following the acquisition of a building in Cadogan Gardens in 1977, the \"Kensington Court Lower School\" came into being with two teachers and eleven pupils. In less than four years the school, now named \"Thomas's\", had over two hundred children. Demand for places continued to increase and, in response to this, Thomas's expanded in 1981 into two buildings in Cottesmore Gardens, just south of Kensington Gardens, to create Thomas's, Kensington.\n By the end of 1989 the Preparatory School at Cadogan Gardens needed more space and in August 1990 the freehold was acquired of the former Sir Walter St John's Grammar School in Battersea. The school, which became Thomas's, Battersea, moved to its extensive new premises in October 1990 and the leasehold buildings in Cadogan Gardens were sold. In September 1992 Thomas's Kindergarten, Battersea was started in the crypt of St Mary's Church. At the end of 1992, with an increasing demand for places, the freehold was secured of the magnificent former Walsingham School, previously Clapham County Girls' School, in Broomwood Road and the new Thomas's, Clapham opened in September 1993.\n In September 1995, David and Joanna Thomas's two sons, Tobyn and Ben, were appointed Principals, having worked in the schools for a number of years. In June 1998, a charitable foundation was formed. The aims of the charity, Thomas's Schools Foundation, are to assist certain parents financially with the education of their children and to run local community projects. In 1999, David and Joanna Thomas retired from active management of the schools, which are now run by Tobyn and Ben. Ben is also Headmaster of Thomas's, Battersea. In 2000 and 2001, a \u00a34m construction programme was carried out to enhance the facilities at Thomas's, Clapham and Thomas's, Battersea. In 2002, an opportunity arose to improve Thomas's, Kensington through the acquisition of a nearby school, Lady Eden's. Lady Eden's was closed in Summer 2002 and its buildings converted to become the Lower School of Thomas's, Kensington. The existing buildings in Cottesmore Gardens were extensively refurbished and now house the Preparatory School. The premises of Thomas's, Kensington are freehold.\n In 2004, Thomas\u2019s acquired a long lease on the buildings formerly owned by the London Institute for the Chelsea College of Art and Design in Hugon Road, SW6.

The station also carries games for the Cleveland Indians, and Youngstown State Penguin football and basketball. The station recently signed a deal to carry Youngstown State football and basketball; they had previously carried Ohio State football and basketball, which has now been moved to 1390 WNIO and 106.1 WBBG and Cleveland Browns, which now has been moved to Sports Radio 1240 WBBW and Y103 WYFM.\n The station was founded in 1926 by Warren P. Williamson, Jr. (1900\u20131996). It is Youngstown's oldest continuing operating radio station, signing on the air on September 26, 1926 at 1400\u00a0kHz at 50 watts. The original facilities were in the basement of Williamson's home, but by the following year operations had moved to studios in the YMCA in downtown Youngstown. Ownership was organized in the name of the Radio Electric Service Co., and later WKBN Broadcasting Corporation. With the implementation of the FRC's General Order 40 on November 11, 1928 the station moved 570\u00a0kHz where it remains today.\n Shortly after WKBN's launch, the station became a charter affiliate of the nascent CBS Radio Network, an affiliation that would last until the end of the century. In the 1930s and 1940s, WKBN established a major presence in Youngstown as the city's CBS network affiliate, and for many years it was one of only two radio stations licensed to Youngstown (the other being WFMJ, now WNIO, which signed on in 1939). On February 8, 1943, Alan Freed started his early radio career on WKBN. Most importantly was broadcasting on Radio Luxembourg [1] to the troops abroad.\n Williamson started WKBN-FM in 1948, and for many years it transmitted the same programming as the AM station. The FM station is now WMXY. He also started WKBN-TV in 1953, which became a predominantly CBS-TV affiliate in part due to the AM station's long history with the radio network (WKBN-TV to this day has retained the CBS-TV affiliation).\n On January 22, 1999 the Williamsons sold WKBN and WKBN-FM to Jacor Communications, ending 73 years of family ownership. Jacor, however, did not own the stations very long. On April 29, 1999 Clear Channel Communications completed its $6.5 billion purchase of Jacor and its 454 stations, including WKBN and WKBN-FM. In September 2014, Clear Channel Communications became iHeartMedia, Inc.\n Coordinates: 40\u00b059\u203206\u2033N 80\u00b036\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff40.98500\u00b0N 80.60000\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.98500; -80.60000\n", " Social Security is a play by Andrew Bergman.\n It focuses on trendy Manhattan art gallery owners Barbara and David Kahn, whose life is upended when her Mineola housewife sister Trudy deposits their eccentric mother Sophie on the couple's doorstep while she and her husband Martin head to Buffalo to rescue their sexually precocious college student daughter from a menage a trois with two men. Barbara and David introduce Sophie to suave nonagenarian artist Maurice Koenig, who offers to paint her portrait and soon begins to brighten her life in ways she never expected in her twilight years.\n After twenty-six previews, the Broadway production, directed by Mike Nichols, opened on April 17, 1986 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it ran for 388 performances. The cast included Marlo Thomas as Barbara, Ron Silver as David, Joanna Gleason as Trudy, Olympia Dukakis as Sophie, Stefan Schnabel as Maurice, and Kenneth Welsh as Martin. Later in the run, Marilu Henner and Cliff Gorman assumed the roles of Barbara and David.

Viacom assumed control of the company as part of its acquisition of Paramount Pictures in 1994. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company acquired the company, and  although licensed through 2017, Cedar Fair dropped Paramount/CBS-licensed names from the parks due to poor sales and problems from poor solvency in January 2007.\n The company once owned and operated Paramount's Kings Island, Paramount's Kings Dominion, Paramount's Great America, Paramount's Carowinds, and Paramount Canada's Wonderland and managed Bonfante Gardens in Gilroy, California. From late 2001 until late 2004, Paramount Parks also managed Terra M\u00edtica, an amusement park in Benidorm, Valencia, Spain.\n Paramount Communications, previously known as Gulf+Western, in turn had acquired the parks from Nelson Schwab and his management group. Schwab and his KECO Entertainment acquired the group in a management-led LBO from the Taft Broadcasting Company, which had built Kings Island in Cincinnati using cast off rides from Cincinnati's Coney Island and to this day there is a small area in the Cincinnati park called \"Coney Island\" (Named \"Coney Mall\" in later years) still featuring some of those original rides.\n The parks were part of Viacom's Blockbuster Entertainment division until 2002 when they were moved back to Paramount Pictures. After another Viacom corporate shuffle in 2004 the parks became part of Viacom Recreation, a division of Nickelodeon and MTV Networks.\n On January 1, 2006, as Viacom went through a corporate split (creating a new version of Viacom and renaming the original company CBS Corporation), Paramount Parks was assigned to CBS Corporation. CBS Corporation, in order to \"toss overboard\" any unnecessary company assets, sought to sell the parks during the 2006 season, planning to continue their operation until a buyer was found. Cedar Fair Entertainment Co., owners of more well known Cedar Point and Knott's Berry Farm theme parks approached the company in 2006. They officially purchased the parks and a 10-year license, stating that the parks could continue to use the \"Paramount\" prefix and the titles of any Paramount movies effectively until 2017. However, after poor sales and problems from poor solvency, all references to Paramount/CBS-licensed properties were removed from the parks in 2007. The only references to a Viacom property remaining were the characters and titles used in Nickelodeon Universe (Kings Island) and Nickelodeon Central (Kings Dominion, Carowinds, Great America, and Canada's Wonderland), all of which were rethemed to the children's area utilized by Cedar Fair's own legacy parks, Peanuts for the 2010 season.\n In June 2007, it was revealed that a Paramount Park was to be developed and opened at the Dubailand complex (which itself is currently on hold) in the United Arab Emirates. No clear developments have been made, and it is likely the project has been abandoned.\n In October 2011, plans for a new Paramount theme park to be developed in Alhama, Murcia were revealed in Madrid. The resort to be called Paramount Park is to be the second-largest theme park in Europe after Disneyland, Paris. Projects to continue with the construction of the park have been scrapped.\n In December 2018, it was announced that Paramount Pictures signed a deal with Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment to install the first Paramount-branded theme park in Incheon, South Korea. It is slated to open in 2025, three years after Inspire Integrated Entertainment Resort's opening. Paramount and Daewoo Motor Sales previously announced in 2008 that it will build Paramount Movie Park Korea in Songdo near Incheon, but the plans was never announced due to financial problems of Daewoo Motor Sales. [1]\n The Paramount Parks were not built by Paramount, but rather were pre-existing and purchased as a whole, rebranded with the Paramount name. Effectively, it seemed Paramount was attempting to enter into the movie-based theme-park business popularized by amusement park and resort companies, such as Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Six Flags Theme Parks, Cedar Fair and Universal Parks & Resorts.\n In the 1970s and 1980s, Taft Broadcasting created a division called KECO Entertainment (King's Entertainment Company), which was formed in order to build theme parks nationwide.[citation needed]  In 1972 and 1975, KECO built Kings Island and Kings Dominion respectively. In 1975, KECO led a forced purchase on the Carowinds Corporation, a bankrupt company, leaving them no choice but to sell Carowinds theme park in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1981, KECO opened Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada.\n In 1984 hotel company Marriott, owner of two parks named Great America, was looking to divest itself of its parks. One of the parks was located in Silicon Valley in the exurbs of San Francisco and the other was located in the North Shore suburbs of Chicago. The California park was purchased by KECO, while the Illinois Park became part of the Six Flags chain.\n In 1992, after 22 years of great successful and thrill classic entertainment experience management, KECO Entertainment sold their six parks to Paramount Communications (which was later purchased by Viacom). Subsequently, in 1993, the \"Paramount's\" prefix was added to the parks, excluding Canada's Wonderland, which was renamed to \"Paramount Canada's Wonderland\", to avoid the use of a double possessive noun. Thus, the first five parks of the Paramount Parks were established: Paramount's Kings Island, Paramount's Kings Dominion, Paramount's Great America, Paramount's Carowinds, and Paramount Canada's Wonderland.\n In 2000, Paramount Parks purchased the majority of shares in Spanish theme park Terra Mitica (Land of Myth), branding it Terra Mitica: A Paramount Park. In 2004, Paramount dropped its shares in the park, and the name was reverted without the Paramount suffix.\n Paramount Parks were one of the few remaining seasonal park operators to exclusively use themed layouts and rides (a practice usually observed only by annual park operators such as Universal Theme Parks, Six Flags Theme Parks, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts). It's this aspect that likely helped the parks stand out against other regional competitors such as Cedar Fair (who later purchased the parks), who ran lightly themed amusement parks exclusively.\n For example, while Cedar Fair's flagship park Cedar Point debuted Wicked Twister and Top Thrill Dragster in 2002 and 2003, respectively, Paramount's Kings Island opened Tomb Raider: The Ride and Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Mansion. These two attractions, while costing only slightly less than Cedar Point's additions, were indoor, highly themed, immersive rides with synchronized musical scores and Hollywood special effects. The same can be said of Paramount's last additions to their parks, The Italian Job: Stunt Track, which are family-oriented roller coasters that also feature flames, water, synchronized music, and many movie props.\n When Cedar Fair acquired the Paramount Parks, they revolutionized their own season pass system using Paramount's as a blueprint, and also absorbed some of Paramount's theme-focused entertainment, combining it with their own well-proven thrills to create some of their most famous attractions: Maverick at Cedar Point and Diamondback at Kings Island, among others.\n Without the Paramount Pictures film licenses, many of the rides at the Paramount Parks were renamed to more generic names so as not to infringe on Paramount's copyrights. Many of these changes were \"in name only,\" having no actual bearing on the ride's appearance. Because of the level of theme involved in Paramount's later rides, though, (such as The Italian Job: Stunt Track and Tomb Raider: The Ride) some rides did lose core elements, such as synchronized musical scores, special effects, and pre-shows (thereby eliminating story lines).\n Perhaps the most notable change between park owners, Kings Island's $20,000,000, indoor Tomb Raider: The Ride had its water effects, lasers, Hollywood lighting, pre-show, synchronized musical score, film props, artificial fog, and flame effects removed. Notably, The Crypt at Kings Dominion, similar to the ride at Kings Island with the exception that it was outdoors, retained all of its original theming, music, film props, lighting, fog, and flames.\n On January 27, 2006, the then-newly minted CBS Corporation announced its intent to sell Paramount Parks due to the fact that it did not fit well within the company's core business (producing and distributing television content). A number of groups expressed interest in purchasing the company, several placed bids, and On May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the Paramount Parks chain, including Star Trek: The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of Bonfante Gardens. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at $1.24 billion USD.[2][3] Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair LP announced that it would do business under the name Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Cedar Fair LP remains the legal company name.[4]\n The individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season. After 14 years of great successful thrills, due to poor sales, Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount's prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. Bonfante Gardens was changed to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began deleting references to Paramount Pictures from all parks.\n Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as Star Trek and Tomb Raider, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee. All references to Paramount/CBS-licensed properties were left off from the parks before the beginning of the 2007 season, after 14 years of successful entertainment experience, poor sales.[5]\n On 10 October 2011, it was reported that Paramount would develop a theme park in Murcia, Spain with work set to start in 2012. The $1.5 billion Paramount Murcia park was hoped to rival Disneyland Paris as a European tourist destination. The resort would have featured 30 attractions with an adjacent shopping center, hotels and casino.[6]\n In November 2013, there were indications that the promoter and developer of Paramount Murcia (Premursa SA) would be in a position to open the park to the public in the second half of 2015; however this never happened.[7]\n Following further set backs such as the death of the promoting companies CEO (Jesus Samper)[8] and a High Court ruling, the construction of this park did not continue, and the area was instead expected to be reclassified for agricultural purposes.[9]\n On 8 October 2012, developers unveiled plans for a new \u00a32billion Paramount licensed theme park on the Swanscombe peninsula, Kent, in the United Kingdom.[10]\n Dubbed Paramount Kent, the site is 17 minutes from London by train to the nearby Ebbsfleet International Station and the development is projected to create 27,000 jobs.

It was traditionally taken to be 120 acres (49 hectares), but was in fact a measure of value and tax assessment, including obligations for food-rent (feorm), maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications, manpower for the army (fyrd), and (eventually) the geld land tax. The hide's method of calculation is now obscure: different properties with the same hidage could vary greatly in extent even in the same county. Following the Norman Conquest of England, the hidage assessments were recorded in the Domesday Book and there was a tendency for land producing \u00a31 of income per year to be assessed at 1 hide. The Norman kings continued to use the unit for their tax assessments until the end of the 12th century.\n The hide was divided into 4 yardlands or virgates. It was hence nominally equivalent in area to a carucate,[1] a unit used in the Danelaw.\n The Anglo-Saxon word for a hide was hid (or its synonym hiwisc). Both words are believed to be derived from the same root hiwan, which meant \"family\".\n Bede in his Ecclesiastical History (c. 731) describes the extent of a territory by the number of families which it supported, as (for instance), in Latin, terra x familiarum meaning 'a territory of ten families'. In the Anglo-Saxon version of the same work hid or hiwan is used in place of terra ... familiarum. Other documents of the period show the same equivalence and it is clear that the word hide originally signified land sufficient for the support of a peasant and his household[2] or of a 'family', which may have had an extended meaning. It is uncertain whether it meant the immediate family or a more extensive group.[3]\n Charles-Edwards suggests that in its early usage it referred to the land of one family, worked by one plough and that ownership of a hide conferred the status of a freeman,[4] to whom Stenton referred as \"the independent master of a peasant household\".[5]\n Hides of land formed the basis for tax levies used to equip free warriors (miles) of the Holy Roman Empire. In 807 it was specified that in the region west of the Seine, for example, a vassal who held four or five hides was responsible for showing up to a muster in person, fully equipped for war. Three men who each possessed one hide, though, merely were grouped such that two of them were responsible for equipping the third, who would go to war in their name. Those holding half-hides were responsible for readying one man for every group of six. This came about as a way of ensuring that the liege took to the field with a fully equipped and provisioned force.[6]\n In early Anglo-Saxon England, the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of food rent (known as feorm) due from a village or estate and it became the unit on which all public obligations were assessed, including in particular the maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications and the provision of troops for manning the defences of a town or for the defence force known as the 'fyrd'. For instance, at one period, five hides were expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep.[7]\n A land tax known as geld was first levied in 990 and this became known as the Danegeld, as it was used to buy off the Danes who were then raiding and invading the country. It was raised again for the same purpose on several occasions. The already existing system of assessment of land in hides was utilised to raise the geld, which was levied at a stated rate per hide (e.g. two shillings per hide). Subsequently the same system was used for general taxation and the geld was raised as required.[8]\n The hide was a measure of value rather than a measurement of area,[9] but the logic of its assessment is not easy to understand, especially as assessments were changed from time to time and not always consistently. By the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was a measure of 'the taxable worth of an area of land', but it had no fixed relationship to its area, the number of ploughteams working on it, or its population; nor was it limited to the arable land on an estate. According to Bailey, \"It is a commonplace that the hide in 1086 had a very variable extent on the ground; the old concept of 120 acres cannot be sustained.\"[10]  Many details of the development of the system during the 350 years which elapsed between  the time of Bede and the Domesday Book remain obscure. According to Sir Frank Stenton, \"Despite the work of many great scholars the hide of early English texts remains a term of elusive meaning.\"[11] The fact that assessments consistently tended to be made in units of 5 hides or multiples of 5 hides goes to show that we are not speaking of fixed or even approximate acreages and this applies not only to the 11th century but to charters of the 7th and 8th centuries.[12]\n Nevertheless, the hide became the basis of an artificial system of assessment of land for purposes of taxation, which lasted for a long period. The most consistent aspect of the hide is described as follows by Dr Sally Harvey (referring particularly to Domesday Book): \"Both Maitland and Vinogradoff long ago noticed that there was a general tendency throughout Domesday for a hide of land to be worth \u00a31, or, put another way, for land producing \u00a31 of income to be assessed at one hide.\"[13]\n A number of early documents referring to hides have survived, but these can only be seen as steps in the development of the concept of the hide and do not enable us to see the full story.\n The document known as the Tribal Hidage is a very early list thought to date possibly from the 7th century, but known only from a later and unreliable manuscript. It is a list of tribes and small kingdoms owing tribute to an overlord and of the proportionate liability or quota imposed on each of them. This is expressed in terms of hides, though we have no details as to how these were arrived at nor how they were converted into a cash liability.[14]\n The Burghal Hidage (early 10th century) is a list of boroughs giving the hide assessments of neighbouring districts which were liable to contribute to the defence of the borough, each contributing to the maintenance and manning of the fortifications in proportion to the number of hides for which they answered.[15]\n The County Hidage (early 11th century) lists the total number of hides to be assessed on each county and it seems that by this time at least the total number of hides in a given area was imposed from above. Each county was assigned a round number of hides, for which it would be required to answer. For instance, at an early date in the 11th century, Northamptonshire was assigned 3,200 hides, while Staffordshire was assigned only 500.[16] This number was then divided up between the hundreds in the county. Theoretically there were 100 hides in each hundred, but this proportion was often not maintained, for example because of changes in the hundreds or in the estates comprising them or because assessments were altered when the actual cash liability was perceived as being too high or too low or for other reasons now unknown.\n The hides within each hundred were then divided between villages, estates or manors, usually in blocks or multiples of 5 hides, though this was not always maintained. Differences from the norm could result from estates being moved from one hundred to another, or from adjustments to the size of an estate or alterations in the number of hides for which an estate should answer.[17]\n As each local community had the task of deciding how its quota of hides should be divided between the lands held by that community, different communities used different criteria, depending on the type of land held and on the way in which an individual's wealth was reckoned within that community, it is self-evident that no single comprehensive definition is possible.\n The Norman kings, after the Norman Conquest, continued to use the system which they found in place. Geld was levied at intervals on the existing hidage assessments. In  1084,  William I laid an exceptionally heavy geld  of six shillings upon every hide. At the time the value of  the hide was approximating twenty shillings a year,  and the price of an ox was two shillings. Thus the holder of a hide had a  tax burden equivalent to three of his oxen and close upon one-third  of the annual value of his land.[8] A more normal rate was 2 shillings on each hide.\n Domesday Book, recording the results of the survey made on the orders of William I  in 1086, states in hides (or carucates or sulungs as the case might be) the assessed values of estates throughout the area covered by the survey.[18] Usually it gives this information for 1086 and 1066, but some counties were different and only showed this information for one of those dates. By that time the assessments showed many anomalies.[18] Many of the hide assessments on lands held by tenants-in-chief were reduced between 1066  and 1086 in order to effect an exemption from or reduction in tax; this again shows that the hide is a tax assessment, not an area of land.[19]\n Sometimes, the assessment in hides is given both for the whole manor and for the demesne land (i.e. the lord's own demesne) included in it.  Dr Sally Harvey has suggested that the ploughland data in Domesday Book was intended to be used for a complete re-assessment but, if so, it was never actually made.[20] The Pipe Rolls, where they are available, show that levies were based largely on the old assessments, though with some amendments and exemptions.\n The last recorded levy was for 1162-3 during the reign of Henry II, but the tax was not formally abolished and Henry II thought of using it again between 1173 and 1175. The old assessments were used for a tax on land in 1193-4 to raise money for King Richard's ransom.[21]\n A hide was usually made up of four virgates although exceptionally Sussex had eight virgates to the hide.[22] A similar measure was used in the northern Danelaw, known as a  carucate, consisting of eight bovates, and Kent used a system based on a \"sulung\", consisting of four yokes, which was larger than the hide and on occasion treated as equivalent to two hides.[23] These measures had a different origin, signifying the amount of land which could be cultivated by one plough team as opposed to a family holding, but all later became artificial fiscal assessments.\n In some counties in Domesday Book (e.g. Cambridgeshire), the hide is sometimes shown as consisting of 120 acres (30 acres to the virgate), but as Darby explains: \"The acres are, of course, not units of area, but geld acres, i.e. units of assessment\". In other words, this was a way of dividing the tax assessment on the hide between several owners of parts of the land assessed. The owner of land assessed at 40 notional (or 'fiscal') acres in a village assessed at 10 hides and paying geld of 2 shillings per hide would be responsible for one-third (\u200b40\u2044120) of 2 shillings\u2014that is, 8 pence\u2014though his land might be considerably more or less than 40 modern statute acres in extent.[24]\n Much work has been done investigating the hidation of various counties and also in attempts to discover more about the origin and development of the hide and the purposes for which it was used, but without producing many clear conclusions which would help the general reader.

Walter, born in Colorado 1901, died in 1962 in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, was an American textile manufacturer.\n Harold John Walter was born and raised in Colorado. He grew up in Colorado and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1923, at the age of 21.  He went to work in the textile industry and rose to become a well known industrialist and entrepreneur, known for research in the manufacturing of textiles. He rose to be the CEO of the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company, headquartered in the town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts.\n Walter modestly credited his success in an article in Time Magazine to \"marrying the boss's daughter\". Charles Arthur Root, a local industrialized who had founded the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company was his father-in-law. Harold later became the President of the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company. At its peak it was one of the most successful textile companies in America. The company had thirteen plants nationwide, with 6000 workers, and in four states, and was written up in Time Magazine in August 1953 in an article entitled \"the Pride of Uxbridge\". The Bachman Uxbridge Worsted company was a pioneer in blending synthetics with woolen manufacturing. The company boasted 75% percent increases in productivity with a variety of processes including air conditioned plants. Their proprietary processes produced material that led the U.S. in women's wear in the 1950s. The company had a long history of producing military uniforms, and produced the dress uniforms for the U.S. Army and \"the first U.S. Air Force Uniform\". They developed highly productive processes for making yarn. See also the articles on Colonel John Capron, Bernat Mill, and Uxbridge, Massachusetts.\n The mill was featured in the August 24, 1953 edition of Time Magazine, in an article entitled, \"The Pride of Uxbridge\"[1] as the site of the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company, which was then one of the most successful textile mills in New England.[1] Research into textiles at Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company produced a range of blended fabrics, including the \"wool-nylon serge\" used for army uniforms. The original U.S. Air Force Uniform produced at the factory was dubbed and patented \"Uxbridge Blue\" or \"Uxbridge 1683\", after blue dye color selected at Bachman Uxbridge. This dye was used in the manufacture of uniforms from 1947.[2]\n", " John (Johann von Pfalz-Neumarkt; 1383 \u2013 14 March 1443) was the Count Palatine of Neumarkt from 1410 to his death.

Brown has published research on many aspects of how economies function, including high-tech industries, development engineering, the standard of living, wage determination, poverty, and unemployment.[2]\n Brown was born in 1946 in Tampa, Florida. Her father, Norman Brown, was an attorney, and her mother, Mary Shackleford, graduated in economics from Florida State University. Brown was close to her African-American nanny, and realized at an early age that the discrimination against African-Americans and Cubanos was unjust and cruel. She graduated from Wellesley College with a math major in 1968. In 1973, Brown received her PhD in economics at the University of Maryland, where she studied under Barbara Bergmann and Charles Schultz. She was a doctoral fellow at the Brookings Institution, and then joined the UC Berkeley economics faculty in 1973. Clair is married to Richard Katz, and has two sons (Daniel and Jason) and two grandsons (Max and Timothy).[3]\n Brown uses an institutional approach to economic analysis, where social rules and customs or norms structure firm and individual behavior that plays out in the marketplace, following in the long line from Veblen to Commons to Williamson. Her early research demonstrated that time and income were not substitutes in many household activities, and this observation has a major impact on women\u2019s use of time, on the constraints faced by one-parent households, and on the constraints faced by unemployed people, as well as important implications for social policies.[4][5][6][7] Then concerned about the standard of living, especially of the poor and working class, Brown began her study of U.S. household budgets. Using an institutional approach that assumes families based their own sense of well-being on how well they are doing compared to others, Brown used a relative income approach, which had been developed by Duesenberry. Following Marshall, Brown assumed that family expenditures could be divided into basics (necessaries), variety (comforts), and status (luxuries or positional goods).[8]\n As the United States became agitated over the rapid rise of Japanese industry in the 1980s and 1990s, Brown studied the relationship between human resource systems and firm performance in the automobile and communication industries. This required fieldwork observation and data collection, from firms and workers in both the United States and Japan. Fieldwork data provided a way of verifying interpretations of large data sets and of the consistency of the data with observed behavior.[9] In her work with Julia Lane using the Census LEHD data set, they demonstrated how rich field data combined with large survey data yield strong evidence for studying specific economic activities.[10]\n Joining U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Competitive Semiconductor Manufacturing Program headed by Dean Dave Hodges and Professor Rob Leachman in engineering, Brown headed the human resources group, with the goal of studying how the HR system structured worker input into problem solving and process improvements and how workers acquired new knowledge and skills. With her new focus on mostly well-educated men, Brown asked, \u201cDoes education and then a good job allow people to achieve a middle-class life style and leave labor market problems behind?\u201d The answer was a complicated \u201cno\u201d. High-tech labor markets were undergoing a critical restructuring, and lifelong employment systems at leading multinational companies ended as companies adopted more market-oriented HR systems. Engineers faced problems as they were forced to change jobs. Many faced lower earnings and even unemployment as they aged. Once again, institutions mattered \u2013 workers could no longer depend on an illustrious career at one company, and being put out to pasture seemed to be the norm. Rapid technological change was also a fact of life in the semiconductor industry, and the industry faced one crisis after another. Brown wrote a book with Dr. Greg Linden analyzing eight crises that the semiconductor industry dealt with successfully.[11][12]\n As concern about globalization and US jobs grew, Brown teamed up with Tim Sturgeon and Julia Lane to develop a firm-based survey of global activities and employment in 2010. Brown expanded her research to include sustainability as global warming joined inequality as a challenge to economic policy, and this led to her development of Buddhist Economics as a field of study at UC Berkeley in 2011.[13] Buddhist economics integrates global sustainability and shared prosperity to provide a holistic model of economic behavior and well-being. Her book Buddhist Economics: An enlightened approach to the dismal science will be published by Bloomsbury Press in February 2017.[14]\n In 2013 at UC Berkeley, Brown helped create a new program called Development Engineering, for graduate students in engineering and economics to develop their multidisciplinary skills for designing, building, and evaluating new technologies to help developing regions. Using the Buddhist economics framework, Brown's team is developing a measure of economic performance based on the quality of life, and estimating it for state of California. This index integrates measurements of inequality and environmental degradation as well as value of non-market activities and consumption to provide an inclusive measurement of sustainable economic performance to evaluate our economic performance and to guide policy.[15]\n Brown\u2019s contributions to the field of Labor Economics were recognized by the Labor and Employment Relations Association, who awarded her their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010.[16] Brown's economic approach and life as an economist is published in Eminent Economists II \u2013 Their Life and Work Philosophies (Cambridge University Press, 2013).[17]\n In her career spanning over 30 years, Brown has held the following positions.\n Brown with Dr. Michael McCulloch also collected and analyzed the data from a group of women treated with Supermannan, a natural cure for bladder infections discovered by Richard Katz.[26]\n", " K\u00fclalaid is a small island in the Baltic Sea belonging to the country of Estonia.

In early 1991 Jason Kells joined on lead guitar and at the end of that year the group's line-up was completed by Matthew Skarajew on bass guitar. In 1992 they issued an extended play, Dusk, on Relapse Records and followed with a studio album, Transcendence into the Peripheral, in 1993. They disbanded shortly thereafter \u2013 never having performed live. AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia described them as \"[s]till revered in underground circles as doom-grind pioneers ... [their works] remain genre classics\".\n Disembowelment formed in Melbourne in November 1989 out of the ashes of a two-piece grind band Bacteria, featuring Renato Gallina on guitar and vocals, and Paul Mazziotta on drums. With the help of Dean Ruprich from Melbourne death/grind band Necrotomy providing session bass guitar, the band released its first demo, \"Mourning September\" in September 1990. Disembowelment played a very slow form of doom \u2013 with occasional bursts of great speed \u2013 that relied equally on the atmospheric effects of droning guitars and constant riffing. The band was known for its atmospheric chanting, slow riffs and spiritual dark elements present in their symphonic, heavily distorted style. They are often credited with spawning the funeral doom movement that developed years later.\n In 1991, Jason Kells joined the band on lead guitar. The song \"Extracted Nails\" was recorded in April 1991 at Double Tea Studios for a compilation on the German label Mangled Beyond Recognition, released the following year. The compilation featured Therion, God Macabre, Rottrevore, Cadaver, Crematory, Pan.Thy.Monium, Cenotaph, Hydr Hydr. On 3\u20134 August 1991, the band went back to Double Tea studios to record their second demo, \"Deep Sensory Perception into Aural Fate\". This recording marked a big step forward in the maturity of the songwriting, performance and overall production. The demo sparked the interest of Relapse Records, who signed them up and released the demo as the Dusk extended play in 1992. It was an edited version of the demo which omitted the linking piece of music between the two tracks. It included the first recorded version of \"Cerulean Transience of all My Imagined Shores\", a third track not featured on the earlier demo.\n At the end of 1991, Matthew Skarajew (ex-Sanctum, lead guitar) had joined the group on bass guitar and they recorded \"Cerulean Transience of all My Imagined Shores\" the following year. Initially as full time bass guitarist for his early sessions, later he added guitar work (acoustic and melodic). In 1993 Disembowelment released their debut studio album, Transcendence into the Peripheral,[1] which featured a slowly executed drumming style, accompanied by death metal vocals, chants and passages of dark ambience. Disembowelment split up after the album's release. Prior to breaking up, they had mentioned the possibility of a one-off live show that \"would be an event, a unique concert\". However it never eventuated. At the time they had rehearsed and prepared five cover versions for a potential EP. \"Slaughtered Remains\" (cover of a Necrovore track) was a demo track which appeared in 2005 on a bonus disc of the limited release of Disembowelment compilation. This featured Mazziotta on drums, Skarajew on guitars and Gallina layered a new vocal track onto it 3 years later.\n Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia described Disembowelment as \"[s]till revered in underground circles as doom-grind pioneers ... [their works] remain genre classics\".[2] Justin Donnelly of Metal Forge declared they were \"the legendary unground  [sic] Australian doom/grindcore/ambient act\" and \"often referred to as merely a doom band, the sort of music ... is actually far more than eclectic and broad sounding than simply labelling them to one particular genre\".[1]\n Gallina and Skarajew continued working together in the ethno ambient act, Trial of the Bow, which Skarajew had initiated during his time in Disembowelment. The group released an EP, Ornamentation, and an album, Rite of Passage, to critical approval, notably Rolling Stone and Wired Magazine. Trial of the Bow was licensed to Rykodisc soon after. From 2004 Skarajew and Mazziotta formed a grind band, Pulgar. In October 2005 Disembowelment's catalogue was re-released as a double and limited edition triple CD, Disembowelment by Relapse Records.[1] Two different limited edition vinyl box sets were later released. A related band, d.USK, formed in 2010 with original Disembowelment members Skarajew and Mazziotta and played some their former group's material as a live band.[3] In late 2011 d.USK split and re-emerged under the name Inverloch, which plays a different form of death/doom than Disembowelment and d.USK.[4]\n", " \n William Hubble (20 June 1898 \u2013 14 December 1978) was an English cricketer.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade\u00a0II* listed building.[1]\n The viaduct was built during 1836 and was completed on 9\u00a0December of that year. It was the longest viaduct on the Grand Junction Railway (GJR)[2] and is an early example of a major railway viaduct.  Its cost was \u00a354,440 \n(equivalent to \u00a35,030,000 in 2018).[3]  The engineers were Joseph Locke and George Stephenson.[1]  The contractor was William Mackenzie.  It was the first project for which Thomas Brassey submitted a tender but Mackenzie's estimate was \u00a35,000 lower.[4]  It is built in red sandstone and has 20\u00a0arches. The base of the viaduct pillars are splayed to give greater stability and 700,000 cubic feet (20,000\u00a0m3) of stone was used in its construction. The first GJR trains to carry passengers across the viaduct were run on 4\u00a0July 1837.[2]  Steel masts were added in the 1960s for electrification.[1]  The viaduct is 60 feet (18\u00a0m) high and 500 yards (457\u00a0m) long.[5]\n The permitted speed on the viaduct is 125 miles per hour (200\u00a0km/h) and, because of limited trackside clearance, the viaduct is a 'red zone prohibited area', meaning that workers are not permitted on the line when trains are running unless separated by a permanent fence. A 'near miss' incident was recorded in September 2017 when line-side contractors carrying out a structural inspection on the viaduct crossed the tracks between obsolete refuges in breach of the red zone regulations.[6]\n", " This is a list of the schools and colleges run by, or in association with, the Roman Catholic Church in New Zealand (including one private traditionalist Roman Catholic school)\n \n", " Bela Vista de Goi\u00e1s is a city located in central Goi\u00e1s state in Brazil.\n It is 45 kilometers from the state capital of Goi\u00e2nia\n The municipality has boundaries with Hidrol\u00e2ndia, Caldazinha,  Aparecida de Goi\u00e2nia, Senador Canedo, and  Silv\u00e2nia.

The organization also becomes involved in the exchange of information from other areas of medicine, both in basic science and in clinical areas of teaching and research.[2]\n The AAP holds an Annual Meeting that features the latest and greatest topics pertinent to research, education, clinical care and the administration of physiatry. This five-day conference also features scientific poster presentations, committee and council meetings, networking events and much more.\n The mission of the AAP is carried out between meetings by working committees. The most active committees focus on academic affairs, education and research. Other committees address bylaws, membership, programs, nominations and financial matters. The members of the AAP shape its policies and programs through a Board of Trustees. The AAP officers maintain liaisons with a number of related scientific societies, government agencies and academic institutions. The AAP also sponsors several councils to stimulate, promote and coordinate the unique concerns of special interest groups within the organization. Current councils include PM&R chairs, residency program and fellowship directors, researchers, residency coordinators, residents and fellows, and residency program coordinators.\n The benefits of membership in the AAP are important for both the new and mature academic physiatrist. Among the many services are:\n Membership Criteria\n The Association Bylaws require that a prospective member be a physician qualified to practice medicine in the USA and Canada. Provision for a nonphysician to belong to the AAP is found in the affiliate member category. An academic physiatrist from a non-North American country can qualify as an international member. Associate, resident, affiliate, and international members enjoy all the benefits of membership except voting and holding office.\n Diplomate Members - A Diplomate member must be a physician qualified to practice medicine in the United States or Canada. He/she must hold an academic faculty appointment as a physiatrist in a US or Canadian medical school or be a full-time teaching physiatrist in a non-university-affiliated residency program. He/she must have a primary certificate of PM&R and be a Diplomate of the ABPMR or declared equally qualified by his/her country's specialty examining board (such as the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada). \n Associate Members - An Associate member is a physician qualified to practice medicine in the United States or Canada and is actively engaged in the practice of PM&R. An Associate member may be actively engaged in the training of physicians and/or students in PM&R. Physiatrists without faculty appointments and non-physiatrists who are certified in a subspecialty field by the ABPMR, but who have academic pursuits and/or interests in PM&R, may also qualify for Associate membership. Associate members enjoy all the privileges of membership except voting and holding office. \n Affiliate Members - An Academic Affiliate member is a nonphysician health care professional with an academic appointment in a division or department of PM&R in a North American Medical School. An Administrative Affiliate member is a nonphysician health care professional involved either in the administration of a PM&R division/department, residency training program or research program, or in the immediate supervision of the previously described individual. Affiliate members enjoy all the privileges of membership except voting and holding office. \n International Members - An International member is a physician legally qualified to practice medicine in his/her country of residence, with training and experience comparable to Diplomates of the ABPMR. An International member must also be actively engaged in the practice of PM&R as well as in physiatric research and/or the training of physicians/students in the specialty of physiatry. Sponsorship by a PM&R Chair is required. International members enjoy all of the privileges of membership except voting and holding office. \n Emeritus Members - Emeritus membership is for a physician permanently retired from the practice of medicine.\n In-Training Members - An In-Training member is a physician actively engaged in a training program leading to admissibility to the certifying examination of the ABPMR (or his/her country's equivalent examining board), or for a student in a North American medical school or osteopathic medical school.\n The AAP holds an Annual Meeting each year. The meeting offers an educational program with PM&R-specific workshops that offer continuing medical education (CME) as well as a job fair and exhibit hall.\n The AAP facilitates the exchange of ideas and information regarding the teaching of the art and science of PM&R through promoting the dissemination of:\n Program for Academic Leadership\n The Association of Academic Physiatrists, under the leadership of William Bockenek, MD, CPE, also sponsors the Program for Academic Leadership (PAL), a three-year program to develop academic leadership skills in junior PM&R faculty. The goal of PAL is to provide a basic administrative framework and skill set to promising physiatric academic faculty to enhance their leadership abilities within a Department, Medical School, and the field of PM&R at large. The number of participants is limited to provide maximum interaction with course instructors. This program requires candidates to attend the PAL course during each of three consecutive AAP Annual Meetings. Over the three years, the content covers department administration, teaching and education, and research.[3]\n The AAP promotes PM&R research by sponsoring the following programs:\n Rehabilitation Research Experience For Medical Students(RREMS) Scholarship Program\n The Association of Academic Physiatrists (AAP) and the Foundation for PM&R have sponsored a new scholarship program for the past three years.  Rehabilitation Research Experience for Medical Students (RREMS) is offered to allow first year medical students to experience the rewards of scholarly research within the specialty of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation through an eight-week summer externship.[4]\n Rehabilitation Medicine Scientist Training Program (RMSTP)\n Another program, The Rehabilitation Medicine Scientist Training Program (RMSTP), provides research training, mentorship and career development support for those physiatrists committed to developing productive careers in academic medicine and research. The ultimate aim of the RMSTP is to increase the number of rigorously trained, extramurally competitive and scientifically productive faculty members in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) departments, who can contribute to the continued development of physiatric research specifically and rehabilitation science in general.[5]\n The American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation is the official scholarly, peer-reviewed journal of the Association of Academic Physiatrists (AAP).\n The AAP Newsletter began in 1982 as a tool to provide academic physiatrists with information regarding the availability of clinical and research fellowships and research grants and contracts for projects relating directly or indirectly to Rehabilitation Medicine. In 1983, the AAP Board of Trustees authorized up to 4 editions of the Newsletter per year. Over the years, the information has expanded to include all material relevant to the field of PM&R to accomplish the AAP's mission of providing a forum to inform and stimulate discussion regarding relevant issues pertaining to academic physiatry and the AAP itself.[6]\n The Association of Academic Physiatrists (AAP) released the first issue of the AAP E-Brief in May 2010. This weekly e-newsletter provides members the latest news in the AAP, AJPM&R and PM&R highlights in a timely and convenient electronic format.\n Physiatry in Motion is the quarterly newsletter created by the AAP's Resident/Fellow Council (RFC) that features important topics on PM&R education, career development and practice.\n", " \n See text.\n Canthigaster is a genus in the pufferfish family (Tetraodontidae).

Apollo killed the dragon and then left for the land of the Hyperboreans in order to be expiated from the murder. This action signifies in mythology the transition from the early chthonic cults to the cult of the god of light and music. \nAt that spot, in front of the rocks marking the pass, a round square is formed, called Halos (literally: a threshing floor), where several rituals were taking place. Among these rituals was the Septerion, the ritual re-enactment of the murder of Python by Apollo, taking place once every eight years. Plutarch [1] mentions that during the ritual cleansing of the site a boy, whose parent were both alive, would set fire on a wooden construction symbolizing the dwelling of Python and then went on to cleanse himself as Apollo had done, taking recourse initially in the Tempi Valley. Around the Halos, particularly on its north side, platforms and bases for monuments were erected, particularly in the Hellenistic period. Among them stands out the base for a statue of the Pergamene king Attalus II Philadelphus(159-138 B.C.), dedicated by the city of Delphi. To the northeast the Halos is delimited by the Polygonal wall, built after the destruction of the Temple of Apollo (Delphi) in 548 B.C., in order to support the ground for the erection of the new temple that was going to be built under the auspices of the Alcmaeonids. To the north of the Halos stood the Portico of the Athenians, also lying against the Polygonal wall. In 1939, in the course of repair works along the Sacred Way, a repository was discovered in front of the Halos, in which a large number of ex votos and other liturgical objects was discovered. These ex votos had been destroyed at a prior phase, by fire or other causes, and, according to the practice in those days, they were buried because it was forbidden to recycle or sell them. The most important of these finds were the chryselephantine statues[2] of Apollo and Artemis and a silver bull.\n", " Hasan Zvizdi\u0107 (1892\u20131980)[1] was a commander of a detachment of Muslim militia from Sjenica (in Sand\u017eak) during the Second World War.[2] He was the main livestock wholesaler in the region which depended on animal husbandry, thus his influence in Sand\u017eak was strong.[3]\n Zvizdi\u0107 was a wealthy Muslim whole-trader in Sjenica. He became a city governor and armed many local Muslims and organized them as militia during the war.[4] In December 1941 Zvizdi\u0107 refused to allow Partisans to capture Sjenica because he was afraid that Chetniks, German and Italian forces would attack Partisans in Sjenica and kill many of its population as well. He explained to Partisans that he had around 5,000 members of Muslim militia under his command and that he will used them against Partisans or Chetniks if they try to capture Sjenica.[5] According to historian \u017divkovi\u0107, Zvizdi\u0107 was actually concerned that his lucrative contracts to supply Italian and German army with livestock would be cancelled if Partisans capture the city.[6]\n On 22 December 1941 forces of Muslim militia from Prijepolje, commanded by Pa\u010dariz, and from Sjenica commanded by Zvizdi\u0107 successfully repelled the attack of Partisans who tried to capture Sjenica.[7] They were supported by one company from Tutin, commanded by D\u017eemail Koni\u010danin, who joined them based on invitation of Zvizdi\u0107.[8]\n At the beginning of February 1942 detachments of Muslim militia from Sjenica under command of Zvizdi\u0107, together with Prijepolje, Brodarevo and Komaran militia detachments in cooperation with Chetniks under command of Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and with Italian forces, were planned to attack Partisans who were retreating through Sand\u017eak after their defeat in U\u017eice. When Pa\u010dariz realized that Partisans managed to defeat Chetniks, he did not dare to attack Partisans, but decided to move his forces to Sjenica to help Zvizdi\u0107 in case Partisans decide to attack the town again.[9]\n Zvizdi\u0107 was very influential not only in Sjenica and Tutin, but also in wider region. He thought that it is useful to visit Chetnik headquarter and to negotiate with Dra\u017ea Mihajlovi\u0107.[10] On 27 June Zvizdi\u0107 and other Muslim and Albanian leaders (including A\u0107if Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107, Xhafer Deva, Ferhat Bey Draga and Ahmet Daca) negotiated with representatives of Chetniks of Dra\u017ea Mihajlovi\u0107. The negotiations ended with agreement on cooperation in the joint struggle against Communists.[11] Milorad Ekme\u010di\u0107 refer to Zvizdi\u0107 as Muslim Chetnik leader.[12]\n Karl von Krempler planned to establish Sand\u017eak as separate political entity and offered to Zvizdi\u0107 a position of its governor. Zvizdi\u0107 refused Krempler's offer.[13] When Germans took control over Montenegro after the capitulation of Italy at the end of 1943 they established a puppet Government with Hasan Zvizdi\u0107 as its minister without portfolio.[14]\n After the war he emigrated from Yugoslavia to avoid being captured and executed by Partisans. He died in 1980 in Adapazar\u0131, Turkey. In 2012 a commemorative plaque was revealed in front of the house in which Zvizdi\u0107 lived.[15]\n", " The Holy Cross Inns Court Vicarage (grid reference ST587691) is in the Knowle West area of Bristol, England.\n It was built in the 15th century.

The commissions had been created under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944, and their initial reviews of constituencies had been implemented by the Representation of the People Act 1948.[1]\n Under the 1949 Act, each commission was to make its first periodic report within seven years of the passing of the Representation of the People Act 1948. Subsequent reports were to be issued not less than three and not more than seven years after the first periodic report. Reports were to be made to the Home Secretary, and were to contain the proposed constituency boundaries. The Home Secretary could then issue a draft Order in Council, to be approved by both houses of parliament. Once approved, the draft order would be presented to the Privy Council, and enacted via a statutory instrument. Any changes in seats would not take place until the next dissolution of parliament and calling of a general election.\n The Act contained a number of rules to guide the work of the commissions.\n \"As far as practicable\" in England and Wales: \n In Scotland:\n In Northern Ireland: \n The electorate of any constituency was to be as close as possible to a country-specific electoral quota to reduce malapportionment; where rigid adherence to the \"as far as practicable\" guidelines would mean a large disparity between electorates, the commissions were expressly empowered to form seats which combine parts of two (and where major disparity still remains, more) local government areas.\n The electoral quota was obtained by dividing the total electorate for either Great Britain or Northern Ireland by the number of allocated seats.\n Each commission were allowed to depart from the rules on areas or electorate in special cases \"including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency\" in order to form constituencies.\n The 1949 Act was amended by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958. The 1958 legislation removed the Director General of the Ordnance Survey from each commission, and in each case appointed a judge to be deputy chairman. It also modified the definition of the term \"electoral quota\" so that in future the total electorate of each part of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) was to have a different quota, calculated by dividing by the number of constituencies then in existence. A new procedure was established, forcing a local inquiry to be held where there were large numbers of objections to changes. \n The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1979 amended the 1949 Act in respect to Northern Ireland, increasing the number of constituencies in the province to 17 in number. Northern Ireland had been under-represented in the Commons to compensate for the existence of a devolved parliament. However, this had been abolished in 1973. The number of seats could be decreased to 16 or increased to 18 in the future.\n The 1949, 1958 and 1979 Acts were repealed by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, which remains the current primary legislation governing allocation of constituencies.\n", " Brian Patrick Sikorski (born July 27, 1974 in Detroit, Michigan) is a former baseball relief pitcher.\n Although Sikorski made his MLB debut in 2000, he didn't play another game in the big leagues until 2006. He played professional baseball in Japan for five years, until 2005 for the Yomiuri Giants.\n The Cleveland Indians acquired Sikorski in a trade July 18, 2006, by sending right-handed pitcher Mike Adams to the San Diego Padres. On May 17, 2007, Sikorski's contract was sold to the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. He signed to play for the Chiba Lotte Marines in 2008.  After two more seasons with the Marines, Sikorski signed a contract with the Saitama Seibu Lions to be the team's closer in 2010.  Securing the closer spot for the first time in his Japanese career, Sikorski responded, as of August 29, 2010, he leads the Pacific League in saves with 30, and he did not blow a save until August 20 against the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.  Until the 2010 season, Sikorski's record for saves was 15; this was broken on May 25 against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.\n Sikorski attended Western Michigan University and obtained a degree in criminology. Brian was drafted in the fourth round of the 1995 amateur entry draft by the Houston Astros.\n Like many pitchers, Sikorski is known for his strict adherence to his pre-pitching routine.  Two of his most noticeable routines are how he vigorously swings his right (pitching) arm in a windmill-style circle, both forwards and backwards before throwing his warmup pitches.  Also, after getting the third out of the inning, he sprints off the mound and jumps over the foul line on the way to his team's dugout, resulting in him usually being the first one in.\n In 2016, Sikorski was listed as a member of the Texas Rangers' professional scouting staff, based in Fraser, Michigan.\n", " Roy Muir Kinnear (3 February 1904 \u2013 22 September 1942) was a Scottish dual-code international rugby union, and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s and 1930s.

His works include the first overview of the geography and history of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n Lastri\u0107 was born in a hamlet called Lastre, from which his cognomen derives, part of the village O\u0107evija near Vare\u0161 in the Sanjak of Bosnia, Ottoman Empire. Christened Martin, he was one of at least four children of Jakov Ivani\u0107. The family was quite poor. His younger sisters, An\u0111elija and Lucija, lived in Kraljeva Sutjeska following marriage, while a brother is known to have required financial help from the already ordained Lastri\u0107.[1]\n Lastri\u0107 probably came to the monastery of Kraljeva Sutjeska between 1712 and 1714, as the rules of the monastery stipulated that the boys should be between 12 and 14 years old upon arrival. At the monastery, Lastri\u0107 learned to read and write in \"Illyrian, Latin and Italian language\", as well as the bosan\u010dica and Latin script.[1] He became a novice in 1719, taking the name Filip. He continued his studies in the Papal States town of Narni, where he was ordained a priest in 1724.[2]\n Lastri\u0107's career started in the Slavonian town of Po\u017eega, where he taught philosophy between 1726 and 1729. He then returned to Kraljeva Sutjeska, becoming teacher of the novices. He became custos of Bosna Argentina in 1734, and was promoted to provincial superior in 1741. As such, he was very vocal in defending Bosnian Franciscans and lay Catholics in Rome and Vienna as well as in Ottoman courts. He served as provincial superior until 1745.[3] Thanks to Lastri\u0107's insistence in Rome, Bosna Srebrena was restored to the rank of province by Pope Clement XIII on 15 December 1758, a year after it was demoted to a custody due to the low number of monasteries and friars.[2]\n Filip Lastri\u0107 died of a heart attack in Kraljeva Sutjeska on 19 April 1783.[2]\n The surviving works by Filip Lastri\u0107 include a philosophy manual (preserved in manuscript) composed during his stay in Po\u017eega, four sermon collections, as well as an overview of the history of Bosna Srebrena. The latter, titled Epitome vetustatum Bosnensis provinciae (Pregled starina Bosanske provincije) and published in 1765, includes the first work on Bosnian geography and history.[2] Lastri\u0107 also assisted foreigners in their writings about Bosnia, such as the Venetian Jesuit Daniele Farlati (Illyricum sacrum) and the Hungarian Piarist Elek Hor\u00e1nyi.[2] Lastri\u0107's other notable works are:[3]\n", " \n", " Bertea is a commune in Prahova County, Romania.

Joan Comorera of the Uni\u00f3 Socialista did not want the new party to be affiliated with any international group.\nEventually, however, Comorera and Vidiella agreed that the new party could adhere to the Comintern, and it was launched.[4]\nIn May 1936 Vidiella resigned from the PSOE national committee.[5]\nAfter a few months Comorera and Vidiella became members of the Partido Comunista Espa\u00f1ol (PCE, Spanish Communist Party) central committee.[6]\nAt first the  Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya (PSUC, Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia) had between two and five thousand members, but by March 1937 it may have had 50,000.[4]\n On 21 July 1936 the Generalitat passed a decree recognizing the Central Committee of Anti-fascist Militias of Catalonia.[7]\nVidiella and Fern\u00e1ndez were given charge of the Investigation Commission.[8]\n In the government of the Catalan Generalitat named by President Llu\u00eds Companys on 31 July 1936 the PSUC was given three ministries. \nJoan Comorera was Minister of the Economy, Rafael Vidiella was Minister of Communications and Estanislau Ruiz Ponsetti was Minister of Supplies.[9]\nThe government wanted to avoid trials of people charged with murder during the revolutionary period that followed the defeat of the 18 July 1936 military uprising in Catalonia.\nVidiella prepared a press release which said the Council of the Generalitat had unanimously accepted his proposal to order the courts not to treat \"revolutionary events\" as crimes.\nCompanys said it should not be published, but Vidiella went ahead anyway and the report appeared in the newspapers.\nThere was no public denial.[10]\nThe dominant CNT-FAI objected to the inclusion of the PSUC, and on 6 August 1936 a new government was formed that excluded the PSUC.[9]\n On 17 December 1936 a new \"syndical\" government of Catalonia took office. Three members of the PSUC represented the UGT in this government: Vidiella (Justice), Comorera (Provisions) and Miquel Vald\u00e9s (Labor and Public Works).[11]\nOn 16 April 1937 there was a cabinet reshuffle and Vidiella became Minister of Labor and Public Works.[12]\nOn 25 April 1937 Rold\u00e1n Cortada, a PSUC leader, was murdered. \nVidiella accused the anarchists of responsibility, and this led to the May Days clashes between the Stalinists and anarchists in the first week of May 1937.[13]\n On 5 May 1937 the government resigned. Antonio Ses\u00e9, the PSUC secretary, was killed shortly after being appointed to the new Executive Council of the Generalidad.\nVidiella was appointed Minister of Public Order, Justice and Labor in his place.[14]\nOn 28 June 1937 Companys formed a new government in which Vidiella was Minister of Labor and Public Works.\nHe would hold this post for the remainder of the civil war.[15]\nOn 7 September 1937 Vidiella said \"the judges cannot consider accusations having to do with the revolutionary events provoked by the rebellious generals, since to do so would be to prosecute the revolution itself.\"[16]\n After the civil war Vidiella lived in exile in several countries before settling in Budapest.\nDuring the struggle between Joan Comorera and the leadership of the Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a (PCE, Spanish Communist Party) he sided with the latter.\nFor several years he was one of the leaders of the PCE.\nHe contributed to the magazine Nous Horitzons founded in 1960.[1]\nIn 1976 he returned to Spain and settled in Barcelona, where he died on 23 September 1982.[17]\n", " Nirb\u012bja (Sanskrit; or P\u0101li: nibbija or nibija).

Dalton expanded to become the largest retailer of hardcover books in the United States, with 798 stores at the peak of the chain's success.[1]\n Located primarily in shopping malls, B. Dalton competed primarily with Waldenbooks. Barnes & Noble acquired the chain from Dayton's in 1987 and continued to operate it until a late 2009 announcement that the last 50 stores would be liquidated by January 2010.\n Bruce Dayton, a member of the family that operated Dayton's, a department store chain based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, founded the B. Dalton chain in 1966.[2] He named the bookstore chain after himself, but substituted an L for the Y in his surname.[1] The name B. Dalton was also chosen because it \"connoted quality, dependability and authority.\"[2]\n The first store opened in nearby Edina in August of that year, followed by a second in St. Louis, Missouri. Although the chain was originally intended to operate in downtowns and suburban areas, the majority of the stores were opened inside regional shopping malls. In 1969, Dayton's merged with Hudson's of Detroit and became Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation).[3]\n B. Dalton expanded throughout the 1960s and 1970s, going from twelve stores in 1968 to 125 five years later, peaking at 798 locations in 1986.[3] In 1968, the chain acquired Pickwick Books of California; they merged in 1979.[2] B. Dalton had stores in 43 of 50 states in 1978, and was second to Waldenbooks (then the U.S.'s largest bookstore) in store numbers, but posted higher profits than its rival.[3][4] A flagship store opened in Manhattan in December 1978,[3] and between 1983 and 1986, the chain revived the Pickwick name as a discount bookstore.\n By 1986, discounting practices by rival book chains had caused declining profits for B. Dalton stores, as had the decrease in new shopping malls.[3] As a result of the declining profits, Dayton Hudson Corporation sold the B. Dalton chain to Barnes & Noble.[2][5]  Under Barnes & Noble's ownership, B. Dalton acquired Scribner Book Stores, Inc. from Rizzoli International Bookstores in 1989,[6] and began a video game store called Software, Etc. (now GameStop).[3] At the same time, the chain began closing outlets and relocating others, while opening other prototypes. By 1997, the chain had shrunk to 528 locations,[3] and continued to close many more over the next decade.\n In January 2010, Barnes & Noble closed the last 50 B. Dalton locations,[7] except for the stores at Union Station in Washington, D.C. and Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, New York.[8]\n In January 2012, B. Dalton closed one of the last two locations at Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, New York. Barnes & Noble closed the Union Station (Washington D.C.) location at the end of February, 2013.\n Initially, B. Dalton targeted middle-class suburban customers, with stores that featured parquet flooring and wide aisles.[3] Later the store switched to a mass-market approach, allowing for a wider range of titles. B. Dalton was also one of the first chains to display hardcover and paperback books side by side.[3]\nB. Dalton was also a longtime sponsor of the PBS TV series Reading Rainbow.\n In 1985, B. Dalton opened the first Software Etc., which sold computer books, magazines, and software products.[3] Software Etc. initially began operating in B. Dalton book stores but was spun off in 1987 and began focusing on standalone stores. In 1994, Software Etc. successfully merged with competitor Babbage's. In 1996, NeoStar Retail Group Inc., then owner of Software Etc. and Babbage's, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put the two chains up for sale. By November, NeoStar had failed to find a buyer and announced that all 707 stores owned by the company would close in the next year.[9] By November 26, the plan to close the stores was halted, as NeoStar's assets were sold to an investor group led by retailer Leonard Riggio. In 1999, the newly formed Babbage's Etc. launched the GameStop chain and was sold to Barnes & Noble. The sale reunited the Software Etc. chain with its original parent company, B. Dalton. Barnes & Noble purchased Funco, Inc. in 2000 and merged Babbage's Etc. to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco. Funco changed its name to GameStop, Inc. and became independent from Barnes & Noble by 2004.

Day represented Wales for the first two games of the tournament, a narrow win over England at Cardiff and a more convincing victory over the Scottish away at Raeburn Place. Although Day was replaced by Swansea's David Samuel for the final game, the resulting win over Ireland gave Wales the Championship, and made Day a Triple Crown winner.\n Day played two more international games for Wales, both as part of the 1894 Home Nations Championship.

Initially released in 2003,[2] it was developed by Capcom Production Studio 1 and was the first entry in the Resident Evil video game series to feature cooperative gameplay and online multiplayer support,[3][4][5] although online support was not available for the PAL versions of the game.\n Outbreak was produced by Tsuyoshi Tanaka, and depicts a series of episodic storylines in the fictional location Raccoon City. It was set during the same general time period as Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Outbreak was followed by a standalone expansion entitled Resident Evil Outbreak File #2. The game was praised for the graphics, fun-factor, and multiplayer but criticized for the lack of voice chat.\n The controls and gameplay are similar to the Resident Evil remake, which was exclusive to the Nintendo Gamecube, with quite a few adjustments. The player chooses a scenario, difficulty level, and a character. The difficulty level is tied to what enemies and items the player encounters as they progress through the scenario. The game has five scenarios, each of which has an event checklist consisting of special actions that the player must perform to reach 100% completion. Upon doing so the player will unlock \"Infinity Mode\", in which all the player's weapons never break or run out of ammunition.\n Each scenario also has \"SP\" items. These are invisible items hidden throughout the level and are randomly generated on two paths[clarification needed]. There are 20 scenario items for each scenario, and twenty items specific to each character hidden across the five scenarios. If acquired, these items unlock new costumes and the option to listen to their ad-libs.\n Players were able to connect to the internet servers using a broadband connection and a network adapter. Account registration and login were required. Once players connected and logged in, they would choose between Free Mode and Scenario Mode. Free Mode took place in a lobby and allowed players to create their own games, scenarios, and difficulty level. Scenario Mode would choose the scenario and players automatically. When a player first started online, they would begin on the \"Outbreak\" scenario and progress from there. If the player wished to stop playing, they could save their data and restart from the scenario they were up to at the time. If the player had beaten a scenario, they acquired a star next to their name.\n Capcom shut down the American servers for Outbreak on December 31, 2007, and the Japanese servers on June 30, 2011, ending official online capabilities. In 2014, private servers became available to Japanese editions of Resident Evil Outbreak.[6]\n The beginning of Outbreak is set a couple of days after the initial outbreak of the T-virus in Raccoon City, moments before the crisis further escalates into complete chaos. The game starts with the eight characters in J's Bar, who are unaware of what is happening until a lone zombie wanders into the bar and attacks one of the employees named Will. After that, the characters must make it through the city. The game ends in the final moments of the same incident, with the player attempting to escape Raccoon City before the U.S. government launches a missile strike to eliminate the threat posed by the G-virus. The player controls one of eight characters, in order: Kevin Ryman, Mark Wilkins, Jim Chapman, George Hamilton, David King, Alyssa Ashcroft, Yoko Suzuki, and Cindy Lennox, along with numerous supporting characters who can be selected in their place. Gameplay events transpire across various regions of Raccoon City and span over a period of several days.\n There are five individual scenarios in this game, which are not set in chronological order. The first, \"Outbreak\", takes place at the beginning of the outbreak, as the police prepare to destroy the zombie horde using explosives. \"Below Freezing Point\" deals with the events in the former underground laboratory of Umbrella before the events of Resident Evil 2, where a rogue virologist, Monica, attempts to steal bio-weapons research and deal with[clarification needed] her former co-worker, Yoko Suzuki. \"The Hive\" involves the survivors taking refuge in the Raccoon General Hospital, which is also featured in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, while it is under assault from a colony of infected leeches. \"Hellfire\", set the same day as \"Outbreak\", involves a group of survivors fleeing into the Apple Inn hotel that turns out to be on fire and swarming with lickers. The final scenario, \"Decisions, Decisions\", regards the survivors' search for a cure to the G-virus, which sends them to Raccoon City University, where the eight different characters must wisely choose a decision to survive the puzzling secrets hidden in the university; they must then escape the city before it is destroyed.\n According to an interview with producer Noritaka Funamizu, the first concept of Biohazard Outbreak, as it was known originally, was known before the release of Resident Evil 2 in 1998. With growing interest in the concept of network gaming over consoles, Shinji Mikami, the director of the first Resident Evil, suggested to Funamizu that he should have a try. Early on in the design, Funamizu made a small multi-player mini-game in which the player must survive the longest time possible; the team decided to remove it due to its failure to encourage teamwork\u2014players would instinctively run away from the horde and be slaughtered rather than help one another to ensure their own survival. They decided that what made Resident Evil scary was its lack of multiplayer, forcing gamers to play \"on their own\". The team then chose that the game would follow its own story like the other games in the series, but keep the option for multi-player.[7] The game development was later put on hold.\n Prior to 2002, Capcom decided to revive development of the game, based on the research gathered from the first attempt. Production Studio 1 began its development of the game, as opposed to Mikami's Studio 4. In February 2002, a Sony press conference regarding the PlayStation 2 revealed the game\u2014previously unheard-of by the public, it had a working title of Biohazard Online. This led to confusion amongst the audience before Capcom released a statement confirming its existence.[8] Resident Evil Outbreak was a part of an initiative from Capcom's Production Studio 1 to develop three network focused games on the PlayStation 2. The other games were Auto Modellista and Monster Hunter. Capcom's goal was to have at least one of the games reach a million sales. Both Monster Hunter and Resident Evil Outbreak eventually reached this goal.[9]\n The game made an appearance at Sony's conference on May 21 at E3 2002, with a video showcasing real-time 3D backgrounds (as opposed to pre-rendered); revealing four of the characters and demonstrating the ad-lib system and character communication.[10] The \"ad-lib system\" was chosen over conventional microphone chat because the development team argued that it would ruin the atmosphere. Instead, limited chat options were used for conversation between users; a player would walk up to another and deliver a line from a particular conversational category (e.g. \"help\" and \"go\" categories).[7] No solid release date was given at that time.[11]\n Later that year the game was renamed Biohazard Network. By October, eighteen different scenarios were in development, with even more in the concept phase.[7] In November, Capcom released various pieces of media, showing eight playable characters and familiar-scenarios such as \"Flashback\". The occupations of the characters were also given.[12]\n In January 2003, further information was provided, mostly regarding interactive NPCs (non-player characters). Capcom boasted such actions as enemy NPCs who would attack the player and other ones that would run away when approached. Screenshots of \"Flashback\", \"Underbelly\", \"The Hive\" and other scenarios were released.[13]\n By May 2003, the game's title had been changed. This time, it had been changed to Biohazard Outbreak (Resident Evil Outbreak outside Japan),[14] and the number of scenarios was reduced to the five scenarios. Another five scenarios did not make the initial cut, although they were complete enough to be featured in the E3 2002 trailer, and were developed into the sequel Resident Evil Outbreak File #2. In September, doubts were raised as to Outbreak's online game-play in Europe, but Capcom was adamant that it would at least try to find a way to solve the problem in time for release.[15]\n The European release was heavily delayed, finally released in September 2004\u2014nine months after Japan and the United States saw its release. Back in March Capcom had given in on securing Outbreak's network due to the numerous problems faced with establishing a network in a region simultaneously for dozens of languages, and securing service providers; as well as the usual PAL/NTSC] differential.[16]\n Outbreak received a \"C+\" from 1UP.com in their review. The staff referred to it as \"another typical entry in the RE canon\", and as a \"competent game\" with \"controls [that] are actually functional and somewhat intuitive\". However, they cited a number of problems with the game, notably Capcom's choice of not installing voice chat in favor of the ad-lib system. They found the game's five scenarios to be short, and AI partners to be \"chock-full of repetitive and annoying sound bytes\".[19]\n Eurogamer was disappointed with Capcom's failure to establish online support for the European market at a time when the PlayStation 2's online community was threatened with the expected rise in the Xbox's popularity with the upcoming release of Halo 2, stating that an Outbreak was \"designed from the ground up to be a co-operative multiplayer game for four players\" and questioning if a network-less game would be of interest to players. Another problem was with the real-time \"START\" menu, which meant that file-reading and item-trading would make the player vulnerable to a random zombie attack, making the game \"[feel] light in the story department\" as a consequence of not becoming immersed in the environment. Long load times for the PAL version was also noted in the review.[21]\n", " Scott Douglas Sagan (born 1955) is the Caroline S.G.

Bruce G. Blair writes, \"Scott Sagan's book [The Limits of Safety] is nothing less than a tour de force.... It is by far the most carefully researched and painstaking study of nuclear weapons safety ever written.\"[6][7]\n He also is one of the leading pessimist scholars about nuclear proliferation, and his co-authored book with Kenneth Waltz, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed,[8] is widely read and cited in the literature on nuclear weapons. Sagan writes in the book, \"the United States and the Soviet Union survived the cold war and did not use their massive nuclear-weapons arsenals during the period's repeated crises. This should be a cause of celebration and wonder; it should not be an excuse for inaction with either arms control or non-proliferation policies.\"\n His most recent publications include Insider Threats,[9] co-edited with Matthew Bunn (Cornell University Press, 2017); Learning from a Disaster: Improving Nuclear Safety and Security after Fukushima,[10] co-edited with Edward D.

It was founded in 1951, and has its headquarters in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[3] It has branches throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore.\n ABC has 320 million retail customers, 2.7 million corporate clients, and nearly 24,000 branches. It is China's third largest lender by assets. ABC went public in mid-2010, fetching the world's biggest ever initial public offering (IPO) at the time,[4] since overtaken by another Chinese company, Alibaba.[5]   In 2011, it ranked eighth among the Top 1000 World Banks,[6] by 2015, it ranked third in Forbes' 13th annual Global 2000 list[7] and in 2017 it ranked fifth.[8]\n Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. In 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. It was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited.[9] It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.[10]\n In April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history. This occurred when two vault managers at the Handan branch of the bank in Hebei province embezzled almost 51 million yuan (US$7.5 million).[11]\n In 2012, ABC started a project to migrate to the Avaloq Banking System.[12][13]\n During the 2013 Korean crisis, the Agricultural Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[14]\n ABC was the last of the \"big four\" banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[15] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[16] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[17] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[5]\n ABC raised US$19.21 billion in an IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai on July 6, 2010, before overallotment options were exercised.[18] On August 13, 2010, ABC officially completed the world's largest initial public offering, raising a total of $22.1 billion after both Shanghai and Hong Kong's over-allotments were fully exercised.[19][20] The IPO was once thought to be able to raise US$30 billion, but weaker market sentiment dampened the value.[21] Despite a 15-month low for the Chinese benchmark index, the IPO was said to have gone smoothly.[22]\n CICC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley led the Hong Kong offering, with JPMorgan, Macquarie, Deutsche Bank and ABC's own securities unit also involved. CICC, Citic Securities, Galaxy and Guotai Junan Securities handled the Shanghai portion. ABC sold about 40% of the Shanghai offering to 27 strategic investors including China Life Insurance and China State Construction. They were subject to lock-up periods of 12\u201318 months. Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for its Hong Kong share offering, including Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, taking a combined $5.45 billion worth of shares.[23]\n  Media related to Agricultural Bank of China at Wikimedia Commons\n", " \n \"Manhunt\" is the 19th episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, the 45th episode overall, originally broadcast on June\u00a019, 1989.\n In this episode, the Enterprise must transport delegates to a conference, one of whom is an extremely man-hungry Lwaxana Troi with eyes for Captain Picard.\n Drummer Mick Fleetwood from the British rock band Fleetwood Mac plays an Antedean dignitary in this episode.\n The Federation starship Enterprise, under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, is ordered to escort two Antedean ambassadors to an important conference to take place on the planet Pacifica. The Antedeans are transported aboard in a self-induced catatonic state\u2014to reduce the stress of space travel\u2014along with a plentiful food supply for when they awaken, in accordance with their custom.\n En route, the Enterprise is ordered to rendezvous with a shuttlecraft carrying the Betazoid telepath ambassador Lwaxana Troi, mother of ship's counselor Deanna Troi, and her mute manservant Mr. Homn. Due to his previous experience with her (see \"Haven\"), Picard does not entirely welcome Lwaxana's presence, as she tends to be overbearing and lack tact, but Starfleet's instructions are that she be afforded full diplomatic courtesy. Lwaxana invites Picard to dinner, and he is surprised to find that rather than the formal diplomatic function for the entire senior staff that he expected, it is a romantic setting for just the two of them. Picard manages to evade her advances, inviting android Lieutenant Commander Data to join them, and manipulating him into taking over the conversation with long-winded anecdotes.\n Troi explains that her mother has entered \"The Phase\": a stage in the life of a middle-aged Betazoid woman when her sex drive drastically increases, albeit clouding her judgment, and that she is searching for a new husband (having been long-since widowed). Picard chooses to retreat to the Holodeck to hide from her, leaving Commander Riker in charge. Frustrated by Picard's mysterious absence, Lwaxana chooses to target Riker instead, and apparently ignoring the possibility that her daughter still has feelings for him, makes a surprise announcement to the bridge crew that they will be married.\n Following this development, and as the Antedeans have meanwhile been revived, Riker goes to the holodeck to notify Picard. Lwaxana follows, and having determined that Riker is not interested either, switches her attention to a character from Picard's Dixon Hill simulation, who returns her affections, forcing Picard to somewhat reluctantly inform her that her new husband-to-be is merely a holographic projection.\n When the ship arrives at the conference and collected ambassadors prepare to beam down to the planet, Lwaxana offhandedly informs the crew that the Antedeans are actually assassins. Though they vehemently deny this, scans immediately show that they are carrying explosives, just as Lwaxana indicated, and they are taken into custody. She remarks that while she did not manage to find a new husband, at least she saved the conference, and as she is beaming away, playfully chastises Picard for having \"such naughty thoughts\" about her, much to his dismay.\n \"Manhunt\" received a Nielsen rating of 8.9 and a ranking of 3 making it, according to the Nielsen system, towards the lower end of views for a first run Star Trek: The Next Generation episode[1] In 2019, Den of Geek noted this episode for including an awkward romance between Picard and Lwaxana Troi.[2]\n In a ranking of every Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, \"Manhunt\" was ranked 156th by Medium in 2016.[3]\n Variety magazine notes the heavily costumed role by Mick Fleetwood, a musician famous for being part of the Fleetwood Mac band.[4] In the episode he has the role of a fish-like Anteaden alien.[4]\n", " Kharestan-e Sofla (Persian: \u062e\u0627\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0641\u0644\u064a\u200e, also Romanized as Kh\u0101rest\u0101n-e Sofl\u00e1; also known as Kh\u0101r s\u016bn Sofl\u00e1)[1] is a village in Howmeh Rural District, in the Central District of Behbahan County, Khuzestan Province, Iran.

Until recently the three species were believed to be closely related and were placed in a single genus, Hemitragus. Genetic studies have proven that the three tahrs are not as closely related as previously thought. Now they are considered as members of three separate monotypic genera; Hemitragus is now reserved for the Himalayan Tahr; Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri Tahr; and Arabitragus for the Arabian Tahr.[1]\n While the Arabian Tahr of Oman and the Nilgiri Tahr of South India both have small ranges and are considered endangered, the Himalayan Tahr remains relatively widespread in the Himalayas, and has been introduced to the Southern Alps of New Zealand where it is hunted recreationally.

Arafat and al-Wazir, who lobbied for increased personal responsibility, primarily faced opposition from al-Hassan who opposed premature military action against Israel which the former two advocated.[1]\n The establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964 severely undermined Fatah, with 80% of its members joining the PLO's armed wing, the Palestinian Liberation Army. With this, Arafat and al-Wazir convinced the central committee to allow military operations. As a result, al-Assifa was formed as Fatah's armed wing, but Arafat's rival Abu Youssef was appointed its leader. In 1965, Arafat was chosen to replace him, but eventually began facing opposition from the central committee. Al-Hassan led the committee to cut funds to al-Assifa in an attempt to reduce its operations,[1] but Arafat decided to relocate to Damascus, Syria where he received financial aid from Palestinians working abroad.[2]\n In the 1989 Fatah Conference, 18 Fatah members were elected to the committee, with Arafat as the secretary-general. Following Arafat's signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, only half of the central committee became leading members in the newly established Palestinian National Authority. The rest of the committee either resigned or became inactive. Although now he had overwhelming support from the central committee, Arafat decided to restructure it to further strengthen his authority in the Palestinian territories. He convened a conference in Gaza in October 1995, in which he added to the committee \"insiders\" Zakaria al-Agha and Faisal Husseini. In November, the committee set up councils to organize campaigns for the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections and threatened to expel any Fatah member who ran as an independent.[3]\n Elections for the central committee were held on July 8, 2009, with 96 candidates competing for spots.

The U-boat was laid down on 9 July 1944 at the Schichau-Werke yard at Danzig, launched on 25 August 1944, and commissioned on 7 October 1944 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Horst Willner.[1]\n Like all Type XXI U-boats, U-3505 had a displacement of 1,621 tonnes (1,595 long tons) when at the surface and 1,819 tonnes (1,790 long tons) while submerged.

When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of 6.1 knots (11.3\u00a0km/h; 7.0\u00a0mph). When submerged, the boat could operate at 5 knots (9.3\u00a0km/h; 5.8\u00a0mph) for 340 nautical miles (630\u00a0km; 390\u00a0mi); when surfaced, she could travel 15,500 nautical miles (28,700\u00a0km; 17,800\u00a0mi) at 10 knots (19\u00a0km/h; 12\u00a0mph).[2] U-3505 was fitted with six 53.3\u00a0cm (21.0\u00a0in) torpedo tubes in the bow and four 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) C/30 anti-aircraft guns. She could carry twenty-three torpedoes or seventeen torpedoes and twelve mines. The complement was five officers and fifty-two men.[2]\n Although never used in combat, the submarine achieved some degree of fame due to a rescue mission. Her commander, Captain Horst Willner, disguised his wife as a sailor and smuggled her aboard together with their three-month-old baby (a crime punishable by death). The captain's family was originally to be evacuated on MV\u00a0Wilhelm Gustloff, joining a flood of refugees fleeing East Prussia ahead of the advancing Red Army, in \"Operation Hannibal\". Willner cancelled their places and took them onto his submarine, and so probably saved their lives since Gustloff was sunk by the Soviet submarine\u00a0S-13 with the greatest loss of life in maritime history.\n After leaving Danzig they went to Gotenhafen, where they took on board 110 children and adolescents. The refugees, including the captain's family, were safely delivered at Travem\u00fcnde, L\u00fcbeck, on 2 April 1945.\n Returning to Kiel, U-3505 was to participate in torpedo exercises, but on 3 April was sunk in a bombing raid while in harbour.

Tolkien's inaugural O'Donnell Memorial Lecture of October 21, 1955. The lecture sheds light on Tolkien's conceptions of the connections of race, ethnicity, and language.\n It was first published in Angles and Britons in 1963, and then was later republished in The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays.[1]\n Tolkien begins with an overview of the terms \"British\", \"Celtic\", \"Germanic\", \"Saxon\", \"English\" and \"Welsh\", explaining the last term's etymology in walha.\n Tolkien also addresses the historical language contact between English and Welsh since the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, including Welsh loanwords and substrate influence found in English, and conversely English loanwords in Welsh. Comparing the Germanic i-mutation and the Celtic affection, Tolkien says:\n The north-west of Europe, in spite of its underlying differences of linguistic heritage \u2013 Goidelic, Brittonic, Gallic; its varieties of Germanic; and the powerful intrusion of spoken Latin \u2013 is as it were a single philological province, a region so interconnected in race, culture, history, and linguistic fusions that its departmental philologies cannot flourish in isolation.\n In the final part of the lecture, Tolkien explores the concept of phonaesthetics, citing the phrase cellar door as a recognized beautiful-sounding phrase in English, adding that to his own taste, in Welsh \"cellar doors are extraordinarily frequent\". Tolkien describes the working of phonaesthetics inherent in the moment of association of sound and meaning:\n [T]his pleasure is felt most immediately and acutely in the moment of association: that is in the reception (or imagination) of a word-form which is felt to have a certain style, and the attribution to it of a meaning which is not received through it.\n Tolkien alludes to his view that such tastes are inherited, \"an aspect in linguistic terms of our individual natures. And since these are largely historical products, the predilections must be so too.\" To refer to such an inherited taste of language, Tolkien introduces the term \"native tongue\" as opposed to \"cradle tongue\".\n Tolkien notes in his lecture that \"Most English-speaking people \u2026 will admit that 'cellar door' is beautiful, especially if dissociated from its sense and from its spelling. More beautiful than, say, 'sky', and far more beautiful than 'beautiful' \u2026 Well then, in Welsh, for me cellar doors are extraordinarily frequent\". This heavy interest in and appreciation of Welsh influenced his own languages, notably his elvish languages like Sindarin and Quenya.[2]\n This lecture is considered Tolkien's \"last major learned work\".[3] There were several important aspects to it: firstly, it \"includes a valuable contribution to the study of the place of Britons in Anglo-Saxon England\", secondly, a warning against racial theories, thirdly, a hypothesis of \"inborn\" linguistic tastes which then leads into a discussion of his own views of aesthetics in language, and finally, it provided a (correct) hypothesis on the origins of the word \"w(e)alh\", which in turn provided an explanation of what happened to Celtic when the Anglo-Saxons invaded.[4]\n", " Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (Prinzessin Marie Viktoria Feodore Leopoldine von Hessen und bei Rhein, 24 May 1874 \u2013 16 November 1878), was a German Hessian and Rhenish child princess. She was the youngest child and fifth daughter of Ludwig IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse and his first wife Princess Alice of the United Kingdom. Her mother was the second daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. She died of diphtheria at the age of four and was buried with her mother, who died a few weeks later of the same disease. She and Queen Victoria shared the same birthday.\n She had six older siblings, Victoria, Elizabeth, Irene, Ernest, Friedrich, and Alix. \nShe was given the names Marie Viktoria Feodore Leopoldine after her maternal grandmother and uncle, the haemophilic Prince Leopold, and possibly the Tsarevna of Russia, Marie Feodorovna, who was also Alix's godmother and future mother in law. \nMarie was known as \"May\" in the family. When she was a baby, her mother remarked in a letter that \"little sister Maly\" bore a strong resemblance to her dead brother Friedrich (\"Frittie\") at the same age \"with such quick eyes and two deep dimples in her cheeks.\" A few weeks later, Alice wrote that baby \"Maly\" had fair skin, light brown hair and deep blue eyes. As she grew older, she smiled frequently and Alice thought she more strongly resembled her older sister Victoria, with \"fair hair, marked eyebrows and speaking eyes.\" She and her sister Alix, two years older, \"made a pretty contrast.\" Her mother thought her youngest child was \"enchanting\" and as a toddler the little girl called her mother \"my 'weetheart.\"[1][page\u00a0needed] Alix was her constant companion. The two girls were dressed alike and shared the nursery.[2] The family enjoyed a trip to the  seaside in the summer of 1877 and the two youngest girls were a source of delight to their mother. Sending photos taken then to her mother, Queen Victoria, Alice wrote that \"May has not such fat cheeks in reality; still it is very dear. The two little girlies are so sweet, so dear, merry, and nice. I don't know which is dearest, they are both so captivating.\"[3][page\u00a0needed]\n Tragedy struck the Grand Ducal family in 1878. As her sister Victoria described the scene later, the family had been gathered together on the evening of 5 November when she developed a stiff neck. Victoria reported her symptoms to their mother, who thought it might be mumps and said it would be \"comical\" if they all caught it. Victoria felt well enough to read Alice in Wonderland to her younger siblings, while her mother sat nearby chatting with her friend Katie Macbean, who was filling in for an absent lady-in-waiting. Marie leaped up and begged her mother to let her have more cake. Her siblings asked Miss Macbean to play the piano so they could dance. They danced for half an hour and went to bed in high spirits.\n  The next morning Victoria was diagnosed with diphtheria; at three in the morning on 12 November, six-year-old Alix was diagnosed with the disease. Princess Alice ordered a steam inhaler be brought to her room to prevent the seriously ill Alix from choking to death. Hours later, Princess Marie ran into her mother's room, crawled into bed with her and kissed her. By afternoon, Marie as well was displaying the symptoms of the disease, suffering from a high fever. White spots and a white membrane covered the back of her throat. The next day her sister Irene became ill and on the day of 14 November her brother Ernest and father Louis also became ill with diphtheria. Alice and the doctors nursed the family round the clock. On the morning of 16 November, Marie choked to death from the membrane covering her throat. Her mother, awakened by the doctors, hurried to the nursery, only to find her daughter dead. Alice sat by her daughter's body, kissing Marie's face and hands, trying to work up the strength to tell her ill husband. She watched as Marie's coffin was wheeled off to the family mausoleum.\n For weeks, Alice concealed Marie's death from the other sick children, who asked about her and tried to send their little sister toys. Elizabeth, who had been sent to stay with her paternal grandmother, was the only child who escaped infection. The sick children were finally told at the beginning of December that Marie had died. Ten-year-old Ernest at first refused to believe the news and then broke down in tears. His mother hugged and kissed him, despite the risk of infection. On 7 December Alice recognized the symptoms of diphtheria in herself. She died on the morning of 14 December, murmuring \"From Friday to Saturday -- four weeks -- May -- dear Papa.\"[4] Alice was interred  beside her daughter. A statue by Joseph Boehm was placed on the tomb of Alice holding Marie in her arms.[5]\n It is commonly believed that Marie's niece, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, the third daughter of Alix and her husband Nikolai II of Russia, was named for her and the Dowager Empress of Russia, Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark).\n", " Bugallon, officially the Municipality of Bugallon, (Pangasinan: Baley na Bugallon; Ilokano: Ili ti Bugallon; Tagalog: Bayan ng Bugallon), is a 2nd class municipality in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 67,348 people.[3][6]\n The municipality of Bugallon was formerly called \"Salasa\" (meaning floor joist in the dialect, a part of a wooden house where the floor is attached to). In the Spanish colonial era, the Spanish authorities established the town center in Poblacion (now Barangay Salasa). Because of the 1914 massive flooding and erosion, the town center was later transferred to Barrio Anagao (became Barangay Poblacion) but the Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, one of the oldest churches in the country, could not be transferred (every time someone attempts, he dies). A new Catholic church was created in the Poblacion, the Saint Andrew Catholic Church. This is the reason why Bugallon has two Catholic Churches (one in Salasa and the other in Anagao).\n Fr. Antonio Perez. founded Salasa (1714-1747)  In 1720, Poblacion was in Barangay Polong's Don Francisco Valencerina yard, later transferred later to Baranggay Salasa on January 24, 1734 by Fr. Fernando Garcia. The Plaza, Presedencia, the church and convent, were engineered by the Frayle (surrounded by parallel calles). Do\u00f1a Milagros Klar, wife of then manager of Pantranco (Philtranco) donated in 1935, the Our Lady of Lourdes statue to Salasa Shrine.\n The town was named after the town's hero Major Jose Torres Bugallon who fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna during the Philippine\u2013American War in 1899. February 5, 1899, at the Battle of La Loma, Bugallon faced Gen. Arthur MacArthur. Bugallon suffered a shot to the thigh during the battle. Later that day, in the arms of Antonio Luna, Bugallon died from excessive loss of blood.[7]\n In 1921, the town of Salasa was renamed to Bugallon. Mr. Canullas founded the Jose Torres Bugallonas association and a monument was erected in the plaza, wherein the bones of General Bugallon were interred thereat on January 12, 1958.[8]\n The act of changing Salasa an old town to a new one, Bugallon, required a congressional approval sponsored by the Congressman Mauro Navarro, first district of Pangasinan, and obtained congressional approval in changing Salasa to Bugallon. Hence, Salasa became a mere barangay but remains the seat of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish (11 barangays) and the other is Bugallon's St. Andrew the Apostle (14 barangay).\n Bugallon's Chief Executives are Mayor Priscilla \u201cMely\u201d Ignacio Espino (wife of former governor Amado Espino) and Vice Mayor Winston P.

Dominador Mendoza, Jr., Population of 57,445.[20] It is part of the Vicariate of Our Lady of Lourdes, under Vicar Forane, Father Raymond R. Oligane[21]\n St. Andrew the Apostle Parish was originally erected at Salasa (founded by the Dominicans in the 18th century). When the town site was transferred, the seat of the parish was also transferred as a consequence brought about by natural calamities that battered the area.\n The 1914 Salasa floods destroyed crops, properties, buildings, the church and convent. Poblacion was transferred to Barangay Anagao (Bugallon), under Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Andrew the Apostle remained the patron Saint in July 1920 with 1st Parish Priest, Fr. Eustaquio Ocampo, then,  Fr. Montano Domingo on November 29, 1921 and on June 1928, Fr Emeterio Domagas succeeded.\n On May 23, 1929, Pangasinan was created as a new Diocese and Msgr. Cesar Maria Guerrero became Pangasinan's First Bishop onn May 23, 1929. In 1930, Franciscan Capuchin appointed Fr. Cesario of Legario and Fr. Fernando of Erasum to Bugallon and Salasa, respectively on September 17, 1930. The Salasa Church, one of the biggest in Philippines, 100 meters long was completely destroyed and despoiled by Bugallon natives. Fr. Benjamin of Ilarduya became Kura Paroko from October 16, 1933 to June 27, 1941. The church brick-structure and the old fa\u00e7ade were built. During World War II,  Fr.

During World War II, Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff worked as a mathematician in the In 7/VI, that was the signals intelligence agency of the Wehrmacht and worked with  Fritz Menzer on the testing of cryptographic devices and procedures. Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff worked specifically on the testing of the m-40 cipher machine. His most important contributions to the history of logic and mathematics was his studies and descriptions from 1957, of the calculating machine, built by Wilhelm Schickard.[2]\n Bruno von Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff was an aristocrat and a member of the noble house of Frydag. \n After attending lectures in mathematics, physics, musicology and philosophy at the Universities of Greifswald and Munich, Freytag earned his doctorate in Philosophy in Greifswald in 1936 and habilitated in 1944 in Freiburg im Breisgau and 1947 in T\u00fcbingen after taking part in the war. From 1955, Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff was Professor of Philosophy at the University of T\u00fcbingen. In 1957 he reconstructed the first calculating machine of 1623, which was handed down only in scanty sketches, of the T\u00fcbingen astronomy professor Wilhelm Schickard. He also built the data sticks from Schickard. After his retirement in 1977 Freytag studied the structures of the still new PCs.\n During the Third German Congress of Philosophy in October 1950, Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff presented a series of theses to the Symposium, where he argued that the various logical systems were not pure but that each of them includes a pure kernel that could be identified, and separated out. The kernel could be considered pure philosophical logic, i.e. logic tout court which is characterized by its properties, that is identity, contradiction and their interweaving (German: Verflechtung). Although there were many logical calculi, he considered pure logic to be unique and that diverse logical systems are mathematical systems that must be interpreted with the aid of pure logic. For Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff:\n Logical calculi begin from elements which require analysis through pure logic. He considered the most fundamental element in logisitic is judgment (German: Urteil), the most fundamental element in logic is concept, (German: Begriff). Pure philosophical logic is a closed, self-contained, system, without fundamental flaws and of great beauty and wide applicability, and attacks against classical logic are largely unjustified. Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff was a staunch proponent of Aristotelian logic.[2] His views were challenged by J\u00f3zef Maria Boche\u0144ski, Paul Bernays and B\u00e9la Juhos, who were also at the Symposium. Haskell Curry constructed a logical model that he used to contest Freytag-L\u00f6ringhoff theses.[2]\n His most important contribution to logic was the study, that started in 1979, of the calculating machine of Wilhelm Schickard. During his lifetime, he constructed several models, one of which he kept at his home.[2]\n", " Wypych\u00f3w [v\u0268\u02c8p\u0268xuf] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Zel\u00f3w, within Be\u0142chat\u00f3w County, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, in central Poland.[1] It lies approximately 6 kilometres (4\u00a0mi) south-west of Zel\u00f3w, 16\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) north-west of Be\u0142chat\u00f3w, and 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) south-west of the regional capital \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\n The village has a population of 260.\n \n Coordinates: 51\u00b025\u203233.8\u2033N 19\u00b009\u203239.3\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.426056\u00b0N 19.160917\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.426056; 19.160917\n \n", " Claude Moss\u00e9 (born 1924) is a French historian specialising in the history of Ancient Greece.\n Moss\u00e9 was born the daughter of a wine merchant in Paris.

The plant Vaccinium mjoebergii J.J.Sm. was named after him,[1] as were Mjoberg's toadlet (Uperoleia mjobergii ),[2] the grasshopper Goniaea mjoebergi, the crab Uca mjoebergi, Mj\u00f6berg's forest dragon (Gonocephalus mjobergi ),[3] the Atherton Tableland skink (Glaphyromorphus mjobergi ),[3] Mj\u00f6berg's bush frog (Philautus mjobergi ),[2] and Mj\u00f6berg's dwarf litter frog (Leptobrachella mjobergi ).[2]\n Mj\u00f6berg was born in \u00c5s, Halland County, Sweden. He gained a licentiate at the Stockholm University in 1908, and his doctorate at Lund University in 1912.\n Mj\u00f6berg led expeditions to North West Australia in 1910/11, and to Queensland in 1912/13. He worked for the Deli Experimental Station at Medan in Sumatra from 1919 to 1922, and was curator of the Sarawak State Museum in Borneo from 1922 until 1924. He also worked in various museums in Sweden.\n He was employed by the State Entomological Institution from 1903 to 1906 and at the National Museum at different times between 1903 and 1910 during which time he was a master at several higher schools in Stockholm from 1907 until 1909, and travelled in Sweden for study purposes through 1902 to 1909 before he led expeditions to Australia. A lecture tour in the USA lasted from 1916 to 1917 after which he was Swedish consul in Sumatra in 1920 among other postings and a study period in the US from 1921 to 1925.[4]\n In the early 1900s Mj\u00f6berg set off to the Kimberley region of Western Australia in an attempt to prove his Darwinian human evolution theory. What he did not know was that his expedition would have dire repercussions for years to follow for indigenous Australians, and for himself. In Western Australia, Mj\u00f6berg became obsessed with the Aboriginal people, and what started off as collecting native flora and fauna for research, soon led to the desecration of sacred burial grounds and the smuggling of human remains back to Sweden.[5]\n Historians have described Mj\u00f6berg as aggressive, arrogant and devious, a leader who made enemies with local Aboriginal people, pastoralists and even his own scientific team.[6]\n After 1911, he made a second expedition to Australia's east coast: Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, removing one set of remains from each.\n The 1915 publication of his diaries about the 1910 expedition exposed his unethical and illegal collection of material from Australia. Most of the material kept in Sweden's Museum of Ethnography was brought there between 1910 and 1911. Swedish anthropologist Claes Hallgren of Dalarna University wrote the book Two Travellers \u2013 Two Pictures of Australia, examining Mjoberg's methods, prompting an ethical debate that led the Swedish Government to contact the Australian authorities. Ninety years after their removal, his great-niece Lotte Mj\u00f6berg, a journalist in Stockholm, initiated the return of skeletons to the Aboriginal people in September 2004.[7][8] Aboriginal elders travelled to Stockholm to receive the remains and start the process of spiritual healing. Spokesman for the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Culture Centre, Neil Carter said: \"The belief is that once a burial ground has been disturbed, the spirits and the country will not rest until the remains have been brought back.\"[8] Aborigines believe that the spirit of the departed cannot go on into the afterlife if the bones are disturbed. Eighteen boxes containing bones, believed to include the skeletons of two small children, were sent to the National Museum of Australia for identification before being interred at their traditional lands.[8]\n Taking them without permission, Mj\u00f6berg passed them off as kangaroo bones to get them out of the country. His attitude was representative of the Social Darwinism of the times according to Dr Hallgren, who writes that the popular \"Gothic Horror\" presentation, and demonising Aborigines was the context and \"justification\" for Mj\u00f6berg's hunting for skeletons.

Several critics felt its production was reminiscent of Meghan Trainor's sound. Lyrically, \"Smile\" conveys a positive message \"about loving and appreciating yourself and doing all the simple things in your life to make yourself smile and be ultimately happy.\"[1] The song received mixed reviews from critics; some complimented its fun pop sound, while others criticised the simple production and Im for following Trainor's sound.\n Upon its release, \"Smile\" debuted at number 48 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, number 55 on the South Korea Gaon International Download Chart and number 63 on the South Korea Gaon International Digital Chart. The accompanying music video features Im performing random acts of kindness as she gives out flowers, balloons, free coffee and drinks to people in the streets of Sydney, and visits a nursing home and childcare centre. Fans noted that the video's concept was similar to country duo O'Shea's video for their song \"Bad Day Good\" (2014).

You gotta shake it up, you gotta hold it down, you gotta do all the things that make you smile.\"[1]\n Josep Vinaixa of Ultimate Music described \"Smile\" as \"a cute pop production\".[14] Jessica Morris of Fdrmx.com gave the song 4.2 stars out of five and wrote that Im \"delivers a high-energy performance that will put a smile on your face and give you that extra 'oomph' in the day. While it's not hugely climatic, 'Smile' is a fun diddy that puts other bubble-gum pop to shame with Im's superb talent.\"[11] Thomasbleach.com called it an \"infectious pop track\" that \"shows a fun and carefree side\" to Im, further adding that \"you can't help but bop along and smile\".[1] The website also felt that the song is \"a bit too 'kid friendly' that it almost sounds like it belongs on a Wiggles album\".[1] Auspop gave \"Smile\" a mixed review, stating that the track \"leaves us cold...for some reason it feels to us like her label's decided, 'hey, Meghan Trainor's sound's working right now, let's get ourselves a slice of that'.\"[13]\n Another mixed review came from Andja Curcic of Renowned for Sound, who gave \"Smile\" two-and-a-half stars out of five. She called it a \"disappointing\" and \"silly song\" with \"uninspired and simplistic\" lyrics, further adding that it \"barely showcases\" Im's big vocal range and does not have a \"memorable quality\" or \"bring a fresh twist\" to the throwback genre. Curcic concluded, \"I really hope Im backs away from this genre and starts to build her way back to some great music.\"[12] For the week ending 6 June 2015, \"Smile\" debuted at number 55 on the South Korea Gaon International Download Chart with sales of 3,896 copies, and number 63 on the South Korea Gaon International Digital Chart.[15][16] In Australia, \"Smile\" debuted at number 48 on the ARIA Singles Chart for the week dated 8 June 2015, and only spent one week on that chart.

This is what happened.\" It then shows the question \"What Makes You Smile?\", followed by scenes of Im in the kitchen making muffins. She then visits a nursing home and gives out muffins to the residents before she sings and dances with them. This is followed by scenes of Im in the streets handing out free coffee and drinks to parents and their children. Im is then seen handing out flowers to people and taking photos with them. Afterwards, she visits a childcare centre and reads a story to the children and then dances with them. The video then shows Im volunteering to walk dogs in the park. She later visits a party shop where she blows up smiley face balloons and gives them out to people in the streets. The video then ends with a shot of a smiley face balloon.[19]\n Following the video's release, some fans noted that its concept was similar to the video for country duo O'Shea's song \"Bad Day Good\" (2014). O'Shea's video also features random acts of kindness as the duo are seen walking around a town paying for people's petrol and parking. When asked by The Daily Telegraph's Sydney Confidential about the similarities between the two videos, Im stated: \"I had no idea something similar had been done. I just wanted to do something a bit different, and something that I wasn't in a costume or playing a character. I just wanted to be myself.\"[20] Within four days of its release, the video for \"Smile\" had already received more than 16,000 views.[20]\n To celebrate the release of \"Smile\", Im launched a #MakeYouSmile social campaign to bring happiness to people through small gestures of kindness. She encouraged her fans and the wider public to do the same.[2][8] The single's release and music video were promoted on Sunrise on 29 May 2015.[21] Im also promoted \"Smile\" with a television interview on The Daily Edition (29 May 2015)[22] and radio interviews on Fifi & Dave and 3AW (15 June 2015).[23][24] She performed and signed physical copies of \"Smile\" for fans during instore appearances at Westfield Chatswood (30 May 2015)[25] and Westfield Burwood (20 June 2015),[26] and performed an acoustic version on the breakfast radio show Matt & Jane (12 June 2015).[27] Im performed \"Smile\" with the Sydney Street Choir at the Sydney Opera House on 22 July 2015.[28]\n \n \n Credits adapted from the CD single liner notes.[4]\n", " Women's Center of Rhode Island (WCRI) is a domestic violence organization and safe house serving women and children in Providence and East Providence, Rhode Island.

This was mostly due to the four years since Goodrem's last solo single, \"I Can't Break It to My Heart\" (2008). \"Sitting on Top of the World\" is about Goodrem \"feeling like herself\" again and feeling connected to the world through music/friendship.[3]\n \"Sitting on Top of the World\" was written by Goodrem and co-written and produced by John Shanks.[1] Lyrically, it talks about stars aligning and being together as one.[4] \"So get up, stand up / What you waiting for?\" she happily commands.[4] \"We gotta live life, give in to begin / We've got a love like no one knows!\" she sings on the power pop track.[1]\n Brad Stern wrote for an MTV Buzzworthy article that the song is \"a swoon-filled, carefree pop ditty.\"[4] In another review, Stern wrote for MuuMuse that \"probably the most fun, feel good, warm 'n' fuzzy on the inside bout of euphoria you'll feel since that last time you were tripping out on MDMA.\"[1] He also praised her \"sublime vocals\", the \"powerhouse instrumentation\" and called it \"an absolutely massive smash.\"[1] In Australia, \"Sitting on Top of the World\" debuted and peaked at number two on the ARIA Charts, being held off the top spot by Carly Rae Jepsen's \"Call Me Maybe\".[5] It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 140,000 copies.

Goodrem herself stated in the behind-the-scenes video on YouTube that it is about how you may get distracted from your main focus in life, but you will always end up where you belong in the end. About \"seeing signs, wanting to be in the right place at the right time\". The balloons symbolize various paths she has taken over her own life and listeners have taken in their own lives.[8]\n The video features Goodrem and a lot of dancers twirling around in a giant field like fanciful forest creatures while holding balloons.

The district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Minneapolis Historic District, is bounded by Second Avenue South, 31st Street, Third Avenue South and 32nd Street.  The houses are readily visible from the Lake Street exit off Interstate 35W.  The district represents the most intact and concentrated example of Queen Anne style houses by a single builder in Minneapolis.[2]\n The majority of homes on this block were built by Theron P. Healy, a Minneapolis home builder.  He moved to Minneapolis in 1884 and decided to capitalize on the rapidly growing areas of south Minneapolis, which had been made accessible by streetcars on Nicollet Avenue South and 31st Street.  He was the only builder to concentrate on the Queen Anne style in Minneapolis, working between 1886 and 1898.  He was a Master Builder, a builder who also designed the homes he built.  In addition to building homes on this block, Healy built Queen Anne homes in the Lowry Hill area and elsewhere in south Minneapolis.[2]\n The Queen Anne style was popularized in the United States after the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876.  The characteristics of this style include front-facing or cross-gabled rooflines, multiple building materials, trellised balconies, triptychs, window embellishments and stained glass transoms.  Healy's designs included these characteristics, but he often included additional details such as brightly colored art glass transoms, semicircular openings underneath the gables, or off-center entrances.

On leaving the navy, he joined the staff of Southampton F.C. as assistant secretary to Ernest Arnfield, taking over as secretary on Arnfield's retirement.\n Following Jimmy McIntyre's surprise resignation as a manager in December 1924, Goss assumed responsibility for team affairs under the supervision of the board of directors for the remainder of the season, continuing into the following season until Arthur Chadwick took over the manager's position in October 1925. During the period when he was acting as manager, the Saints embarked on a run in the FA Cup, defeating Liverpool in round 4, to reach the semi-final at Stamford Bridge, where they were defeated 2-0 by Sheffield United on 28 March 1925. In the semi-final Tom Parker had a dreadful afternoon, first scoring an own-goal, then suffering a rare miss from the penalty spot (shooting straight at the 'keeper) before a mix-up between him and goalkeeper Tommy Allen gave Sheffield their second goal.\n In June 1936, the club was suffering severe financial difficulties, and the entire board of directors resigned. The new board of directors asked manager George Kay to leave in order to trim the payroll, and in August Kay moved on to Liverpool, taking long-serving trainer Bert Shelley with him. Goss then combined the roles of secretary and manager, with club captain Johnny McIlwaine taking on the role of assistant manager.\n Following the upheavals in the boardroom, the club was able to raise sufficient finances to purchase new players, most prominent of whom was the former Irish international forward Jimmy Dunne who was signed from Arsenal for \u00a31000.\n The 1936\u201337 season was not an outstanding success and Saints struggled to avoid relegation from Division 2.

On the outbreak of World War II he re-joined the Royal Navy, taking command of a minesweeper before settling in Australia.\n", " \n Stothert & Pitt were a British engineering company founded in 1785 in Bath, England. They were the builders of a variety of engineering products ranging from Dock cranes to construction plant and household cast iron items. They went out of business in 1989. The name and intellectual property became part of Clarke Chapman.\n The company was founded by George Stothert (n.b. early on the name is sometimes rendered as Stoddard or Stodhert) in 1785[1] having taken over Thomas Harris's ironmonger's business. He was an agent for Abraham Darby I's Coalbrookdale Iron Company, selling all types of domestic ironmongery. By 1815 they set up their own foundry as Abraham Darby had opened his own warehouse in Bristol. The company was now managed by his son, also George. In 1851 they exhibited a hand crane at the Great Exhibition.\n In 1837, Henry Stothert, brother of the younger George, set up an ironworks in Bristol, first as Henry Stothert & Co., then, joined by Edward Slaughter, Stothert, Slaughter & Co.  Slaughter had earlier formed Slaughter & Co. at his Avonside Ironworks, later and better known as Avonside.  This works produced some substantial iron engineering including a swivel bridge over the river Frome, several of the first engines for Brunel's Great Western Railway and the Bristol and Exeter Railway, as well as 14 engines for the Brighton and South Coast Railway.\n Robert Pitt became an apprentice with Stothert in Bath in 1834 to 1840. In 1840-41 he was working as a draughtsman for Stothert, Slaughter & Co. in Bristol but was back in Bath from 1841 to 1842 helping with the establishment of Stothert's Newark Street Foundry. In 1844 Pitt became a partner with Stotherts along with a second partner Rayno, sometimes referred to as Stothert, Rayno & Pitt, the firm was usually, simply, called Stotherts. In 1855 it became Stothert and Pitt, in 1883 a limited company and in 1902 the firm became a limited company[1]\n In the period from the 1840s to 1900 the Bath company expanded rapidly.  Moving from earlier premises on the north side of the river Avon, to the Newark Street Works on the south-side, then, developing the Victoria Works in the 1890s which filled the valley between the river and the Lower Bristol Road.  Some early work by Stothert can still be seen on the Kennett & Avon Canal in Bath, where two very elegant iron bridges span the canal with the Stothert name on them.  However, it was in the 1840's that the firm began to develop the cranes which eventually were to make them a world name in crane building.\n \nThe earliest surviving crane which was probably made by Stothert can be found at Carmarthen and dates from about 1850, but it bears no name plate. The oldest crane bearing the Stothert & Pitt name was used in Box quarries and probably dates from the 1860's, it was designed to lift 6 tons and sits in a garden in Box. The company began to make its name in the world of large scale crane manufacture when in 1869 the made a Titan crane for setting 27-ton blocks during construction of the Manora Point breakwater, Karachi ('Kurrachee'). Tested with 40-ton load in Bath, September 1869 [9].    They then built a 35 ton Fairbairn steam crane for Bristol docks in 1876, to an improved design by William Fairbairn. The boiler maker's plate reads \"Marshall Sons & Co. Ltd., Engineers, Gainsboro, England, No.92766\". In 1876 they supplied a blocksetting crane to Colombo Harbour Works, Ceylon for breakwater works. Stothert and Pitt; 17/30-ton non rotative, sidesetter. \n Building rail cranes for export to the colonies.\n Stothert and Pitt supplied their earliest electric powered crane to Southampton Dock Authority in 1892. Electric power provided several advantages: powerful motors could be placed in each crane and powered centrally, without requiring a separate prime mover (i.e. steam engine and boiler) in each crane. The crane mechanisms were also lighter, allowing them to be placed on raised carriages that could then straddle a railway freight line- the portal crane. Rather than requiring a bare strip of unused quayside between the railway line and the harbour wall to leave space for cranes, the railway could now be brought right to the dock edge. Cranes were also available immediately, without waiting for boilers to raise steam. Most importantly though (and an advantage over centrally powered hydraulic cranes), electric cranes were now mobile along the dock edge on their own rail lines. Rather than ships queueing for a single berth space alongside a fixed crane, cranes could be brought to each ship's hold hatches as needed. This made a single crane far more efficient, in terms of cargo handled per day. Soon such mobile electric cranes were near universal.\n Five examples of electric cranes provided in 1951 have been preserved by Bristol Museum Service at Princes Wharf.\n In 1912, Stothert & Pitt's design team, led by Claude Topliss, developed an improved design of level luffing gear, which greatly improved the speed and efficiency of cargo handling cranes fitted with it. .[2] This used an arrangement of compensating hoist cables to automatically keep the hook, and load, level as the jib was luffed up and down.\n As cranes became more common in docks, and as ships became bigger, they also became more specialised. In 1927, Stothert & Pitt produced the first bulk-handling crane.[3] Rather than a simple hook that could handle a range of slung loads, this was a crane designed around the use of an integral grab. Working the grab requires extra cable or cables from the crane jib, so these are a whole specialised design. The first was to unload coal at a power station in London.\n Another innovation was the kangaroo crane. Rather than slewing (rotating) the crane to reach the delivery hopper on-shore, a kangaroo crane has its own in-built hopper beneath the jib, that slews with it. Dumping the grab contents into the hopper now only requires the quicker luffing movement, without needing to slew.\n In July 1915 the company took over the construction of the Pedrail Landship, an attempt to create an armoured fighting vehicle for use on the Western Front. The machine, designed by Colonel R.E.B. Crompton, a consultant to the Landship Committee, ran on a pair of pedrail tracks in tandem. It was intended to mount an armoured body on the chassis so that a party of troops could be carried across no-man's-land. After the Landship Committee decided against the machine, the War Office transferred construction to S&P, with a view to completing it as a mobile flame-thrower. The finished chassis was handed over to the Trench Warfare Department in August, but no further development took place.\n During World War II the company built tanks and miniature submarines for the War Office, as well as armaments.\n The Challenger tank was a development of the Cromwell tank chassis, so as to take the more powerful 17 Pounder gun. Stothert & Pitt built this tank and designed various modifications.[4] Lengthening the chassis from five roadwheels to six presented no difficulty for such an engineering firm, but designing armoured fighting vehicles was new to them and their efforts were not wholly successful. The new turret for Challenger carried the gun and its higher recoil well enough, but only by being nearly twice the height of other turrets for this chassis \u2013 making the tank a much easier target. The A30 (Avenger) tank destroyer was a similar development of a 17pdr gun on the same lengthened chassis, but had an open-topped turret 2\u00a0feet lower than that of Challenger. During the development of Challenger, the prototype turret was first mounted on the even larger TOG 2.[4]\n By 1974 Stothert & Pitt had built 30,000 single-drum pedestrian rollers.\n The firm was sold to Robert Maxwell's Hollis Group in 1986. Following the collapse of Maxwell's empire a management buy out was undertaken in 1988. But this failed and the company closed in 1989, resulting in all the works shutting down. The Stothert & Pitt name was sold to Langley Holdings, which now belongs to the NEI group owners of Clarke Chapman, and is operated for Dock crane consultancy. Despite ceasing all manufacturing operations, the company existing for consultancy, reference and repairs from their new headquarters at the Bradman Lake offices in Bristol.\n Stothert & Pitt moved from Bath to Bristol in summer 2008 and now occupy three office annexes in the Bradman Lake British headquarters on Yelverton Road in Brislington.\n", " Spartak Sofia is an ice hockey team in Sofia, Bulgaria.

They are managed by Sveaskog or by Statens fastighetsverk (the National Property Board of Sweden).\n In 1994 the total area covered by Kronoparks amounted to about 4.5 million hectares, almost 90% of which in Norrland and Dalarna. Starting in the 1870s the government began establishing the parks to limit the number of settlements that were being established on government-owned lands, though in the 1900s land in the individual Kronoparks was allotted to individual tenants. Kronoparks were established in Svealand and G\u00f6taland mainly through acquisitions of land by the state. By 1905 there were 1082 Kronoparks in Sweden.[1]\n During the past decades the area owned by the state has declined by about 5%, because parliament decided that Sveaskog should sell parts of its forest holdings to strengthen private forestry.\n", " Band of Sisters: American Women at War in Iraq is a 2007 book by Kirsten Holmstedt about the Iraq War and women in the military with a foreword by Tammy Duckworth.

Her area of specialization is plastic and reconstructive surgery. Kolb is a medical authority on the complications arising from breast implants, and has been an active voice in the debate about the safety of breast implant devices since 1996.[2]  She has treated over 2,000 women suffering from breast implant disease and related systemic immune disorders.[3]\n Susan Kolb was born on November 26, 1954, in Havre de Grace, Maryland.  She grew up with her parents, Doris and Gene Kolb, and an older brother, Charles Kolb.  As a child, she gravitated toward medicine, reading books on biology and genetics while still in grade school.[4] She graduated from Lawrence High School[5] in 1972 and attended Johns Hopkins University where she studied premedicine and graduated with honors in 1975.[6]  In order to continue her studies in medicine, she joined the U. S. Air Force Reserves.[7]  She attended medical school at Washington University and graduated in 1979 at the age of twenty-four.[8]  She was accepted at the University of Virginia for a surgical residency, but was called into service by the Air Force before her residency at UVA began.[9]  The Air Force sent her to Wilford Hall Medical Center, a 1,000-bed Air Force hospital at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX.  She completed on a three-year course of general surgery, followed by a plastic surgery residency.[10] She served as the Chief of Plastic Surgery at Wright Patterson Air Force Base from 1984-88.  During her time in the Air Force, she performed scar revisions, breast reductions, cosmetic surgeries, burn surgeries, hand surgeries, breast reconstructions, and body contouring surgeries. She established a craniofacial board that helped manage children with facial deformities.  She helped plan the surgical hospitals that would be later used in Desert Storm, especially as they pertained to burn care.[11]\n She left the Air Force 1988 as a Major and moved to Atlanta, Georgia.[12]  She joined a private medical practice in plastic surgery where she practiced for two years.  In 1990, she left her medical practice for six months to study spiritual medicine. When she returned to medicine, she incorporated holistic treatment methods.[13]  In 1995, she established Plastikos Surgery Center, where she incorporated several disciplines of holistic medicine including energy medicine, vibrational medicine and spiritual healing.[14]  In 1998, she founded Millennium Healthcare to address a broader range of medical conditions.[15] In 1999, she established Avatar Cancer Center to treat cancer and serious viral illnesses with integrative techniques.[16]\n In the 1990s, hundreds of thousands of women filed claims in lawsuits against breast implant manufacturing companies, asserting that they had been injured from silicone breast implants. Juries awarded a series of multimillion-dollar settlements to women with symptoms of systemic immune disorder, connective tissue diseases or neurological disorders.[17] A class action settlement of $4.25 billion, the largest in U.S. history,[18] resulted in Dow Corning filing for bankruptcy.[19]\n In 1996, Kolb wrote \"Doctor, Are You Listening?\", an article outlining the symptoms of silicone implant disease.[20] The article was published on various Internet sites, and her practice became known to women seeking treatment for silicone-related conditions. Many women complained that their health concerns were often dismissed or denied by the other doctors. In 2010, she documented her treatment of women with breast implant disease in her book The Naked Truth about Implants: From Harm to Healing.[21]  The book includes a detailed history of the implant controversy and a review of the major research into complications of breast implants. Dr. Douglas Shanklin, Emeritus Professor of Pathology, Laboratory Medicine, and Obstetrics and Gynecology, who along with Dr. David L. Smalley, published most of the pertinent research in silicone biochemistry,[22][23][24] wrote the foreword. The book outlines Kolb's treatment protocols and includes stories contributed by seven of her patients, as well as her own.\n Kolb has been interviewed about her experience treating breast implant problems including chemical and biotoxicity on the Today Show with Katie Couric, Holistic Health Show'' with Dr. Carl Helvie,[25] and Inside Cosmetic Surgery Today with Barry Lycka.[26] She has been interviewed for articles about breast implants in Glamour Magazine,[27] People Magazine,[28] and in Vanity Insanity, a Canadian television documentary[29] She was featured as a medical expert on an episode of Discovery Channel's \"Monsters Inside Me: Breast Implant Infection.\"[30]\n She has lectured and published articles on other topics, including 21st century medicine,[31] spiritual medicine,[32] environmental toxicity[33] and the benefits of integrating science and spirituality in the practice of medical healing.[34]  Kolb is also the author of \"The Spiritual Healer and Synthesis Medicine,\" a chapter in Goddess Shift: Women Leading for a Change, an anthology of the writings over forty women leaders.[35] In 2011, Kolb wrote \"Energy Management: A Blueprint for Optimism,\" which was published as a chapter in Optimism! Cultivating the Magic Quality that Can Extend Your Lifespan, Boost Your Energy ad make You Happy Now by Dawson Church and Stephanie Marohn.[36]  Kolb has hosted the monthly Atlanta Community Group for Noetic Science since 1996. Noetic Science, founded by astronaut Edgar Mitchell, is an organization dedicated to the study of extended human capability, integral health and healing, and emerging world views.\n Since 1998, Kolb has hosted a weekly radio show, The Temple of Health,[37] on BBS Radio. The show is broadcast live between 12:00 \u2013 1:00 pm EST each Saturday. Through interviews with authors, physicians, medical researchers and holistic practitioners, Kolb introduces a variety of medical topics related to traditional and holistic medicine, spiritual growth and fulfillment, scientific breakthroughs and various medical disorders. Her guests have included Dr. Bernie Seigel, Greg Braden, Dr. Andrew Weil and Dr. Amit Goswami.[38]\n Kolb's position on breast implant disease and the severity of complications arising from breast implant disease is controversial within the medical establishment. While earlier research studies suggested that certain autoimmune conditions may be related to breast implants, later research resulted in no conclusive epidemiological connection. Many plastic surgeons do not believe that these conditions exist and their position is supported by the American Association of Plastic Surgeons and the United States Food and Drug Administration. After removing silicone breast implants from the market (except in restricted circumstances) in 1992, the FDA re-approved them for consumer sales in 2006 as the result of later research. Kolb has questioned the wisdom of this move and has suggested that corporate interests have taken precedence over public health. She asserts that more recent research studies are flawed for several reasons: the elevation of epidemiological evidence over other traditional methods of diagnosis, such as clinical observation and pathology;[50] breast implant manufacturers and plastic surgeons played a major role in designing and conducting the research; and the studies were conducted over a three to five-year period.[51][52] Kolb associates the onset of symptoms of breast implant disease with the breakdown of the implants' elastomer shell which contains the silicone gel, which typically occurs between eight and twelve years after implantation.\n", " Ti lascio una canzone (English: Leavin' you a song) was an Italian musical variety show TV show that includes a competition between the most beloved songs in the history of Italian pop music.\n The songs, which represent the true stars of the show, are \u201cgolden oldies\u201d.

It lays above the Via Popilia, which followed the line taken by the modern railway.[4] The Romans gave it the status of municipium.\n The town was destroyed first by Alaric I in 410 AD, and then by the Saracens in the 9th and 10th centuries. Later it was a stronghold of the Principality of Salerno, with a massive castle built by Robert Guiscard.\n During the 1930s Eboli was able to expand into the plain after a project of land reclamation carried out by the Fascist government. It was severely damaged during the 1980 Irpinia earthquake.\n Eboli is located at the feet of Montedoro, a peripheral spur of the Monte Raione-Monte Ripalta group. Its territory, which is 90% plain, is formed by the alluvial plain of the Sele river, which bounds it southwards. The remaining part comprises hills part of the Monti Picentini Regional Park.\n Eboli borders with Albanella, Battipaglia, Campagna, Capaccio, Olevano sul Tusciano and Serre. Its hamlets (frazioni) are Campolongo, Cioffi, Corno d'oro, Fiocche, Santa Cecilia and Taverna Nova.\n The main attraction is the Colonna castle (11th century). Scanty remains of the ancient polygonal walls (4th century BC) can still be seen, as well as of a Roman imperial villa in the locality of Paterno. Eboli is also home to several 15th-16th century palazzi.\n The sacristy of St. Francis contains two 14th century pictures, one by Roberto da Oderisio of Naples. Also notable is the Badia (Abbey) of San Pietro alli Marmi (1076).\n A local saying, Cristo si \u00e8 fermato a Eboli ('Christ stopped at Eboli'), was used by 20th-century writer Carlo Levi as the title of a book, referring to the enduring poverty in Basilicata. Eboli was the location where the road and railway to Basilicata branched away from the coastal north-south routes.\n Secondary schools based in Eboli are:\n There is a film based on the book (in English, Christ Stopped at Eboli).\n \n"]
